TI  - An improved distributed sensing method for monitoring soil moisture profile using heated carbon fibers
VL  - 123
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture variation with respect to depth directly affects the engineering properties of soil and the health state of plants. At the present, there are few techniques that can satisfactorily quantify the vertical moisture profile within the soil medium. In this paper, a fiber optic sensor-based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technique is introduced for soil moisture profile mapping. In this technique, a carbon fiber heated sensing-tube (CFHST) is integrated into conventional fiber optic sensing cable to improve the sensitivity, accuracy and spatial resolution of the measurement of soil moisture profile. The CFHST consists of three parts: the inner tubing, the carbon fiber heated cable (CFHC) tightly wrapped on inner tubing, and the interface screws installed on both ends of the inner tubing. The length of a unit CFHST is adjustable according to the actual demand of a specified application. The power supply model and installation method in field are introduced. Laboratory tests were conducted to establish the relationship between soil moisture and thermal response of CFHST. A foundation pit dewatering test was also carried out to validate the field performance of this monitoring technique. The test results show that the borehole-embedded sensor monitored and recorded the continuous change of soil moisture profile accurately (RMSE = 0.046 m3/m3). This technique can effectively capture the distribution profile of soil moisture along the depth direction, which provides a new approach to investigate the physical and hydrological properties of soils.

TI  - Soil {Moisture} {Monitoring} in a {Temperate} {Peatland} {Using} {Multi}-{Sensor} {Remote} {Sensing} and {Linear} {Mixed} {Effects
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07; conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36). The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models.

AB  - Characterizing both spatial and temporal soil moisture (Î¸) dynamics at site scales is difficult with existing technologies. To address this shortcoming, we developed a distributed soil moisture sensing system that employs a distributed temperature sensing system to monitor thermal response at 2 m intervals along the length of a buried cable which is subjected to heat pulses. The cable temperature response to heating, which is strongly dependent on soil moisture, was empirically related to colocated, dielectric-based Î¸ measurements at three locations. Spatially distributed, and temporally continuous estimates of Î¸ were obtained in dry conditions (Î¸â‰¤ 0.31) using this technology (root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.016), but insensitivity of the instrument response curve adversely affected accuracy under wet conditions (RMSE = 0.050).

TI  - Monitoring live fuel moisture using soil moisture and remote sensing proxies
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Live fuel moisture (LFM) is an important fuel property controlling fuel ignition and fire propagation. LFM varies seasonally, and is controlled by precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and plant physiology. LFM is typically sampled manually in the field, which leads to sparse measurements in space and time. Use of LFM proxies could reduce the need for field sampling while potentially improving spatial and temporal sampling density. This study compares soil moisture and remote sensing data to field-sampled LFM for Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) in northern Utah. Bivariate linear regression models were constructed between LFM and four independent variables. Soil moisture was more strongly correlated with LFM than remote sensing measurements, and produced the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted LFM values at most of the sites. When sites were pooled, canopy water content (CWC) had stronger correlations with LFM than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or normalized difference water index (NDWI). MAE values for all proxies were frequently above 20 \% LFM at individual sites. Despite this relatively large error, remote sensing and soil moisture data may still be useful for improving understanding of spatial and temporal trends in LFM.

TI  - Monitoring agricultural soil moisture extremes in {Canada} using passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - 115
SN  - NA
AB  - Current methods to assess soil moisture extremes rely primarily on point-based in situ meteorological stations which typically provide precipitation and temperature rather than direct measurements of soil moisture. Microwave remote sensing offers the possibility of quantifying surface soil moisture conditions over large spatial extents. Capturing soil moisture anomalies normally requires a long temporal record of data, which most operating satellites do not have. This research examines the use of surface soil moisture from the AMSR-E passive microwave satellite to derive surface soil moisture anomalies by exploiting spatial resolution to compensate for the shorter temporal record of the satellite sensor. Four methods were used to spatially aggregate information to develop a surface soil moisture anomaly (SMA). Two of these methods used soil survey and climatological zones to define regions of homogeneity, based on the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) and the EcoDistrict nested hierarchy. The second two methods (ObShp3 and ObShp5) used zones defined by a data driven segmentation of the satellite soil moisture data. The level of sensitivity of the calculated SMA decreased as the number of pixels used in the spatial aggregation increased, with the average error reducing to less than 5\% when more than 15. pixels are used. All methods of spatial aggregation showed somewhat weak but consistent relationship to in situ soil moisture anomalies and meteorological drought indices. The size of the regions used for aggregation was more important than the method used to create the regions. Based on the error and the relationship to the in situ and ancillary data sets, the EcoDistrict or ObShp3 scale appears to provide the lowest error in calculating the SMA baseline. This research demonstrates that the use of spatial aggregation can provide useful information on soil moisture anomalies where satellite records of data are temporally short. Â© 2011 .

TI  - Predicting soil water content through remote sensing of vegetative characteristics in a turfgrass system
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Scouting to determine soil water status throughout a golf course or large athletic field complex is quite time consuming and requires numerous observations to characterize variability across the site. The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of a ground-based remote sensing system to predict soil water content through partial least squares regression analysis of canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) maintained at 12.7 mm and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) maintained at 6.3 mm during 2002 and 2003 on a Coland silty clay loam. Volumetric soil water at a 5 cm depth was measured by time domain reflectometry and was collected in conjunction with spectral radiance measurements obtained using a fiber optic spectrometer. Volumetric soil water content was best predicted with partial least squares regression analysis of creeping bentgrass canopy reflectance data with a maximum r2 of 0.64 (P {\textless} 0.001) 1 d before development of drought stress symptoms. Similar results were observed for canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass plots, indicating that this technology and method of data analysis may be useful in the development of automated turfgrass irrigation management systems.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Regional soil moisture distributions and changes are critical for agricultural production and environmental modeling. Currently, hundreds of satellite sensors exist with different soil moisture observation capabilities. However, multi-sensor collaborative observation mechanisms for improving regional soil moisture monitoring capabilities are lacking. In this study, a Spatial pattern and Temporal variation law-based Multi-sensor Collaboration (STMC) method is proposed to solve this problem. The first component of the STMC method deduces the regional soil moisture distribution and variation patterns based on time stability theory and long-term statistical analyses. The second component of the STMC method detects potential anomalous soil moisture events and immediately triggers the high spatial resolution sensor with the soonest pass-over time. In the detection phase, an anomalous soil moisture judgment (ASMJ) algorithm and high temporal resolution sensors (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2)) were utilized. Experiments conducted in Hubei province, China, demonstrated that the proposed STMC method was capable of accurately identifying of anomalous soil moisture conditions caused by waterlogging and drought events. Additionally, we observed that the STMC method combined the advantages of different long-term observation, high temporal, and high spatial resolution sensors synergistically for monitoring purposes.

TI  - Measurement of soil water content with dielectric dispersion frequency
VL  - 78
SN  - NA
AB  - Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is an inexpensive and attractive methodology for repeated measurements of soil water content (Î¸). Although there are some known measurement limitations for dry soil and sand, a fixed-frequency method is commonly used with commercially available FDR probes. The purpose of our study was to determine if the soil dielectric spectrum could be used to measure changes in Î¸. A multifrequency FDR probe was constructed with a 6-mm diameter, and a soil dielectric spectrum was obtained. Using the dielectric spectrum, the dielectric dispersion frequency (fd) was determined. It was discovered that changes in fdwere highly correlated with changes in Î¸, and a third-order polynomial equation (R2= 0.96) was developed describing the relationship. The effectiveness of fdfor Î¸ measurement was evaluated for three soils and a sand across a range of Î¸. The effects of soil temperature and soil salinity were also evaluated. Accurate measurements of Î¸ were obtained even in dry soil and sand. The root mean square error of the Î¸ estimated by the fdmeasurement was 0.021. The soil temperature and soil salinity had no measureable effects on Î¸ determination. The use of fdfor Î¸ determination should be an effective and accurate methodology, especially when dry soils, soil temperature, and/or soil salinity could potentially cause problems with the Î¸ measurements.

TI  - Graphene quantum dot soil moisture sensor
VL  - 233
SN  - NA
AB  - A soil sensor to measure moisture content in soil is fabricated and described. The sensor is based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and is highly sensitive. The simplicity of the process and use of an inexpensive material GQDs make it an affordable low cost sensing unit in comparison to existing soil moisture sensing units. It is a resistive micro-sensor with interdigitated electrodes (IDE) where MEMS fabrication process is used and GQDs serve as the channel material between IDEs. The sensor is tested in two different soil environments viz. white clay (passive soil) and bentonite clay (an active soil). The conductance of IDE structure with GQDs changes from 0.06 Ã— 10-61/Î© to 0.68 Ã— 10-61/Î© in white clay as the gravimetric moisture content changes from 4 to 45\%. For bentonite soil, the conductance of the sensor changes from 0.06 Ã— 10-61/Î© to 0.48 Ã— 10-61/Î© across the gravimetric moisture range of 11 to 90\%. The sensor shows higher sensitivity at higher moisture content which can be attributed to Grotthuss chain reaction and ionic conductivity. Response time of the fabricated micro-sensor is found to be 2-3 min which is the lowest response time reported for a resistive based soil moisture sensor. The sensitivity of sensor towards gravimetric moisture contents is 0.014 Ã— 10-61/Î© per percent increase in moisture content (1/Î©/1\%) for the white clay and 0.005 Ã— 10-61/Î©/1\% for the bentonite soil.

AB  - In this paper, we presented the development of a proximal soil moisture sensor that measured the soil moisture content of dairy pasture directly from the boom of an irrigator. The proposed sensor was capable of soil moisture measurements at an accuracy of Â±5\% volumetric moisture content, and at meter scale ground area resolutions. The sensor adopted techniques from the ultra-wideband radar to enable measurements of ground reflection at resolutions that are smaller than the antenna beamwidth of the sensor. An experimental prototype was developed for field measurements. Extensive field measurements using the developed prototype were conducted on grass pasture at different ground conditions to validate the accuracy of the sensor in performing soil moisture measurements.

TI  - NIR}-red spectra space based new method for soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 50
SN  - 1006-9313
AB  - Drought is a complex natural disaster that occurs frequently. Soil moisture has been the main issue in remote monitoring of drought events as the most direct and important variable describing the drought. Spatio-temporal distribution and variation of soil moisture evidently affect surface evapotranspiration, agricultural water demand, etc. In this paper, a new simple method for soil moisture monitoring is developed using near-infrared versus red (NIR-red) spectral reflectance space. First, NIR-red spectral reflectance space is established using atmospheric and geometric corrected ETM+ data, which is manifested by a triangle shape, in which different surface covers have similar spatial distribution rules. Next, the model of soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing (SMMRS) is developed on the basis of the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the NIR-red spectral reflectance space. Then, the SMMRS model is validated by comparison with field measured soil moisture data at different depths. The results showed that satellite estimated soil moisture by SMMRS is highly accordant with field measured data at 5 cm soil depth and average soil moisture at 0-20 cm soil depths, correlation coefficients are 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. This paper concludes that, being simple and effective, the SMMRS model has great potential to estimate surface moisture conditions.

TI  - Monitoring root-zone soil moisture through the assimilation of a thermal remote sensing-based soil moisture proxy into a water balance model
VL  - 112
SN  - NA
AB  - Two types of Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) modeling approaches can be applied to monitor root-zone soil moisture in agricultural landscapes. Water and Energy Balance (WEB) SVAT modeling is based on forcing a prognostic root-zone water balance model with observed rainfall and predicted evapotranspiration. In contrast, thermal Remote Sensing (RS) observations of surface radiometric temperature (TR) are integrated into purely diagnostic RS-SVAT models to predict the onset of vegetation water stress. While RS-SVAT models do not explicitly monitor soil moisture, they can be used in the calculation of thermal-based proxy variables for the availability of soil water in the root zone. Using four growing seasons (2001 to 2004) of profile soil moisture, micro-meteorology, and surface radiometric temperature measurements at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancements (OPE3) study site in Beltsville, MD, prospects for improving WEB-SVAT root-zone soil water predictions via the assimilation of diagnostic RS-SVAT soil moisture proxy information are examined. Results illustrate the potential advantages of such an assimilation approach relative to the competing approach of directly assimilating TR measurements. Since TR measurements used in the analysis are tower-based (and not obtained from a remote platform), a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of remote sensing limitations on the value of the RS-SVAT proxy. Overall, results support a potential role for RS-SVAT modeling strategies in improving WEB-SVAT model characterization of root-zone soil moisture.

TI  - Soil water content monitoring for irrigation management: {A} geostatistical analysis
VL  - 188
SN  - NA
AB  - With the increasing attention to site-specific or variable rate irrigation management, it is helpful to reconsider the quantity and placement of soil water monitoring locations in this context. Volumetric soil water content (Î¸v) was monitored using a neutron probe (NP) at 72 locations in a center pivot irrigated field in eastern Nebraska. Variance reduction and temporal stability analyses were performed on Î¸v from shallow (âˆ¼top 46 cm) and full profile (âˆ¼122 cm) readings for four monitoring cycles in the 2015 growing season and 2016 preseason. Eleven additional cycles were included for a subset of the data for the temporal stability analysis. The spatial correlation scale for Î¸v was found to be less than the closest spacing of monitoring locations in the study (i.e. {\textless}37 m). For this field site, approximately three neutron probe monitoring locations were required to determine mean soil water depletion (Â±2 cm) for the field or for a management zone. Little economy would be gained in variance reduction for areal mean Î¸v from using a stratified network for management areas of reasonable size in a center pivot irrigated field. Temporally stable monitoring locations were identified. However, relatively low-cost spatial predictor variables, including elevation, deviation from mean elevation, apparent electrical conductivity, and mean relative difference of interpolated cosmic ray neutron probe surveys, were not consistent predictors of NP mean relative difference. The small range of variability of Î¸v within the study field is thought to be a contributing factor. It is possible that for fields with similar variability, or for site-specific irrigation where zones have been selected to reduce within-zone variance, that sensor quantity is more important than sensor placement in quantifying the areal mean Î¸v for irrigation management.

TI  - Design of access-tube {TDR} sensor for soil water content: {Theory
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water measurement is important in water management for irrigation and hydrologic sciences. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a cylindrical access-tube mounted waveguide for use in time-domain reflectometry (TDR) for in-situ soil water content sensing. In order to optimize the design with respect to sampling volume and losses, we derived the electromagnetic fields produced by a TDR sensor with this geometry. Using this analytical derivation, the effects on sampling area, waveform shape, and losses while varying design and soil water content were examined. It was found that when the soil and tube substrate have identical dielectrics, then sampling area has a local extremum. Tube radius has the largest impact of any geometrical parameter on sampling area with increases in radius causing increases in sampling area. Increasing electrode separation angle increases the sampling area slightly. The effects on TDR waveform are greatest for soil water content, tube dielectric, and tube radius: where increasing any of these increase delay and dispersion. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Design of access-tube {TDR} sensor for soil water content: {Testing
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water measurement is important in water management for irrigation and in hydrologic sciences. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test the design of a cylindrical access-tube mounted waveguide for use in time-domain reflectometry (TDR) for in situ soil water content sensing. Several prototypes with varying geometrical parameters were constructed. The sensors were compared by evaluating the characteristics of reflected waveforms from a (200-ps) step pulse in different media, including air, triethylene glycol, deionized water, and over a range of water contents in sand and a clay loam soil. Sensors with greater separation between electrodes, achieved by means different tube diameters or the separation angles, tend to have greater field penetration in both sand and clay. In addition, sensors with the shortest electrode separation show greater sensitivity to soil electrical conductivity. Together, these trends demonstrate that the propagating electromagnetic fields above 0 Hz do not take the transverse electromagnetic form commonly assumed in the analysis of TDR probes.

TI  - A dielectric-based combined horizontal sensor for on-the-go measurement of soil water content and mechanical resistance
VL  - 171
SN  - NA
AB  - Precision agriculture is drawing widespread attention and increasing interest in the use of on-the-go sensors to extract soil and plant information. This new trend is evident from an increased number of (tillage) studies concerning the development of sensors for measuring physical soil properties. In this study, a new dielectric-based horizontal sensor was designed and stationary calibrated in pots for measurement of volumetric soil water content. Subsequently, the sensor was combined with a load cell and installed on a tine with thickness of 25 mm, and its dynamic performance was assessed. The load cell behind the tine measures horizontal soil mechanical resistance. In order to evaluate the on-the-go performance of this combined sensor, two experiments were carried out in a soil bin, with the purpose of (i) measuring soil water content along a transect of longitudinally variable water contents, (ii) investigating the difference in horizontal resistance force measured by either the combined (horizontal force and water content) or a single sensor (horizontal force only). The stationary calibration results showed that quadratic equations with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.989 and 0.918 could be fitted to the data points obtained from measurements in soil bulk densities of 1.5 and 1.2 g cm-3, respectively. The results of the soil bin experiments indicated that the response of the dielectric sensor to soil water content variations was reasonable, but that the output voltage of the sensor should be amplified for a better sensitivity and resolution. The presented combined sensor can provide useful information on soil physical properties towards site specific applications in soils. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring for climate research: {Evaluation} of a low-cost sensor in the framework of the {Swiss} soil moisture experiment ({SwissSMEX}) campaign
VL  - 116
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture measurements are essential to understand land surface-atmosphere interactions. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the low-cost 10HS capacitance sensor (Decagon Devices, United States) using laboratory and field measurements. Measurements with 10HS sensors of volumetric water content (VWC, Vol.\%), integrated absolute soil moisture (millimeters) over the measured soil column, and the loss of soil moisture (millimeters) for rainless days are compared with corresponding measurements from gravimetric samples and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. The field measurements were performed at two sites with different soil texture in Switzerland, and they cover more than a year of parallel measurements in several depths down to 120 cm. For low VWC, both sensor types present good agreement for laboratory and field measurements. Nevertheless, the measurement accuracy of the 10HS sensor reading (millivolts) considerably decreases with increasing VWC: the 10HS sensors tend to become insensitive to variations of VWC above 40 Vol.\%. The field measurements reveal a soil type dependency of the 10HS sensor performance, and thus limited applicability of laboratory calibrations. However, with site-specific exponential calibration functions derived from parallel 10HS and TDR measurements, the error of the 10HS compared to the TDR measurements can be decreased for soil moisture contents up to 30 Vol.\%, and the day-to-day variability of soil moisture is captured. We conclude that the 10HS sensor is appropriate for setting up dense soil moisture networks when focusing on medium to low VWC and using an established site-specific calibration function. This measurement range is appropriate for several applications in climate research, but the identified performance limitations should be considered in investigations focusing on humid conditions and absolute soil moisture.

VL  - 86
SN  - 2512-2789
AB  - Precise and region-wide information about soil moisture with a high spatial resolution is required for river flood plains to fulfil statutory provisions from the EU Water Framework Directive. Influenced by constraints like precipitation and vegetation cover, this complex parameter is often measured point-by-point. Continuous soil moisture products derived from remote sensing are currently available only at coarse spatial resolutions. In this context, plants are of special interest, as their growth and distribution is determined by soil properties. Plant characteristics can be utilized as indicators or proxies of mean soil moisture. This study focuses on the derivation of top soil layer moisture content based on these indicator values by synergistically utilizing different methods and active as well as passive sensors. Subsequently, a joint model was developed to derive a high spatial resolution soil moisture product for the investigated wetlands. This model reached a coefficient of determination of 0.93. The result is valuable to many different user groups like water or nature conservation authorities of all administrative levels. The implementation is mainly based on Sentinel-1 and -2 along with Landsat data sets. The high repetition rate of the Sentinel sensors can increase the classification accuracy of the bio-indicators by a precise mapping of the phenological stages. The results indicate that the method is transferable to other riparian areas to a certain degree. In addition, a time series analysis covering a period of 16 years based on a soil moisture index derived from Landsat data sets was realized. Changes in soil moisture, following restoration measures, emerge clearly and thus allow for a remote sensing-based monitoring of restoration success.

TI  - A solar-powered wireless cell for dynamically monitoring soil water content
VL  - 69
SN  - NA
AB  - In various agricultural activities, such as irrigation scheduling, tillage operation and nutrient management, soil water content is regarded as an essential parameter. For the demand of monitoring soil water dynamics at field scale, this study presents a solar-powered wireless cell that contained a water content sensor, two temperature sensors, an optical sensor, a communication module and a data-logger. To evaluate its feasibility in the field, three cells were independently installed in a bare plot, a maize plot and a sugarbeet plot in the summer of 2008. By a heavy rain event (20 mm, 6 h) during the experimental period, different responses of soil water content sensors were dynamically recorded and then analyzed under each canopy condition. In addition, to explore the possibility of reducing the dimensions of the cell under the condition of sufficient energy supply, various sizes of the solar panel were tested. The experimental results showed that the cell is promising to become a node of wireless network in the field. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Time-lapse monitoring of soil water content using electromagnetic conductivity imaging
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - The volumetric soil water content (Î¸) is fundamental to agriculture because its spatiotemporal variation in soil affects the growth of plants. Unfortunately, the universally accepted thermogravimetric method for estimating volumetric soil water content is very labour intensive and time-consuming for use in field-scale monitoring. Electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments have proven to be useful in mapping the spatiotemporal variation of Î¸. However, depth-specific variation in Î¸, which is important for irrigation management, has been little explored. The objective of this study was to develop a relationship between Î¸ and estimates of true electrical conductivity (Ïƒ) and to use this relationship to develop time-lapse images of soil Î¸ beneath a centre-pivot irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop in San Jacinto, California, USA. We first measured the bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa â€“ mS/m) using a DUALEM-421 over a period of 12 days after an irrigation event (i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12). We used EM4Soil to generate EM conductivity images (EMCIs). We used a physical model to estimate Î¸ from Ïƒ, accounting for soil tortuosity and pore water salinity, with a cross-validation RMSE of 0.04 cm3/cm3. Testing the scenario where no soil information is available, we used a three-parameter exponential model to relate Î¸ to Ïƒ and then to map Î¸ along the transect on different days. The results allowed us to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of Î¸ across the surveyed area, over the 12-day period. In this regard, we were able to map the soil close to field capacity (0.27 cm3/cm3) and approaching permanent wilting point (0.03 cm3/cm3). The time-lapse Î¸ monitoring approach, developed using EMCI, has implications for soil and water use and management and will potentially allow farmers and consultants to identify inefficiencies in water application rates and use. It can also be used as a research tool to potentially assist precision irrigation practices and to test the efficacy of different methods of irrigation in terms of water delivery and efficiency in water use in near real time.

TI  - Multiyear monitoring of soil moisture over {Iran} through satellite and reanalysis soil moisture products
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role for many hydrological applications including water resources, drought analysis, agriculture, and climate variability and extremes. SM is not measured in most parts of Iran and limited measurements do not meet sufficient temporal and spatial resolution. Hence, due to ease of operation, their global coverage and demonstrated accuracy, use of remote sensing SM products is almost the only way for deriving SM information in Iran. In the present research, surface SM (SSM) datasets at six subregions of Iran with different climate conditions were extracted from two satellite-based passive (SMOSL3) and active + passive (ESA CCI SM) microwave observations, and two reanalysis (ERA-Interim and ERA-Interim/Land) products. Time series of averaged monthly mean SSM products and in situ ground precipitation and temperature measurements were derived for each subregion. Results revealed that, generally, all SSM products were in good agreement with each other with correlation coefficients higher than 0.5. The better agreement was found in the Northeast and Southwest region with average correlation values equal to 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. It should be noted that the SSM datasets are characterized by different periods and lengths. Hence, results should be assessed with cautious. Moreover, most SSM products have strong correlations with maximum, minimum and average temperature as well as with total monthly precipitation. Also, trend analysis showed no trend for time series of monthly SSM over all subregions in the two periods 1980â€“1999 and 2000â€“2014. The only exceptions were the Southeast subregion for ERA-Interim and Center and Northwest subregions for the ESA CCI SM for which a negative trend was detected for the period 2000â€“2014. Finally, the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) calculated from ERA-Interim, ERA-I/Land and ESA CCI SM datasets showed that the Center and Southeast regions suffered from the most severe and longest-lasting drought events in the last decade.

TI  - Calibration and evaluation of a frequency domain reflectometry sensor for real-time soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil spatial heterogeneity poses a challenge to accurate soil moisture determination. Remote sensing, in particular, using sensors that acquire data at microwave frequencies, is being used to overcome this challenge. In situ soil moisture monitoring can be used to validate remotely sensed surface soil moisture estimates and as inputs for agronomic and hydrologic models. Nine in situ soil moisture stations were established in Manitoba (Canada) and instrumented with Stevens Hydra Probes. The sensors were installed in triplicate with vertical orientation at the surface and with horizontal orientation at the 5-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm depths. To ensure accuracy of the measured soil moisture, both laboratory and field calibrations were conducted. These calibrated soil moisture values were compared with the probe default values and those generated using published calibrations. Overall, the results showed that the field calibration was superior (coefficient of determination r2 of 0.95) to the laboratory calibration (r2 of 0.89). In addition, coarse-textured sites generally performed better than the fine-textured, high cation exchange capacity (CEC) sites. At the Kelburn site with high clay and CEC, the use of field calibration reduced the root mean square error from 0.188 to 0.026 m3 mâˆ’3. However, at the low clay and CEC Treherne site, gains in accuracy were minimal, about 0.005 m3 mâˆ’3. The laboratory calibration consistently underestimated soil moisture at all the evaluation sites, whereas both Topp and Logsdon calibrations overestimated soil moisture.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - This is an update to the special section â€œRemote Sensing for Vadose Zone Hydrologyâ€”A Synthesis from the Vantage Pointâ€ [Vadose Zone Journal 12(3)]. Satellites (e.g., Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP] and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [SMOS]) using passive microwave techniques, in particular at L-band frequency, have shown good promise for global mapping of near-surface (0â€“5-cm) soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 25 to 40 km and temporal resolution of 2 to 3 d. C- and X-band soil moisture records date back to 1978, making available an invaluable data set for long-term climate research. Near-surface soil moisture is further extended to the root zone (top 1 m) using process-based models and data assimilation schemes. Validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products has been ongoing using core monitoring sites, sparse monitoring networks, intensive field campaigns, as well as multi-satellite comparison studies. To transfer empirical observations across space and time scales and to develop improved retrieval algorithms at various resolutions, several efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes in various energy- and water-rich environments. We describe the most recent scientific and technological advances in soil moisture remote sensing. We anticipate that remotely sensed soil moisture will find many applications in vadose zone hydrology in the coming decades. Â© Soil Science Society of America.

TI  - An electromagnetic induction method for monitoring variation in soil moisture in agroforestry systems
VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - An understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil water extraction by trees in agroforestry systems has long been seen as an important step towards understanding their functioning. Traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93Â°S, 150.93Â°E). This technique provides methods for minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9 m of the soil profile (R2 = 0.93, s.e. = 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI techniques can provide a quick and efficient means for monitoring soil moisture patterns in agroforestry systems when employed under suitable conditions. This paper describes the techniques developed and where they may be employed, the type of information available from the approach, and the likely methods for employing EMI approaches in a wider range of situations.

TI  - Short, multineedle frequency domain reflectometry sensor suitable for measuring soil water content
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established electromagnetic technique used to measure soil water content. Time domain reflectometry sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable and cheap measurements of soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in future field studies. Â© Soil Science Society of America.

The proposed sensor consists of two separate parts: (1) A sensor head, which is a microstrip transmission line to be placed in the soil, and (2) an electronic transceiver which sends a sinusoidal wave into the sensor head at one end of the transmission line, and receives the traveled wave from the other end. Transmitter is basically a Colpitts oscillator, and the receiver is a phase detector that measures the phase shift due to velocity variation caused by the moisture content of soil. At a certain frequency, the velocity of a microwave traveling through a media depends on the permittivity of that media. The proposed sensor is implemented and tested on one sample of typical soil. The main advantages of the proposed sensor are its high accuracy, quickness of measurement, its low cost and ease of implementation. Since the sensor has low power consumption, it can be recommended for low-power applications such as wireless sensor network. Â© 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil water content estimation using a remote sensing based hybrid evapotranspiration modeling approach
VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) has evolved over the last 20 years with the development of more robust energy balance approaches and the availability of timely remotely sensed imagery from satellite sensors. This has allowed the use of remote sensing for near-real time water management in irrigated systems in the western United States. In this paper a hybrid ET approach is applied to irrigated and non-irrigated cotton fields at the BEAREX08 experimental site using airborne remote sensing inputs under highly advective conditions, taking advantage of the available root zone soil water content measurements for verification of model output. The modeling approach is based on coupling the Two-Source-Energy Balance (TSEB) and the reflectance-based crop coefficient models. The TSEB model provides estimates of real crop ET while the reflectance-based crop coefficient approach allows for updating the basal crop coefficient and the interpolation and extrapolation of ET between the dates of remote sensing inputs facilitating the maintenance of a soil water balance in the root zone of the crop. Actual ET estimates using the TSEB model were compared with measured ET using eddy covariance systems deployed in four cotton fields during the BEAREX08 experiment. Estimates of soil water content in the soil profile of both irrigated and rain fed cotton fields were compared with measurements at different depths using neutron probe observations. Data assimilation techniques were applied to update soil water content values using estimates based on actual ET from the TSEB model. Results indicate that the hybrid ET modeling approach using data assimilation produced reliable daily ET interpolated between remote sensing observations and significantly improved soil water content estimates throughout the root zone profile compared to applying the crop-coefficient technique in a water balance model without the actual ET inputs.

VL  - 9
SN  - 2073-4441
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture dynamics from local to global scales is essential for a wide range of applications. The field of remote sensing of soil moisture has expanded greatly and the first dedicated soil moisture satellite missions (SMOS, SMAP) were launched, and new missions, such as SENTINEL-1 provide long-term perspectives for land surface monitoring. This special issue aims to summarize the recent advances in soil moisture estimation from remote sensing, including recent advances in retrieval algorithms, validation, and applications of satellite-based soil moisture products. Contributions in this special issue exploit the estimation of soil moisture from both microwave remote sensing data and thermal infrared information. The validation of satellite soil moisture products can be very challenging, due to the different spatial scales of in situ measurements and satellite data. Some papers present validation studies to quantify soil moisture uncertainties. On the other hand, soil moisture downscaling schemes and new methods for soil moisture retrieval from GPS are also addressed by some contributions. Soil moisture data are used in fields like agriculture, hydrology, and climate sciences. Several studies explore the use of soil moisture data for hydrological application such as runoff prediction.

TI  - `{Free} {Line} {Sensing}', a new method for soil moisture measurements using high-voltage power lines
VL  - 8
SN  - 1569-4445
AB  - Large area integrated soil moisture measurement results are often required for meteorological studies as well as for geological, agricultural and natural disaster research. Commonly used sensors measure the soil moisture locally and exhibit a strong spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of most land surfaces. The new `Free Line Sensing' technology uses existing high-voltage power lines to detect variations in soil moisture below the lines. The electromagnetic field of an additional radio-frequency signal in the range of 50-500 kHz on the line is influenced by changes in the electric properties of the soil, e.g., after rainfall. This has been simulated using high-frequency software, the result being that variations of electrical conductivity or dielectric coefficient of the soil will lead to a measurable effect with power line sections extending over several kilometres. Measurements have been conducted on a 13 km long high-voltage power line. The resulting signal is evaluated with respect to amplitude and phase. Measurement data demonstrate the capability of the `Free Line Sensor' to monitor the integrated soil moisture of the Earth's surface and near subsurface over the area covered by the power line. The resulting signal of the `Free Line Sensor' strongly responds to precipitation events and the following drying of the soil. Comparison with soil moisture data obtained from gravimetric drying of soil samples reveals a good agreement.

TI  - Soil moisture profile effect on radar signal measurement
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze the behaviour of a backscattered signal according to soil moisture depth over bare soils. Analysis based on experimental vertical moisture profiles and ASAR/ENVISAT measurements has been carried out. A modified IEM model with three permittivity layers (0-1cm, 1-2cm, 2-5cm) has been developed and used in this study. Results show a small effect of moisture profile on the backscattered signal (less than 0.5dB). However, measurements and simulations have provided a more detailed insight into the behaviour of the radar signal and have shown that it was important to consistently use the same protocol when performing ground truth measurements of soil moisture.

TI  - An improved reflectometric method for soil moisture measurement exploiting an innovative triple-short calibration
VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques have become increasingly attractive for soil moisture evaluation thanks to their adaptability, low cost, and measurement accuracy. Many different TDR-based approaches are currently available for deriving moisture content: empirical calibration curve, empirical dielectric models, frequency-dependent dielectric mixing models, etc. Generally, TDR soil moisture measurements resort to multiple-rod probes, which provide good adhesion to the soil and ease of insertion. However, the typical configuration of such probes does not allow performing a short-open-load (SOL) calibration procedure, which is definitely necessary for retrieving accurate dielectric characterization from TDR waveforms. To overcome the impracticability of the traditional SOL calibration, in this paper, an innovative triple-short calibration (TSC) procedure for commercially available three-rod probes is proposed. First, the robustness of the TSC procedure is validated on well-referenced liquids, demonstrating that its application to TDR measurements leads to a substantial enhancement of the final accuracy in the evaluation of the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient. Successively, the TSC procedure is applied to TDR measurements performed on moistened sand samples. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed TSC method, applied to traditional TDR measurements in combination with a dielectric mixing model, leads to an accurate and effective moisture evaluation procedure. This goal is reached through an efficient optimization algorithm that minimizes the difference between experimental and theoretical reflection coefficients. Results show that the proposed strategy is a suitable candidate for low-cost, highly accurate, and easy-to-perform moisture content estimation of soils. Â© 2010 IEEE.

VL  - 48
SN  - 1548-1603
AB  - Landscape assessment of soil moisture is critical to understanding the hydrological cycle at the regional scale and in broad-scale studies of biophysical processes affected by global climate changes in temperature and precipitation. Traditional efforts to measure soil moisture have been principally restricted to in situ measurements, so remote sensing techniques are often employed. Hyperspectral sensors with finer spatial resolution and narrow band widths may offer an alternative to traditional multispectral analysis of soil moisture, particularly in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity. This preliminary research evaluates the ability of remotely sensed hyperspectral data to quantify soil moisture for the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW), Georgia. An airborne hyperspectral instrument with a short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) sensor was flown in 2005 and 2007 and the results were correlated to in situ soil moisture values. A significant statistical correlation (R-2 value above 0.7 for both sampling dates) for the hyperspectral instrument data and the soil moisture probe data at 5.08 cm (2 inches) was determined. While models for the 20.32 cm (8 inches) and 30.48 cm (12 inches) depths were tested, they were not able to estimate soil moisture to the same degree.

TI  - Estimation of {Surface} {Soil} {Moisture} from {Thermal} {Infrared} {Remote} {Sensing} {Using} an {Improved} {Trapezoid} {Method
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in energy and water partitioning in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. A reliable and operational algorithm is much needed to retrieve regional surface SM at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide an operational framework of estimating surface SM at fine spatial resolutions (using visible/thermal infrared images and concurrent meteorological data) based on a trapezoidal space defined by remotely sensed vegetation cover (F-c) and land surface temperature (LST). Theoretical solutions of the wet and dry edges were derived to achieve a more accurate and effective determination of the F-c/LST space. Subjectivity and uncertainty arising from visual examination of extreme boundaries can consequently be largely reduced. In addition, theoretical derivation of the extreme boundaries allows a per-pixel determination of the VI/LST space such that the assumption of uniform atmospheric forcing over the entire domain is no longer required. The developed approach was tested at the Tibetan Plateau Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network (SMTMN) site in central Tibet, China, from August 2010 to August 2011 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra images. Results indicate that the developed trapezoid model reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of observed surface SM reasonably well, with showing a root-mean-square error of 0.06 m(3)center dot m(-3) at the site level and 0.03 m(3)center dot m(-3) at the regional scale. In addition, a case study on 2 September 2010 highlighted the importance of the theoretically calculated wet and dry edges, as they can effectively obviate subjectivity and uncertainties in determining the F-c/LST space arising from visual interpretation of satellite images. Compared with Land Surface Models (LSMs) in Global Land Data Assimilation System-1, the remote sensing-based trapezoid approach gave generally better surface SM estimates, whereas the LSMs showed systematic underestimation. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the trapezoid method is most sensitive to field capacity and temperature but less sensitive to other meteorological observations and parameters.

TI  - Evaluation of a low-cost soil water content sensor for wireless network applications
VL  - 344
SN  - NA
AB  - Wireless sensor networks are a promising new in situ measurement technology for monitoring soil water content changes with a high spatial and temporal resolution for large areas. However, to realise sensor networks at the small basin scale (e.g. 500 sensors for an area of 25 ha), the costs for a single sensor have to be minimised. Furthermore, the sensor technique should be robust and operate with a low energy consumption to achieve a long operation time of the network. This paper evaluates a low-cost soil water content sensor (ECH2O probe model EC-5, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA) using laboratory as well as field experiments. The field experiment features a comparison of water content measurements of a forest soil at 5 cm depth using TDR and EC-5 sensors. The laboratory experiment is based on a standardized sensor characterisation methodology, which uses liquid standards with a known dielectric permittivity. The results of the laboratory experiment showed that the EC-5 sensor has good output voltage sensitivity below a permittivity of 40, but is less sensitive when permittivity is higher. The experiments also revealed a distinct dependence of the sensor reading on the applied supply voltage. Therefore, a function was obtained that allows the permittivity to be determined from the sensor reading and the supply voltage. Due to the higher frequency of the EC-5 sensor, conductivity effects were less pronounced compared to the older EC-20 sensor (also Decagon Devices Inc.). However, the EC-5 sensor reading was significantly influenced by temperature changes. The field experiment showed distinct differences between TDR and EC-5 measurements that could be explained to a large degree with the correction functions derived from the laboratory measurements. Remaining errors are possibly due to soil variability and discrepancies between measurement volume and installation depth. Overall, we conclude that the EC-5 sensor is suitable for wireless network applications. However, the results of this paper also suggest that temperature and electric conductivity effects on the sensor reading have to be compensated using appropriate correction functions.

TI  - A robust calibration method for continental-scale soil water content measurements
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations across a continental-scale network in a production framework that incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturerâ€™s nominal calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types. This resulted in negative (91\% of samples) and positive (5\% of samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (1s) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturerâ€™s nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to Â±0.017 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (Â±1s). A logistic calibration function further reduced the mean RMSE to Â±0.016 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (Â±1s) and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration applied by 18\% compared with the manufacturerâ€™s function. However, the uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (Â±0.022 cm3 cmâˆ’3), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content values increased to Â±0.028 cm3 cmâˆ’3 regardless of the calibration function used.

TI  - The soil moisture sensor based on soil dielectric property
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - As we know, soil dielectric property varies along with soil volumetric water content variation. In this paper, the high-frequency resonance measurements method is used to design the soil moisture sensor. Firstly, the high-frequency equivalent electronic model is built by soil and sensor circuit. The relationship between the soil volumetric water content and resonant frequency is established by means of the high-frequency equivalent electronic model analysis. Then, with the comparison test on red soil, moisture soil and paddy soil, the high-frequency resonance measurements method is proved to be effective in soil moisture detection. Finally, the influence of resonant frequency and ambient temperature on the relationship is analyzed. The calibration method of soil moisture sensor is given. The ideally measuring result of soil volumetric water content is obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study on soil moisture sensor design based on soil dielectric property, which covers circuit theory, hardware simulation, resonance frequency selection and temperature compensation. The hardware circuit which is used in soil moisture sensor has advantages of simple structure, efficient practicability. The experiment results show that the soil moisture sensor works well and suits for building large-scale agriculture wireless sensor networks. Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag London.

TI  - Soil moisture sensor calibration for organic soil surface layers
VL  - 5
SN  - 2193-0856
AB  - This paper's objective is to present generic calibration functions for organic surface layers derived for the soil moisture sensors Decagon ECH2O 5TE and Delta-T ThetaProbe ML2x, using material from northern regions, mainly from the Finnish Meteorological Institute's Arctic Research Center in Sodankyla and the study area of the Danish Center for Hydrology (HOBE). For the Decagon 5TE sensor such a function is currently not reported in the literature. Data were compared with measurements from underlying mineral soils including laboratory and field measurements. Shrinkage and charring during drying were considered. For both sensors all field and lab data showed consistent trends. For mineral layers with low soil organic matter (SOM) content the validity of the manufacturer's calibrations was demonstrated. Deviating sensor outputs in organic and mineral horizons were identified. For the Decagon 5TE, apparent relative permittivities at a given moisture content decreased for increased SOM content, which was attributed to an increase of bound water in organic materials with large specific surface areas compared to the studied mineral soils. ThetaProbe measurements from organic horizons showed stronger nonlinearity in the sensor response and signal saturation in the high-level data. The derived calibration fit functions between sensor response and volumetric water content hold for samples spanning a wide range of humus types with differing SOM characteristics. This strengthens confidence in their validity under various conditions, rendering them highly suitable for large-scale applications in remote sensing and land surface modeling studies. Agreement between independent Decagon 5TE and ThetaProbe time series from an organic surface layer at the Sodankyla site was significantly improved when the here-proposed fit functions were used. Decagon 5TE data also well-reflected precipitation events. Thus, Decagon 5TE network data from organic surface layers at the Sodankyla and HOBE sites are based on the here-proposed natural log fit. The newly derived ThetaProbe fit functions should be used for hand-held applications only, but prove to be of value for the acquisition of instantaneous large-scale soil moisture estimates.

TI  - Drought monitoring using high resolution soil moisture through multi-sensor satellite data fusion over the {Korean} peninsula
VL  - 237-238
SN  - NA
AB  - Droughts, typically caused by the deficiencies of precipitation and soil moisture, affect water resources and agriculture. As soil moisture is of key importance in understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and Earth's surface, it can be used to monitor droughts. In this study, a High resolution Soil Moisture Drought Index (HSMDI) was proposed and evaluated for meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts. HSMDI was developed using the 1 km downscaled soil moisture data produced from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2003 to 2011 (March to November) over the Korean peninsula. Seven products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite sensors were used to downscale AMSR-E soil moisture based on random forest machine learning. The downscaled 1 km soil moisture was correlated well with both in situ and AMSR-E soil moisture with the mean coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.29 and 0.59, respectively. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from 1 to 12 months, crop yields (for sesame, highland radish, and highland napa cabbage) and streamflow data were used to validate HSMDI for various types of droughts. The results showed that HSMDI depicted meteorological drought well, especially during the dry season, with a similar pattern with the 3-month SPI. However, the performance fluctuated a bit during the wet season possibly due to the limited availability of optical sensor data and heterogeneous land covers around the stations. HSMDI also showed high correlation with crop yield data, in particular the highland radish and napa cabbage cultivated in non-irrigated regions with a mean R2 of 0.77. However, HSMDI did not monitor streamflow well for hydrological drought presenting a various range of correlations with streamflow data (from 0.03 to 0.83). Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mobile {TDR} for geo-referenced measurement of soil water content and electrical conductivity
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - The development of site-specific crop management is constrained by the availability of sensors for monitoring important soil and crop related conditions. A mobile time-domain reflectometry (TDR) unit for geo-referenced soil measurements has been developed and used for detailed mapping of soil water content and electrical conductivity within two research fields. Measurements made during the early or late season, when soil moisture levels are close to field capacity, are related to the amount of plant available water and soil texture. Combined measurements of water content and electrical conductivity are closely related to the clay and silt fractions of a variable field. The application to early season field mapping of water content, electrical conductivity and clay content is presented. The water and clay content maps are to be used for automated delineation of field management units. Based on a spatial analysis of the soil water measurements, recommendations are made with respect to sampling strategies. Depending on the variability of a given area, between 15 and 30 ha can be mapped with respect to soil moisture and electrical conductivity with sufficient detail within 8 h.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture with the support vector regression technique
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - This letter presents an experimental analysis of the application of the Îµ-insensitive support vector regression (SVR) technique to soil moisture content estimation from remotely sensed data at field/basin scale. SVR has attractive properties, such as ease of use, good intrinsic generalization capability, and robustness to noise in the training data, which make it a valid candidate as an alternative to more traditional neural-network-based techniques usually adopted in soil moisture content estimation. Its effectiveness in this application is assessed by using field measurements and considering various combinations of the input features (i.e., different active and/or passive microwave measurements acquired using various sensor frequencies, polarizations, and acquisition geometries). The performance of the SVR method (in terms of estimation accuracy, generalization capability, computational complexity, and ease of use) is compared with that achieved using a multilayer perceptron neural network, which is considered as a benchmark in the addressed application. This analysis provides useful indications for building soil moisture estimation processors for upcoming satellites or near-real-time applications. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Feasibility of soil moisture monitoring with heated fiber optics
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate methods are needed to measure changing soil water content from meter to kilometer scales. Laboratory results demonstrate the feasibility of the heat pulse method implemented with fiber optic temperature sensing to obtain accurate distributed measurements of soil water content. A fiber optic cable with an electrically conductive armoring was buried in variably saturated sand and heated via electrical resistance to create thermal pulses monitored by observing the distributed Raman backscatter. A new and simple interpretation of heat data that takes advantage of the characteristics of fiber optic temperature measurements is presented. The accuracy of the soil water content measurements varied approximately linearly with water content. At volumetric moisture content of 0.05 m3/m3 the standard deviation of the readings was 0.001 m3/m3, and at 0.41 m3/m3 volumetric moisture content the standard deviation was 0.046 m 3/m3. This uncertainty could be further reduced by averaging several heat pulse interrogations and through use of a higher-performance fiber optic sensing system.

TI  - Feasibility of soil moisture estimation using passive distributed temperature sensing
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Through its role in the energy and water balances at the land surface, soil moisture is a key state variable in surface hydrology and land-atmosphere interactions. Point observations of soil moisture are easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS. Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1 m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables was known with greater certainty. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Soil moisture from remote sensing to forecast desert locust presence
VL  - 56
SN  - 0021-8901
AB  - Preventive control of desert locusts is based on monitoring recession areas to detect outbreaks. Remote sensing has been increasingly used in the preventive control strategy. Soil moisture is a major ecological driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current imagery toolkit for preventive management. By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution from a disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to help preventive management of desert locust. We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above 0.09cm(3)/cm(3) for 20days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may increase the chance to observe locusts 70days later. We estimate the gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation to be 3weeks. We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence. Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution should be used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest management. Foreign Language Abstract Resume La lutte preventive contre le criquet pelerin consiste a detecter le plus tot possible tout debut de pullulation. La teledetection est de plus en plus utilisee dans la strategie de lutte preventive. Bien que l'humidite du sol soit une variable ecologique majeure dans la dynamique des populations de criquet pelerin, elle manque a l'arsenal d'outils de teledetection pour cette strategie preventive. A travers des analyses statistiques qui relient les observations de presence/absence des criquets aux estimations d'humidite du sol a une resolution d'un kilometre issues d'un algorithme de desagregation, nous evaluons le potentiel de cet indicateur dans la gestion preventive du criquet pelerin. Nous observons qu'une augmentation de l'humidite du sol au-dessus de 0.09cm(3)/cm(3) pendant 20 jours suivie d'une diminution augmente les chances d'observer des criquets pelerins 70 jours plus tard. Nous estimons que cet indicateur permet de gagner trois semaines dans l'alerte precoce par rapport a l'utilisation d'indicateurs de vegetation. Nous demontrons que les erreurs de prevision de presence des criquets peuvent etre reduites en combinant dans des modeles statistiques plusieurs types d'indicateurs tels que l'humidite du sol et des indices de vegetation. Implications pour les politiques publiques. Nous recommandons l'utilisation operationnelle des estimations d'humidite du sol a 1 km de resolution dans la lutte preventive contre le criquet pelerin. Quand l'humidite du sol augmente dans une zone aride d'habitat potentiel du criquet pelerin, des prospections acridiennes devraient etre conduites dans les deux mois suivants afin d'evaluer le besoin d'effectuer d'autres mesures preventives. L'humidite du sol estimee par teledetection pourrait aussi etre utile dans la gestion integree d'autres ravageurs des cultures.

VL  - 55
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil moisture infrastructure is inadequate for largeâ€scale drought monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network program is the development of a near realâ€time drought monitoring product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing data. Data integration from diverse sources requires largeâ€scale validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land surface models; and Soil Moisture Activeâ€Passive, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agencyâ€Climate Change Initiative (ESAâ€CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Activeâ€Passive L3 is the remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil moisture data set in any region of the world. Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is an important indicator of drought; however, there are very few monitoring stations that directly measure soil moisture across the contiguous United States. Highâ€quality model and/or satellite remote sensing soil moisture estimates can help fill in the gaps of inâ€ground soil moisture measurements. However, integration of soil moisture data from diverse sources requires assessment of data quality. This study applies a series of methods for evaluating the integrity of inâ€ground, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets across the United States. The results indicate that the majority of inâ€ground sensors tested exhibit high data quality, although some exhibit high measurement error and/or low spatial representativeness. The results also indicate that the land surface models that are part of the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and the Soil Moisture Activeâ€Passive remotely sensed soil moisture products best match inâ€ground soil moisture measurement variability. Additionally, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Soil Moisture Activeâ€Passive data sets accurately depict drought occurrence. The methods applied here can be used to evaluate the quality of soil moisture data sets in any region of the world. Â© 2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - An extended kriging method to interpolate near-surface soil moisture data measured by wireless sensor networks
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - In the practice of interpolating near-surface soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) grid, traditional Kriging methods with auxiliary variables, such as Co-kriging and Kriging with external drift (KED), cannot achieve satisfactory results because of the heterogeneity of soil moisture and its low correlation with the auxiliary variables. This study developed an Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the aid of remote sensing images. The underlying idea is to extend the traditional Kriging by introducing spectral variables, and operating on spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm has been applied to WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to generate daily maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three traditional Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN data only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data as covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended Kriging shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Extended Kriging was found to be the smallest among the four interpolation results. This indicates that the proposed method has advantages in combining remote sensing information and ground measurements in soil moisture interpolation. Â© 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Field test of a multi-frequency electromagnetic induction sensor for soil moisture monitoring in southern {Italy} test sites
VL  - 529
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a variable of paramount importance for a number of natural processes and requires the capacity to be routinely measured at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., hillslope and/or small catchment scale). The electromagnetic induction (EMI) method is one of the geophysical techniques potentially useful in this regard. Indeed, it does not require contact with the ground, it allows a relatively fast survey of hillslope, it gives information related to soil depth greater than few centimetres and it can also be used in wooded areas. In this study, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture (SM) measurements were jointly carried out by using a multi-frequency EMI sensor (GEM-300) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes, respectively. The aim was to retrieve SM variations at the hillslope scale over four sites, characterized by different land-soil units, located in a small mountainous catchment in southern Italy. Repeated measurements of ECa carried out over a fixed point showed that the signal variability of the GEM-300 sensor (Std. Err. [0.02-0.1mS/m]) was negligible. The correlation estimated between point ECa and SM, measured with both portable and buried TDR probes, varied between 0.24 and 0.58, depending on the site considered. In order to reduce the effect of small-scale variability, a spatial smoothing filter was applied which allowed the estimation of linear relationships with higher coefficient of correlation (r 0.46-0.8). The accuracy obtained in the estimation of the temporal trend of the soil moisture spatial averages was in the range 4.5-7.8\% v/v and up to the 70\% of the point soil moisture variance was explained by the ECa signal. The obtained results highlighted the potential of EMI to provide, in a short time, sufficiently accurate estimate of soil moisture over large areas that are highly needed for hydrological and remote sensing applications.

VL  - 31
SN  - 1040-0397
AB  - In the present investigation, we report a voltammetric sensor based on Nafion modified screen printed carbon ink functionalized with 4-aminobenzo-18-crown-6 ether for the detection of soil potassium. The potassium is one of the major nutrient elements required by the plants and is critical for the crop productivity. The selective and sensitive assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of 4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown ether derivative and proposed simplicity of fabrication protocol makes the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil analysis.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC) and biomass production is important for sustainable resources management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron ratio (Nr) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear relationship between Nr and the aboveground biomass that allowed to continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22 kg/m2. This information was used together with measured belowground biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error from 0.046 to 0.013 cm3/cm3. We anticipate that future research on the Nr can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception, ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary and roving CRNS systems.

AB  - In this letter, the relationship between temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and subsurface soil moisture (SM) over crop and native grassland of the Argentine Pampas is analyzed. High correlation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.69) between TVDI and SM measurements was found at different soil depths. In addition, we found that the potential of this index to reflect subsurface soil wetness fluctuations depends on root system depth, root distribution in the soil, and physical soil characteristics. Results indicate that thermal and reflectance data combination could be used to monitor subsurface SM below vegetated areas. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of subsurface soil water content estimated from surface measurement using wavelet transform
VL  - 563
SN  - NA
AB  - Temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s. Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents. Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions. Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s {\textless} 256 h, while k at âˆ’10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h {\textless} s {\textless} 724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s {\textgreater} 724 h. Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Method of soil moisture measurement by impedance spectroscopy with soil type recognition for in-situ applications
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture sensor systems need extensive calibration processes because of the dependence on soil properties. A novel measurement method is presented which is based on impedance spectroscopy. This method takes advantage of impedance spectroscopy for the characterization of soil type and measurement of soil moisture with improved accuracy. A comprehensive compensation of cross-sensitivity effects is carried out. The soil type characterization was carried out by a multivariate analysis based on elaborated experimental investigations of different natural soils. The results show that the new measurement method provides a measurement accuracy that fulfills the requirements of respective applications. Â© Oldenbourg Verlag.

TI  - State of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 77
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential climate variable influencing land-atmosphere interactions, an essential hydrologic variable impacting rainfall-runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable constraining food security. Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to spatial variability and model structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.

TI  - Soil salinity impacts on l-band remote sensing of soil moisture
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - The recently launched Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is providing soil moisture observations at continental scales by measuring L-band microwave radiation emitted from the land surface. While its retrieval algorithms will correct for factors such as vegetation and surface roughness, it will not correct for soil salinity. This letter tests the assumption that soil salinity will have a negligible impact on L-band brightness temperature (T b) at SMOS scales using field data; airborne T b observations were collected in a saline groundwater discharge area near Nilpinna Station, South Australia. At the 500-m scale, the airborne observations of T b could not be reproduced using the baseline algorithm of the SMOS Level 2 retrieval scheme, without accounting for soil salinity in the model. The analysis in this letter shows that soil moisture retrieval errors of at least 0.04 m 3 m -3 (i.e., the entire SMOS error budget) will occur due to salinity alone in SMOS footprints with saline coverage as low as 25\% (possibly even much less). Consequently, fractional salinity coverage cannot be considered a negligible factor by microwave soil moisture satellite missions. Â© 2006 IEEE.

TI  - Laboratory characterization of a commercial capacitance sensor for estimating permittivity and inferring soil water content
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Ring-capacitor sensors are used widely for real-time estimation of volumetric soil water content Î¸ from measured resonant frequency f r, which is directly affected by the bulk soil permittivity Îµ. However, the relationship fr(Îµ) requires improved quantification. We conducted laboratory experiments to characterize the response of the Sentek EnviroSMART sensor system for a full range of e values from air to water and a range of temperatures. Water-dioxane mixtureswere placed into a solvent-resistant container equipped with custom tools for heating and mixing the fluid, removing air bubbles from sensitive surfaces, measuring permittivity in situ, and creating an axisymmetric metal disturbance to the electric field. Total capacitance C was measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to one sensor, while four other sensors provided replicated fr readings. The measured temperature response of free water permittivity was linear with a negative slope, which is qualitatively consistent with theory. A precise nonlinear relationship between Îµ and normalized fr was derived. The instrumental error in Îµ was RMSEÎµ 5 0.226 (for 3 {\textless} Îµ {\textless} 43), which corresponds to a measurement precision in Î¸(Îµ) derived from Topp's equation of RMSEÎ¸ = 0.0034 m3 m-3. Axisymmetric numerical simulations of the electric field supplemented the experimental results. The characteristic length scale for the distance measured radially from the access tube is 12.5 mm, meaning that 80 and 95\% of the signal are sensed within approximately 20 and 37 mm of the access tube, respectively. The results are crucial for scientific applications of the investigated sensor type to environmental media. Â© Soil Science Society of America.

TI  - Calibration of a novel low-cost soil water content sensor based on a ring oscillator
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - We evaluated the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE soil moisture sensor and found an increase in accuracy when a sensor-specific calibration was used to relate sensor response and dielectric permittivity. The effect of temperature on sensor response was accounted for by a correction function that was successfully tested on soil material. Wireless sensor networks are becoming more popular to monitor spatial and temporal variability of soil water content. The aim of this paper is to calibrate and test the newly developed SPADE sensor for wireless sensor network applications. During calibration, the measured sensor output is related to dielectric permittivity using an empirical calibration in liquids with well-defined permittivities. Using these calibration measurements, we have evaluated sensor-to-sensor variability and compared the accuracy of a universal calibration between sensor output and permittivity with a sensor-specific calibration. Our results showed that the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE sensor is larger than sensor noise and that a sensor-specific calibration can improve the accuracy of soil water content estimation as compared to a single universal calibration. To quantify the effect of temperature on the sensor output, we have derived a temperature correction function in a temperature range from 5 to 40Â°C. The results showed an underestimation for low temperatures (5 to 25Â°C) and an overestimation for high temperatures (25 to 40Â°C). A second-order polynomial function was fitted to the measurements with good agreement (R2 = 0.9831, RMSE = 0.1489). The transferability of the temperature correction function from reference liquids to soils was verified using saturated coarse sand and a silty loam soil sample. The temperature-corrected SPADE sensor measurements in soil showed good agreement with TDR measurements and corresponded well with theoretical predictions from a dielectric mixing model.

TI  - UAV} based soil moisture remote sensing in a karst mountainous catchment
VL  - 174
SN  - 0341-8162
AB  - Spatial distribution of soil moisture (SM) is a prerequisite for research and management of agriculture and ecology. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve SM data in highly heterogeneous landscapes. By investigating environmental factors (soil, vegetation and topography) and comparing different remote sensing sources (Landsat-8, Radarsat-2, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) V002 (ASTGTM2), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for karst mountainous catchments of southwest China, this study identified key controlling factors on the spatial distribution of SM and built a remote sensing model for SM estimation in highly heterogeneous landscapes. Results showed that vegetation type (35.7\%), aspect (7.7\%), height index (4.2\%), soil bulk density (3.3\%), soil total nitrogen (3.1\%), aspect interact with vegetation type (3.4\%) and soil total phosphorous (1.3\%) totally explained 58.8\% of the SM variability. The correlations between SM and topographic derivatives varied with DEM resolutions (1-50 m), and generally reached their highest values at 7 m for height index, slope gradient, and aspect, 16 m for flow accumulation and topographic wetness index, and 43 m for curvature. Partial least-squares regression analysis showed that optical and infrared bands from Landsat-8 and topographic derivatives from UAV photogrammetry DEM were more strongly con-elated with SM than other datasets. An empirical model (SM = 9.27 * 10(-2)HI - 1.82 * 10(-5) B5 + 0.519) with only height index and B5 band from Landsat-8 as inputs is proposed, as it shows acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE = 0.076). The results of this study provide useful information for SM remote sensing in karst mountainous area and similar heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Investigation of the influence of soil moisture on thermal response tests using active distributed temperature sensing ({A}â€“{DTS}) technology
VL  - 173
SN  - NA
AB  - In-situ thermal response testing (TRT) has become the most effective way to determine ground thermal parameters before developing renewable geothermal energy systems. However, these parameters may not be static when some hydrologic conditions in porous formation change with time. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the ground heat exchange performance using the active distributed temperature sensing (Aâ€“DTS) technology, which infers soil moisture by a thermal response caused by active electrical current. We evaluated the feasibility of this method by several lab experiments and a field thermal response test (TRT). Using this method, the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture content was established for silt, clay, organic soil and sand, respectively. To quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of soil thermal conductivity to moisture content, a new parameter called relative thermal conductivity (Î²), is defined to describe the effect of water bridges among soil solid particles on thermal conductivity. The lab test results demonstrate that soil moisture content has significant influence on thermal conductivity when the soil is nearly dry (Î² {\textgreater} Î²(cri)), but its effect becomes less evident when the soil is moist (Î² â‰¤ Î²(cri)). It is found that the relationship between soil moisture content and thermal conductivity can be well fitted by the Johansen model. The results of the field-scale TRT demonstrated the ability of the proposed technique to detect the effects of rainfall on soil thermal conductivity near the ground surface. The field test results also suggest that the soil thermal conductivity measured by in-situ DTS is larger than that obtained from soil samples in lab. However, for rock, the thermal conductivity acquired by DTS is less than the values collected in lab. Â© 2018

TI  - Estimating soil moisture using remote sensing data: {A} machine learning approach
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an integral quantity in hydrology that represents the average conditions in a finite volume of soil. In this paper, a novel regression technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented and applied to soil moisture estimation using remote sensing data. SVM is based on statistical learning theory that uses a hypothesis space of linear functions based on Kernel approach. SVM has been used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training from past data. The strength of SVM lies in minimizing the empirical classification error and maximizing the geometric margin by solving inverse problem. SVM model is applied to 10 sites for soil moisture estimation in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) in the western United States. The sites comprise low to dense vegetation. Remote sensing data that includes backscatter and incidence angle from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used to estimate soil water content (SM). Simulated SM (\%) time series for the study sites are available from the Variable Infiltration Capacity Three Layer (VIC) model for top 10 cm layer of soil for the years 1998-2005. SVM model is trained on 5 years of data, i.e. 1998-2002 and tested on 3 years of data, i.e. 2003-2005. Two models are developed to evaluate the strength of SVM modeling in estimating soil moisture. In model I, training and testing are done on six sites, this results in six separate SVM models - one for each site. Model II comprises of two subparts: (a) data from all six sites used in model I is combined and a single SVM model is developed and tested on same sites and (b) a single model is developed using data from six sites (same as model II-A) but this model is tested on four separate sites not used to train the model. Model I shows satisfactory results, and the SM estimates are in good agreement with the estimates from VIC model. The SM estimate correlation coefficients range from 0.34 to 0.77 with RMSE less than 2\% at all the selected sites. A probabilistic absolute error between the VIC SM and modeled SM is computed for all models. For model I, the results indicate that 80\% of the SM estimates have an absolute error of less than 5\%, whereas for model II-A and II-B, 80\% and 60\% of the SM estimates have an error less than 10\% and 15\%, respectively. SVM model is also trained and tested for measured soil moisture in the LCRB. Results with RMSE, MAE and R of 2.01, 1.97, and 0.57, respectively show that the SVM model is able to capture the variability in measured soil moisture. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with the estimates obtained from feed forward-back propagation Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) and Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR); and show that SVM model performs better for soil moisture estimation than ANN and MLR models.

TI  - Physical-based soil moisture retrieval method over bare agricultural areas by means of multi-sensor {SAR} data
VL  - 39
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - The main objective of this research is to develop, test and validate soil moisture retrieval method based on multi-source SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for bare agricultural areas. The Radardat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A SAR data were applied to retrieve soil moisture content in combination with the integral equation model (IEM) or calibrated integral equation model (CIEM). A straightforward inversion scheme was developed, which does not require the prior knowledge of surface roughness. The soil moisture content can be directly estimated using a look-up table (LUT) optimization method with multi-source SAR data as inputs. For validation purpose, in situ soil moisture content was measured during the period of SAR data acquisitions. The effectiveness and reliability of the soil moisture retrieval methods were evaluated based on the in situ measurements and cost function distribution graph. The experimental results indicate that the developed approach provided accurate soil moisture estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3) over the experimental areas. The distribution graphs of the cost function demonstrate the uniqueness and convergence of the estimated results based on multi-source SAR data. Either IEM or CIEM was employed to estimate soil moisture content, more accurate results were obtained with Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A data as inputs. The experimental results preliminary illustrate that the multi-source SAR data are promising for soil moisture retrieval over bare agricultural areas. The novelty of the presented research can be summarized as two aspects. Firstly, the multi-sensor SAR with different incidence angle, different frequency and different polarization were combined to estimate soil moisture content by means of the physical-based methods. The combination of the multi-sensor SAR data can effectively solve the ill-posed problem of soil moisture retrieval using physical models. Secondly, the CIEM was utilized to establish the soil moisture retrieval model, which transforms the three unknown parameters to two unknown parameters. Furthermore, the convergence and uniqueness of the estimated soil moisture were validated through distribution graphs of the cost function.

VL  - 19
SN  - 1525-755X
AB  - The complex interactions between soil moisture and precipitation are difficult to observe, and consequently there is a lack of consensus as to the sign, strength, and location of these interactions. Inconsistency between soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including the difficulty of demonstrating causal relationships, dataset differences, and precipitation autocorrelation. The purpose of this study is to explore these potential confounding factors and determine which are most important for consideration when assessing statistical coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. Soil moisture is assessed via three remote sensing datasets: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, and the Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture. Estimates of soil moisture are coupled with afternoon thunderstorm events identified by the Thunderstorm Observation by Radar (ThOR) algorithm, and dry soil or wet soil preferences for convection initiation are determined for over 16 000 thunderstorm events between 2005 and 2007. Differences in soil moisture datasets were found to have the largest impact with regard to determining wet or dry soil preferences. Precipitation autocorrelation is prevalent in the data; however, precipitation autocorrelation did not influence the results with regard to dry or wet soil preferences. Consideration of the convective environment (i.e., weakly or synoptically forced) did result in significant differences in wet/dry soil preference, but only for certain soil moisture datasets. The results suggest that observation-driven soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies should both consider the convective environment and implement multiple soil moisture datasets to assure robust results.

VL  - 25
SN  - 1063-0198
AB  - Substrate volumetric water content (VWC) is a useful measurement for automated irrigation systems. We have previously developed automated irrigation controllers that use capacitance sensors and dataloggers to supply plants with on-demand irrigation. However, the dataloggers and accompanying software used to build and program those controllers make these systems expensive. Relatively new, low-cost open-source microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensor-based irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications. We designed and built an automated irrigation system using a microcontroller, capacitance soil moisture sensors, and solenoid valves. This system effectively monitored and controlled VWC over a range of irrigation thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m(3).m(-3)) with `Panama Red' hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella) in a peat:perlite substrate. The microcontroller can be used with both regular 24-V alternating current (AC) solenoid valves and with latching 6- to 18-V direct current (DC) solenoid valves. The technology is relatively inexpensive (microcontroller and accessories cost {\textbackslash}107, four capacitance soil moisture sensors cost {\textbackslash}440, and four solenoid valves cost {\textbackslash}120, totaling {\textbackslash}667) and accessible. The irrigation controller required little maintenance over the course of a 41-day trial. The low cost of this irrigation controller makes it useful in many horticultural settings, including both research and production.

VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture is an important environment variable that is dominant in a variety of research and application areas. Acquiring spatiotemporal continuous soil moisture observations is therefore of great importance. Weather conditions can contaminate optical remote sensing observations on soil moisture, and the absence of remote sensors causes gaps in regional soil moisture observation time series. Therefore, reconstruction is highly motivated to overcome such contamination and to fill in such gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel image reconstruction algorithm that improved upon the Satellite and In situ sensor Collaborated Reconstruction (SICR) algorithm provided by our previous publication. Taking artificial neural networks as a model, complex and highly variable relationships between in situ observations and remote sensing soil moisture is better projected. With historical data for the network training, feedforward neural networks (FNNs) project in situ soil moisture to remote sensing soil moisture at better performances than conventional models. Consequently, regional soil moisture observations can be reconstructed under full cloud contamination or under a total absence of remote sensors. Experiments confirmed better reconstruction accuracy and precision with this improvement than with SICR. The new algorithm enhances the temporal resolution of high spatial resolution remote sensing regional soil moisture observations with good quality and can benefit multiple soil moisture-based applications and research.

TI  - Design of soil moisture distribution sensor based on high-frequency capacitance
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to obtain accurate real-time soil moisture data and the spatial distribution of soil moisture, the soil moisture measurement methods based on high-frequency capacitance edge field effect were analyzed, the structure of probe was studied, and a multi-channel soil moisture sensor was designed. Moreover, with the established two-dimensional trace planar capacitance probe model and the method of the finite element analysis, relationship between the structure of sensor probe and electric field intensity was studied and capacitance of the probe trace amount planar capacitance model was analyzed, the most optimal structure of sensor probe was determined. Design parameters of the probe which can achieve optimal sensitivity and detection range are: outer diameter 40 mm and inner diameter 38.4 mm for the probe copper ring electrode, axial length 20 mm and axial spacing 10 mm. The sensor is suitable for measuring the moisture of different type of soil. Moreover, the features of the profile soil moisture sensor were experimentally explored. The measurement accuracy reached Â±1.31\% with better stability and consistency. Sensor probes can be assembled according to the measurement depth and used to measure soil moisture of different crop root zone.

TI  - A wireless soil moisture sensor powered by solar energy.
VL  - 12
SN  - 1932-6203
AB  - In a variety of agricultural activities, such as irrigation scheduling and nutrient management, soil water content is regarded as an essential parameter.  Either power supply or long-distance cable is hardly available within field  scale. For the necessity of monitoring soil water dynamics at field scale, this  study presents a wireless soil moisture sensor based on the impedance transform  of the frequency domain. The sensor system is powered by solar energy, and the  data can be instantly transmitted by wireless communication. The sensor  electrodes are embedded into the bottom of a supporting rod so that the sensor  can measure soil water contents at different depths. An optimal design with time  executing sequence is considered to reduce the energy consumption. The  experimental results showed that the sensor is a promising tool for monitoring  moisture in large-scale farmland using solar power and wireless communication.

AB  - This paper describes the fringing electric field modeling and performance of four different shaped poly methyl methacrylate-coated capacitive sensors for soil moisture measurement. Experiments are carried out in the laboratory by placing the sensor inside the soil. The analytical solution for such fringing field system is difficult to obtain, so COMSOL Multiphysics software is used for modeling the capacitive sensor surrounded by the soil. Experimental data are compared with the software simulated value. Statistical root-mean-square error (RMSE) and percentage of normalized RMSE for polynomial fit are studied for the sensitivity and performance analysis. Effect of external temperature on the performance of the sensor is also discussed. The proposed signal conditioning circuit is implemented in printed circuit board to measure the output voltage with respect to capacitance change. Obtained results are transmitted through a global system for mobile communication module for remote observation of soil moisture. The thermogravimetric method is used for voltage to soil moisture calibration, and based on the experimental data, results are analyzed further. A review of some relevant fringing field capacitive sensors and their instrumentation system reported in past 7-8 years are studied for comparison with the proposed sensor system. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 49
SN  - 0008-7041
AB  - With the development of geographic information science and the progress in the research of scientific visualisation, the visualisation of multivariate geospatial data has attracted much attention. This paper discusses an IconMap-based visualisation technique that enables multiple geospatial variables be represented in a single raster layer. This is achieved by extending the conventional pixel-based image structure to the three-tiered iconic design. Thereby the spatial pattern generated by the interaction between multivariate geographic variables can be disclosed, and the goal of geospatial data mining is achieved. A visualisation case study on soil organic matter and nutrients for the Shuangliu County of Chengdu City, China, was performed using the proposed approach. The result shows that the static IconMap can better display the distribution tendency of the high-end and low-end soil organic matter and nutrients, and that the dynamic IconMap can both reflect the interaction between the organic matter and the nutrients variables, and display the soil fertility levels in a comprehensive way. Thus, the IconMap-based visualisation approach is a non-fused, exploratory analytical approach for multivariate data and valuable for visually analyse the soil fertility condition.

TI  - A {TDR} array probe for monitoring near-surface soil moisture distribution
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Near-surface soil conditions (i.e., moisture and temperature) moderate mass and energy exchange at the soilâ€“atmosphere interface. While remote sensing offers an effective means for mapping near-surface moisture content across large areas, in situ measurements, targeting those specific remotely sensed soil depths, are poorly understood and high-resolution near-surface measurement capabilities are lacking. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established, accurate measurement method for soil dielectric permittivity and moisture content. A TDR array was designed to provide centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface soil moisture. The array consists of nine stainless steel TDR rods spaced 1 cm apart, acting as waveguide pairs to form eight two-rod TDR probes in series. A critical aspect of the design was matching the spacing of the coaxial cableâ€“TDR rod transition to avoid unwanted reflections in the waveforms. The accuracy of the TDR array permittivity measurement (Â±1 permittivity unit) was similar to that of conventional TDR as verified in dielectric liquids. Electric field numerical simulations showed minimal influence of adjacent rods during a given rod-pair measurement. The evaporation rate determined by the TDR array compared well with mass balance data in a laboratory test. Near-surface soil moisture profile dynamics were monitored at centimeter-depth resolution using the TDR array in a field experiment where volumetric moisture content estimates (0â€“8 cm) were within 2\% of conventional three-rod TDR probes averaging across 0 to 8 cm and from 1- to 3-cm depths.

VL  - 28
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture stress and salinity are considered as a major form of land degradation in rain-fed agricultural regions. The study has been carried out for four distinct periods such as 2001, 2005, 2010, and 2015 that was selected according to the climatic variations that occurred more than a decade. The multispectral remote sensing-based empirical models were employed on Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager imageries to estimate the rate of soil moisture stress and salinity from 2001â€“2015. The rate of soil moisture stress has been magnified to 143\%, and salinity was increased by 70\% particularly from 2005â€“2010 when the drought period occurred. The reliability of identifying the saline-affected soils from the multispectral remote sensing models was significantly affected (R2 = 0.39) because of the extensive distribution of Nerium oleander plants and water logging state in the study region. The modified microwave water cloud model revealed the three-layer information such as N. oleander, soil, and vegetation such that an imaginary part of the dielectric constant derived from simplified Hallikainen empirical model has got good correlation (R2 = 0.73) with ground electrical conductivity measurements.

AB  - : Klemas, V.; Finkl, C.W., and Kabbara, N., 2014. Remote sensing of soil moisture: an overview in relation to coastal soils. Journal of Coastal Research, 30(4), 685-696. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208., Soil moisture plays an important role in the exchange of water and heat energy between the land and atmosphere and is used in studies of global climate change. Soil moisture data are also required for reservoir management, early warning of droughts, irrigation scheduling, and crop yield forecasting. Coastal soils in general span the gamut of soil properties necessary for agriculture and maintaining natural environments, including transitional wetlands. Beach characteristics, such as soil moisture, grain size and type, are needed for determining substrate-bearing strength, modeling beach erosion, and planning beach nourishment. Because microwave radiation from soil is strongly dependent on moisture content, soil moisture has traditionally been mapped with airborne microwave radiometers. Innovative antenna technology has enabled microwave radiometers on satellites, such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Aqua, to measure soil moisture on a global scale. Better corrections for surface roughness, vegetation cover, soil temperature, and topography must still be devised, and techniques for sensing soil moisture beyond the top few centimeters developed., (C) 2014 Allen Press

VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - Satellite remote sensing observations have the potential for efficient and reliable mapping of spatial soil moisture distributions. However, soil moisture retrievals from active microwave remote sensing data are typically complex due to inherent difficulty in characterizing interactions among land surface parameters that contribute to the retrieval process. Therefore, adequate physical mathematical descriptions of microwave backscatter interaction with parameters such as land cover, vegetation density, and soil characteristics are not readily available. In such condition, non-parametric models could be used as possible alternative for better understanding the impact of variables in the retrieval process and relating it in the absence of exact formulation. In this study, non-parametric methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic are used to retrieve soil moisture from active microwave remote sensing data. The inclusion of soil characteristics and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from infrared and visible measurement, have significantly improved soil moisture retrievals and reduced root mean square error (RMSE) by around 30\% in the retrievals. Soil moisture derived from these methods was compared with ESTAR soil moisture (RMSE similar to 4.0\%) and field soil moisture measurements (RMSE similar to 6.5\%). Additionally, the study showed that soil moisture retrievals from highly vegetated areas are less accurate than bare soil areas.

TI  - Operational readiness of microwave remote sensing of soil moisture for hydrologic applications
VL  - 38
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave remote sensing of soil moisture has been an active area of research since the 1970s but has yet found little use in operational applications. Given recent advances in retrieval algorithms and the approval of a dedicated soil moisture satellite, it is time to re-assess the potential of various satellite systems to provide soil moisture information for hydrologic applications in an operational fashion. This paper reviews recent progress made with retrieving surface soil moisture from three types of microwave sensors - radiometers, Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs), and scatterometers. The discussion focuses on the operational readiness of the different techniques, considering requirements that are typical for hydrological applications. It is concluded that operational coarse-resolution (25-50 km) soil moisture products can be expected within the next few years from radiometer and scatterometer systems, while scientific and technological breakthroughs are still needed for operational soil moisture retrieval at finer scales ({\textless} 1 km) from SAR. Also, further research on data assimilation methods is needed to make best use of the coarse-resolution surface soil moisture data provided by radiometer and scatterometer systems in a hydrologic context and to fully assess the value of these data for hydrological predictions.

TI  - Root zone soil moisture assessment using remote sensing and vadose zone modeling
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important hydrologic state variable critical to successful hydroclimatic and environmental predictions. Soil moisture varies both in space and time because of spatio-temporal variations in precipitation, soil properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics. In recent years, air- and space-borne remote sensing campaigns have successfully demonstrated the use of passive microwave remote sensing to map soil moisture status near the soil surface (â‰ˆ0-0.05 m below the ground) at various spatial scales. In this study root zone (e.g., â‰ˆ0-0.6 m below the ground) soil moisture distributions were estimated across the Little Washita watershed (Oklahoma) by assimilating near-surface soil moisture data from remote sensing measurements using the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique coupled with a numerical one-dimensional vadose zone flow model (HYDRUS-ET). The resulting distributed root zone soil moisture assessment tool (SMAT) is based on the concept of having parallel noninteracting streamtubes (hydrologic units) within a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The simulated soil moisture distribution at various depths and locations within the watershed were compared with measured profile soil moisture data using time domain reflectometry (TDR). A reasonable agreement was found under favorable conditions between footprint-scale model estimations and point-scale field soil moisture measurements in the root zone. However, uncertainties introduced by precipitation and soil hydraulic properties caused suboptimal performance of the integrated model. The SMAT holds great promise and offers flexibility to incorporate various data assimilation techniques, scaling, and other hydrological complexities across large landscapes. The integrated model can be useful for simulating profile soil moisture estimation and for predicting transient soil moisture behavior for a range of hydrological and environmental applications.

VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Field-based soil moisture measurements are cumbersome. Thus, remote sensing techniques are needed because allows field and landscape-scale mapping of soil moisture depth-averaged through the root zone of existing vegetation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of an empirical relationship to calculate soil moisture from remote sensing data of irrigated soils of the Apodi Plateau, in the Brazilian semiarid region. The empirical relationship had previously been tested for irrigated soils in Mexico, Egypt, and Pakistan, with promising results. In this study, the relationship was evaluated from experimental data collected from a cotton field. The experiment was carried out in an area of 5 ha with irrigated cotton. The energy balance and evaporative fraction (L) were measured by the Bowen ratio method. Soil moisture (q) data were collected using a PR2 - Profile Probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd). The empirical relationship was tested using experimentally collected L and q values and was applied using the L values obtained from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and three TM - Landsat 5 images. There was a close correlation between measured and estimated q values (p{\textless}0.05, R2 = 0.84) and there were no significant differences according to the Student t-test (p{\textless}0.01). The statistical analyses showed that the empirical relationship can be applied to estimate the root-zone soil moisture of irrigated soils, i.e. when the evaporative fraction is greater than 0.45.

TI  - Surface soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing: {Current} status, products \& future trends
VL  - 83-84
SN  - 1474-7065
AB  - Advances in Earth Observation (EO) technology, particularly over the last two decades, have shown that soil moisture content (SMC) can be measured to some degree or other by all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and a variety of techniques have been proposed to facilitate this purpose. In this review we provide a synthesis of the efforts made during the last 20 years or so towards the estimation of surface SMC exploiting EO imagery, with a particular emphasis on retrievals from microwave sensors. Rather than replicating previous overview works, we provide a comprehensive and critical exploration of all the major approaches employed for retrieving SMC in a range of different global ecosystems. In this framework, we consider the newest techniques developed within optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, active and passive microwave domains, as well as assimilation or synergistic approaches. Future trends and prospects of EO for the accurate determination of SMC from space are subject to key challenges, some of which are identified and discussed within. It is evident from this review that there is potential for more accurate estimation of SMC exploiting EO technology, particularly so, by exploring the use of synergistic approaches between a variety of EO instruments. Given the importance of SMC in Earth's land surface interactions and to a large range of applications, one can appreciate that its accurate estimation is critical in addressing key scientific and practical challenges in today's world such as food security, sustainable planning and management of water resources. The launch of new, more sophisticated satellites strengthens the development of innovative research approaches and scientific inventions that will result in a range of pioneering and ground-breaking advancements in the retrievals of soil moisture from space.

TI  - Regression kriging-based upscaling of soil moisture measurements from a wireless sensor network and multiresource remote sensing information over heterogeneous cropland
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The ground truth estimated by in situ measurements is important for accurately evaluating retrieved remote sensing products, particularly over heterogeneous land surfaces. This letter analyzes the role of multisource remote sensing observations on the upscaling of soil moisture observed by a wireless sensor network at the pixel scale via the regression kriging (RK) method. Three types of auxiliary remote sensing information are employed, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI; 90 m), Polarimetric L-band Multiband Radiometer brightness temperature (700 m), and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer TVDI (1000 m). Moreover, a comparison with the ordinary kriging method is analyzed. The spatial inferences show that the RK method is more accurate and that its spatial pattern is more consistent with the auxiliary data when the trend is successfully removed, particularly when spatial continuity is destroyed by irrigation. The ASTER TVDI has a higher resolution and stronger correlation with soil moisture and yields more accurate interpolation results than the other types of remote sensing information. Although medium-resolution data do not substantially contribute to capture the spatial patterns of soil moisture, such data may still improve the prediction accuracy. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture from optical and thermal remote sensing: {A} review
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale. Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and significant progress has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data can provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are proposed for future research. Â© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 17
SN  - 1002-0063
AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor in global hydrologic circulation and plays a significant role in the research of hydrology, climatology, and agriculture. Microwave remote sensing is less limited by climate and time, and can measure in large scale. With these characteristics, this technique becomes an effective tool to measure soil moisture. Since the 1980s, Chinese researchers have investigated the soil moisture using microwave instruments. The active remote sensors are characteristic of high spatial resolution, thus with launch of a series of satellites, active microwave remote sensing of soil moisture will be emphasized. The passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture has a long research history, and its retrieval algorithms were developed well, so it is an important tool to retrieve large scale moisture information from satellite data in the future.

TI  - Soil moisture variability of root zone profiles within {SMEX02} remote sensing footprints
VL  - 30
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture effectively provides soil moisture at a large scale, but does not explain highly heterogeneous soil moisture characteristics within remote sensing footprints. In this study, field scale spatio-temporal variability of root zone soil moisture was analyzed. During the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily soil moisture profiles (i.e., 0-6, 5-11, 15-21, and 25-31 cm) were measured in two fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Ames, Iowa, USA. Theta probe measurements of the volumetric soil moisture profile data were used to analyze statistical moments and time stability and to validate soil moisture predicted by a simple physical model simulation. For all depths, the coefficient of variation of soil moisture is well explained by the mean soil moisture using an exponential relationship. The simple model simulated very similar variability patterns as those observed. As soil depth increases, soil moisture distributions shift from skewed to normal patterns. At the surface depth, the soil moisture during dry down is log-normally distributed, while the soil moisture is normally distributed after rainfall. At all depths below the surface, the normal distribution captures the soil moisture variability for all conditions. Time stability analyses show that spatial patterns of sampling points are preserved for all depths and that time stability of surface measurements is a good indicator of subsurface time stability. The most time stable sampling sites estimate the field average root zone soil moisture value within Â±2.1\% volumetric soil moisture. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - ABSTRACT: There are different methods for soil phosphorus (P) availability assessment. Researchers have recently introduced a new method called diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) to evaluate P availability in soils. The aim of this study was manufacturing DGT gel using copolymerization of acrylamide and allylic double bonds agarose to replace the patented agarose as a cross-linker. We evaluated the efficacy of the prepared gel and used the assembled DGT with that gel in 10 calcareous soils. We compared the available P measured with the assembled DGT in those soils to Olsenâ€™s P measured in the same soils. Corn plant (Zea mays L.) was also grown in those soils in a greenhouse for two months. Results showed that the diffusion coefficient of P ions in the gel with 0.3\% of allylagarose at 25 Â°C was 6.9 * 10â€“6 cm2.sâˆ’1, implying that P ions were allowed to diffuse freely through the prepared diffusive gel. Measured P by the assembled DGT showed a close linear correlation (r2 = 0.98) with the P concentrations measured in soil solutions extracted by the Olsen method. This demonstrates the prepared allylagarose cross-linked gelsâ€™ efficiency and thus the reliability of the assembled DGT in easily and rapidly measuring the soilâ€™s available P. The P, as measured by the assembled DGT in the examined soils, indicated a little lower correlation coefficient (r = 0.77) than those measured by the Olsen method (r = 0.88). However, the CE values measured by DGT showed a good correlation with P uptake by the roots (r = 0.88, p â‰¤ 0.01). The best correlation between CE and P content in corn occurred for the measurements made after 48 h of DGT placement in soils. The 20-h measurements had about the same r value, indicating that 20 h is sufficient for the placement of DGT assembly in the soil before its removing and measuring the available P. According to our findings, acrylamideâ€”allylagarose gel as a diffusive gel in DGT was found to be suitable for P measurements in both aqueous solutions and soil. Â© 2016 Taylor \& Francis.

SN  - NA
AB  - The method presented in this letter enables, for the first time, quantitative assessment of soil moisture content in the upper part of the root zone using remote sensing. The data are obtained in a short time and at low cost. We present results of measurements following water application at various cumulative energies by Morin's rainfall simulator. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, providing improved resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Development and use of the tools described herein will make it easier to understand processes occurring at the soil-water interface, such as soil crusting, penetration, run-off and erosion. We emphasize the difference between the suggested technique based on microwave radiation at millimetre wavelengths with excellent resolution and microwave radiation with a wavelength of tens of centimetres and thus reduced resolution.

TI  - On the identification of representative in situ soil moisture monitoring stations for the validation of {SMAP} soil moisture products in {Australia
VL  - 537
SN  - NA
AB  - The high spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture complicates the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products using in situ monitoring stations. Therefore, a standard methodology for selecting the most representative stations for the purpose of validating satellites and land surface models is essential. Based on temporal stability and geostatistical studies using long-term soil moisture records, intensive ground measurements and airborne soil moisture products, this study investigates the representativeness of soil moisture monitoring stations within the Yanco study area for the validation of NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products at 3 km for radar, 9 km for radar-radiometer and 36 km for radiometer pixels. This resulted in the identification of a number of representative stations according to the different scales. Although the temporal stability method was found to be suitable for identifying representative stations, stations based on the mean relative difference (MRD) were not necessarily the most representative of the areal average. Moreover, those identified from standard deviation of the relative difference (SDRD) may be dry-biased. It was also found that in the presence of heterogeneous land use, stations should be weighted based on proportions of agricultural land. Airborne soil moisture products were also shown to provide useful a priori information for identifying representative locations. Finally, recommendations are made regarding the design of future networks for satellite validation, and specifically the most representative stations for the Yanco area. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - We describe a soil water content monitoring data set and auxiliary data collected at a 37 ha experimental no-till farm in the Northwestern United States. Water content measurements have been compiled hourly since 2007 by ECH2O-TE and 5TE sensors installed at 42 locations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m, 210 sensors total) across the R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm, a Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research Site stationed on complex terrain in a Mediterranean climate. In addition to soil water content readings, the data set includes hourly and daily soil temperature readings, annual crop histories, a digital elevation model, Bt horizon maps, seasonal apparent electrical conductivity, soil texture, and soil bulk density. Meteorological records are also available for this location. We discuss the unique challenges of maintaining the network on an operating farm and demonstrate the nature and complexity of the soil water content data. This data set is accessible online through the National Agriculture Library, has been assigned a DOI, and will be maintained for the long term. Â© 2017. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Evaluation of soil water content in tilled and cover-cropped olive orchards by the geoelectrical technique
VL  - 163
SN  - NA
AB  - Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was performed in southern Italy, under semi-arid climate, on a Haplic Calcisol soil of two rainfed olive orchards managed according to different soil management (Tillage - T, and Cover Cropping - CC), applied for 8years. The main aim was to test the usefulness of such geoelectrical method for the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of soil water content for water balance studies. For that purpose, the quality of univariate relationships between soil electrical resistivity (Ï) and volumetric soil water content (Î¸v) was tested.Three geoelectrical measurement campaigns were performed in the autumn-spring period of 2006-2007. For each campaign, 3 two-dimensional (2-D) geoelectrical tomographies were carried out in the pole-dipole array using a fixed electrode spacing of 0.25. m. 2-D apparent resistivity pseudosection data sets have been inverted using the software TomoLabÂ®. Each covered soil section was 3. m in depth and 11.5. m long. On 14 November 2006 and 18 April 2007 campaigns the ERI were followed by soil samplings carried out with auger directly below the respective geoelectrical profiles. Direct measurements of soil electrical conductivity and soil water content were conducted on the soil samples in situ and in the laboratory.Volumetric soil water content, Î¸v (mm mm-1), was significantly related to soil electrical resistivity data, Ï (Î© m), by the exponential model Î¸v=1.641 Ï-0.599 (R=0.866, n=84). This relation allowed to assess the change of soil water content in the two orchards during the autumn-spring period and to reveal that the CC plot was more efficient to intercept and store rainwater. ERI technique allowed to highlight differences between the systems in the dynamics of water distribution along the soil profile as an effect of the adopted soil management. In particular, such technique consented to easily evaluate the extent of water content of the deepest soil layers ({\textgreater}1.0m) evidencing a significant water reserve in the CC plot, convenient for the root system of rainfed olive trees in the driest months. Finally, the soil water content evaluated by means of the ERI technique was used for the short-term application of soil water balance which showed interesting data on the progress of water consumption during the autumn-spring period, particularly useful as operative indications for cover crops management.

VL  - 9
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - The inversion of remote sensing images is crucial for soil moisture mapping in precision agriculture. However, the large size of remote sensing images complicates their management. Therefore, this study proposes a remote sensing observation sharing method based on cloud computing (ROSCC) to enhance remote sensing observation storage, processing, and service capability. The ROSCC framework consists of a cloud computing-enabled sensor observation service, web processing service tier, and a distributed database tier. Using MongoDB as the distributed database and Apache Hadoop as the cloud computing service, this study achieves a high-throughput method for remote sensing observation storage and distribution. The map, reduced algorithms and the table structure design in distributed databases are then explained. Along the Yangtze River, the longest river in China, Hubei Province was selected as the study area to test the proposed framework. Using GF-1 as a data source, an experiment was performed to enhance earth observation data (EOD) storage and achieve large-scale soil moisture mapping. The proposed ROSCC can be applied to enhance EOD sharing in cloud computing context, so as to achieve soil moisture mapping via the modified perpendicular drought index in an efficient way to better serve precision agriculture.

TI  - Comparison of four soil moisture sensor types under field conditions in {Switzerland
VL  - 430-431
SN  - NA
AB  - Many environmental and hydrological applications require knowledge about soil moisture. Its measurement accuracy is known to depend on the sensor technique, which is sensitive to soil characteristics such as texture, temperature, bulk density and salinity. However, the calibration functions provided by instrument manufacturers are generally developed under laboratory conditions, and their accuracy for field applications is rarely investigated, in particular over long time periods and in comparison with other sensors types. In this paper, four side-by-side profile soil moisture measurements down to 110cm using three low-cost sensors and one high-accuracy and high-cost time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor are compared over a 2-year period at a clay loam site in Switzerland. The low-cost instruments include the (1) 10HS (Decagon Devices, United States), (2) CS616 (Campbell Scientific, United States), and (3) SISOMOP (SMG University of Karlsruhe, Germany) sensors, which are evaluated against the (4) TDR-based TRIME-IT/-EZ (IMKO GmbH, Germany) sensors. For the comparison, the calibration functions provided by the manufacturers are applied for each sensor type. The sensors are evaluated based on daily data regarding their representation of the volumetric water content (VWC) and its anomalies, as well as the respective temperature dependency of the measurements. Furthermore, for each sensor type the actual evapotranspiration is estimated using the soil water balance approach and compared with measurements from a weighing lysimeter. It is shown that the root mean square difference (RMSD) of VWC for the low-cost sensors compared to the TDR measurements are up to 0.3m 3/m 3, with highest values in near-surface layers. However, the RMSD for the VWC anomalies are lower compared to those for absolute values. We conclude that under the studied conditions none of the evaluated low-cost sensors has a level of performance consistent with the respective manufacturer specifications. Hence the derivation of site-specific calibration functions is vital for the interpretation of measurements with low-cost soil moisture sensors. Furthermore, some weaknesses of the tested low-cost sensors such as the lack of sensitivity in certain soil moisture regimes or spurious dependency on soil temperature, imply intrinsic issues with the measurements derived with this type of instruments. This is particularly critical for a number of environmental and hydrological applications, including the assessment of remote sensing measurements. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 11

AB  - In this study, a residual soil moisture prediction model was developed using the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) and model prediction approach in the Upper Blue Nile basin. The SCA has the advantage of capturing the nonlinear relationships between remote sensing variables and volumetric soil moisture. The principle of SCA is to generate a set of prediction cluster trees based on a series of cutting and merging process according to a given statistical criterion. The proposed model incorporates the combinations of dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and digital elevation model as input parameters. In this regard, two separate stepwise cluster models were developed using volumetric soil moisture obtained from automatic weather stations (AWS) and Noah model simulation as response variables. The performance of the SCA models have been verified for different significance levels (i.e., alpha = 0.01, alpha = 0.05, and alpha = 0.1). Thus, the AWS based SCA model with alpha = 0.05 was found to be an optimal model for predicting volumetric residual soil moisture, with correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.95 and 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3) during the training and testing periods, respectively. While in the case of the Noah SCA model an optimal prediction performance was observed when alpha value was set to 0.01, with r being 0.93 and 0.87 and RMSE of 0.043 and 0.058 m(3)/m(3) using the training and testing datasets, respectively. In addition, our result indicated that the combined use of Sentinel-SAR data and ancillary remote sensing products such as NDVI could allow for better soil moisture prediction. Compared to the support vector regression (SVR) method, SCA shows better fitting and prediction accuracy of soil moisture. Generally, this study asserts that the SCA can be used as an alternative method for remote sensing based soil moisture predictions.

TI  - Evaluating a dual-frequency-phase-shift soil moisture and electrical conductivity sensor
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - For soil water and solute transport research, time domain reflectometry (TDR) has been commonly used since its introduction to soil research in 1980 by Topp and his colleagues. Although TDR seems to be very versatile for laboratory and field experiments, it requires modest user skills for accurate measurements and the instrument itself is still expensive. A new soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) sensor was recently developed at a reduced cost. The new sensor independently measures soil water content, and soil bulk electrical conductivity using frequency phase-shift techniques, and soil temperatures using a thermistor. We evaluated the new sensor for measurements of water content, and EC using three different sensors in variably saturated soils. There was little deviation among the units for water content measurement except at near saturation. Separate exponential curves provided good calibrations for all the soils used in the full range of water content between air-dry and saturation. In saline water up to 54 mS mâˆ’1, the mV output in the EC measurement mode was linearly related to solution EC. Although slopes were quite similar among the three sensors, the intercepts differed from the manufacturerâ€™s calibration. The calibrations for volumetric water content and electrical conductivity provided by the manufacturer were not good enough for any use. The temperature effect on volumetric water content could be negligible or easily compensated with a simple formula. Little EC dependency of the sensor on volumetric water content was observed.

TI  - Precise irrigation scheduling for turfgrass using a subsurface electromagnetic soil moisture sensor
VL  - 84
SN  - NA
AB  - Instrumented weather stations are often used for evapotranspiration (ET) determination in order to estimate crop water use for irrigation scheduling. A direct estimate of crop water use by subsurface measurements of soil water content has been limited by the high cost of reliable soil moisture sensors. Recent advances in electromagnetic (EM) sensor technology have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing. Our objectives were: (i) to compare irrigation scheduling in turfgrass based on weather station ET estimates with those from a novel time domain transmission (TDT) soil moisture sensor and (ii) to apply a computer-based numerical model to simulate volumetric soil water content (Î¸) dynamics at the burial depth of the sensor and any drainage occurring below the turfgrass rooting depth. The TDT sensor was designed to directly connect to a custom irrigation controller or to interface a small display/control box with a conventional irrigation timer where irrigation scheduling is based on a threshold water content (Î¸Thresh). The sensor circuitry controlled the irrigation schedule by allowing the preprogrammed schedule to operate whenever the sensor-estimated water content (Î¸Sensor) dropped below Î¸Thresh. The TDT sensor was installed under Kentucky bluegrass with a nearby weather station providing estimates of ET for comparison over a period of approximately 7 weeks. The HYDRUS-2D numerical simulation model was used for predicting water content (Î¸Sim) in the soil profile. The model input requirements include the flow domain geometry and boundary conditions, along with estimates of evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, irrigation and root water uptake data. Relative to ET-based irrigation recommendations, the TDT system applied approximately 16\% less water when irrigating with a sprinkler having a relative application depth of 0.80 at the position of the sensor (i.e. fraction of the design application rate applied at the sensor). Relative to a fixed irrigation rate of 50 mm week-1, the TDT system applied approximately 53\% less water. Modeling results of the TDT sensor control indicated that no detectable water drained below the estimated 30 cm rooting depth of turfgrass when uncontrolled application events (e.g. rainfall) were ignored. Performance of the TDT system is dependent on the sensor burial depth and Î¸Thresh. The Î¸Thresh value is soil-type dependent and should be established via consideration of Î¸ at field capacity and permanent wilting point. The potential water savings with the TDT system is not only important to water conservation, but can save irrigators an estimated US\$ 5.00-100.00 per month based on average water prices in the US and a 1000 m2 irrigated turfgrass plot.

VL  - 86
SN  - NA
AB  - A combined horizontal penetrometer was designed for the on-the-go and simultaneous measurement of soil water content and mechanical resistance. The maximum sampling rate for both sensors was 10 Hz and the maximum operating depth was 20 cm. For the water-content sensor, its measurement principle depends on the electric field of the fringe-capacitance. In order to evaluate the applicability of this combined penetrometer, four experiments in the field were carried out. These experiments included: (1) soil water content profiles test; (2) soil compaction measurement test; (3) effect of the operating velocity on the water content and resistant force measurement; (4) effect of operating depth on the force measurement. The experimental results show that the combined horizontal penetrometer is a practical tool since it can provide more useful information of soil physical properties. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Performance evaluation of a recently developed soil water content, dielectric permittivity, and bulk electrical conductivity electromagnetic sensor
VL  - 213
SN  - NA
AB  - CS655 Water Content Reflectometer (WCR) (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) is a recently developed multiparameter electromagnetic sensor measuring volumetric soil water content (Î¸), bulk soil electrical conductivity (Ïƒb), and temperature. In this study, CS655 sensor's performance was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of liquids with known dielectric and salinity properties and soils featuring a wide range of conditions (including physico-chemical properties, water regimes and salinity of the water solution). The sensor's performance was analyzed in comparison with WET and ML2 theta probe (Delta-T Device Ltd, Cambridge, UK) dielectric sensors. It was found that CS655 apparent dielectric permittivity (Îµa) readings were higher than that of Topp's permittivity-water content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values, as much as 12 dimensionless permittivity units. The results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content (Î¸m) and Îµa was strongly linear (0.911{\textless}R2{\textless}0.997). The most accurate results were provided by the multi-point calibration method. Moreover, for the case of non-conductive soils, Kelleners's method provides similar Îµa values with CS655 sensor readings for a maximum Ïƒb value of about 0.8 dS mâˆ’1. Concerning the use of empirical calibration equations, which include the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in Îµa, the obtained results suggest that the equation Î¸=aÎµa+b+cÏƒb has a strong physical basis and adequate performance (RMSE{\textless}0.03 m3 m-3). Finally, the investigation of the Îµa-Ïƒb relationship revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the pore water electrical conductivity (Ïƒp), which is closely related to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that influences plants growth. The Malliki-Walzcak model provide more reliable Ïƒp predictions as compared to the Hilhorst model. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A new {TDR} multiplexing system for reliable electrical conductivity and soil water content measurements
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Commercially available time domain reflectometry (TDR) multiplexers share a common ground, which lead to inaccurate TDR measurements for closely spaced TDR probes or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. To overcome these problems a new eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed and tested that allows communication with standard TDR equipment. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a standard method to estimate soil water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. In many applications, several TDR probes are installed in soil columns or field setups, and TDR measurements are acquired using a multiplexing system. Commercially available multiplexers share a common ground, which might lead to inaccurate TDR measurements when probes are installed close together or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a new eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed that allows communication with standard TDR equipment. In a first step, the new multiplexer was tested to analyze channel noise and channel to channel variability for open reflection coefficients and travel times. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the channels for both the open reflection coefficient and travel times. Second, the 50C81-SDM multiplexer was tested using TDR probes installed in electrolyte solutions and a sand tank. In contrast to multiplexers with a common ground, they showed no interference of closely spaced TDR probes (spacing ranging from 5 to 95 cm). On the other hand, the SDMX50 multiplexer showed absolute differences in bulk electrical conductivities of {\textgreater}0.001 Sm-1 for high volumetric water contents and high bulk electrical conductivities. Measurements at a test site with high electromagnetic noise showed the applicability of the 50C81-SDM multiplexer in such environments, but only if the entire TDR setup was disconnected from the permanent power supply.

TI  - Repeated electromagnetic induction measurements for mapping soil moisture at the field scale: {Validation} with data from a wireless soil moisture monitoring network
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements are widely used for soil mapping, as they allow fast and relatively low-cost surveys of soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Although the use of non-invasive EMI for imaging spatial soil properties is very attractive, the dependence of ECa on several factors challenges any interpretation with respect to individual soil properties or states such as soil moisture (Î¸). The major aim of this study was to further investigate the potential of repeated EMI measurements to map Î¸, with particular focus on the temporal variability of the spatial patterns of ECa and Î¸. To this end, we compared repeated EMI measurements with high-resolution Î¸ data from a wireless soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring network for an extensively managed hillslope area for which soil properties and Î¸ dynamics are known. For the investigated site, (i) ECa showed small temporal variations whereas Î¸ varied from very dry to almost saturation, (ii) temporal changes of the spatial pattern of ECa differed from those of the spatial pattern of Î¸, and (iii) the ECa\&ndash;Î¸ relationship varied with time. Results suggest that (i) depending upon site characteristics, stable soil properties can be the major control of ECa measured with EMI, and (ii) for soils with low clay content, the influence of Î¸ on ECa may be confounded by changes of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution. Further, this study discusses the complex interplay between factors controlling ECa and Î¸, and the use of EMI-based ECa data with respect to hydrological applications. Â© Author(s) 2017.

TI  - In situ soil phosphorus monitoring probe compared with conventional extraction procedures
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - In this work, selective chemical sensors of phosphorus (PO43-) installed in PVC probes and their associated instrumentation were evaluated in soil solution phosphorous monitoring. The evaluation was carried out with the addition of a 0.1molL-1 P-PO43- solution in the soil, followed by data acquisition supplied by the probes; by collecting soil samples in the region where the probes were installed; and by phosphorus determination through conventional laboratory techniques. The phosphorus amounts were determined by spectrophotometry after the following extraction methodologies: Mehlich 1, Mehlich 3, and ionic exchange resin. The results, compared with the potentials registered by the probes, express the best correlation with the results obtained with the resin method. The results indicate good response of the sensors and the potential applicability of these probes to assist in the monitoring of soil nutrients, helping to establish rational processes in the use of fertilizers in crops.

TI  - Automated general temperature correction method for dielectric soil moisture sensors
VL  - 551
SN  - NA
AB  - An effective temperature correction method for dielectric sensors is important to ensure the accuracy of soil water content (SWC) measurements of local to regional-scale soil moisture monitoring networks. These networks are extensively using highly temperature sensitive dielectric sensors due to their low cost, ease of use and less power consumption. Yet there is no general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors, instead sensor or site dependent correction algorithms are employed. Such methods become ineffective at soil moisture monitoring networks with different sensor setups and those that cover diverse climatic conditions and soil types. This study attempted to develop a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in sensor type, climatic conditions and soil type without rainfall data. In this work an automated general temperature correction method was developed by adopting previously developed temperature correction algorithms using time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements to ThetaProbe ML2X, Stevens Hydra probe II and Decagon Devices EC-TM sensor measurements. The rainy day effects removal procedure from SWC data was automated by incorporating a statistical inference technique with temperature correction algorithms. The temperature correction method was evaluated using 34 stations from the International Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and another nine stations from a local soil moisture monitoring network in Mongolia. Soil moisture monitoring networks used in this study cover four major climates and six major soil types. Results indicated that the automated temperature correction algorithms developed in this study can eliminate temperature effects from dielectric sensor measurements successfully even without on-site rainfall data. Furthermore, it has been found that actual daily average of SWC has been changed due to temperature effects of dielectric sensors with a significant error factor comparable to Â±1\% manufacturer's accuracy.

TI  - Improved models of soil emission for use in remote sensing of soil moisture
VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave radiometer measurements of the Planck emission from soil can be used to estimate the near-surface soil moisture. A more straightforward and consistent model of this emission results if nonuniform, rather than uniform, plane waves are used. Adaptation of this new model to a layered medium representation for the soil is improved using a normalization that is based on the isothermal soil limit. The separate concepts of radiometer sensing depth and in situ sampling depth for soil moisture are examined and theory for the sensing depth is presented. Improved approximations (at 1413 MHz) to the full model for soil emission are developed since they are needed to construct algorithms that retrieve an estimate of soil moisture from the radiometer raw measurement. The error associated with the comparison of these remotely sense values against in situ measurements is calculated. Results suggest that this comparison error could be lowered if the soil moisture sampling depth was reduced to values less than 0.01 m from the currently used values near 0.02 m, although the effect of surface roughness has not yet been analyzed.

TI  - Calibration of soil moisture sensing with subsurface heated fiber optics using numerical simulation
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - The heat pulse probe method can be implemented with actively heated fiber optics (AHFO) to obtain distributed measurements of soil water content (Î¸) by using reported soil thermal responses measured by Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and with a soil-specific calibration relationship. However, most reported applications have been calibrated to homogeneous soils in a laboratory, while inexpensive efficient in situ calibration procedures useful in heterogeneous soils are lacking. Here we employed the Hydrus 2-D/3-D code to define a soil-specific calibration curve. We define a 2-D geometry of the fiber optic cable and the surrounding soil media, and simulate heat pulses to capture the soil thermal response at different soil water contents. The model was validated in an irrigated field using DTS data from two locations along the FO deployment in which reference moisture sensors were installed. Results indicate that Î¸ was measured with the model-based calibration with accuracy better than 0.022 m3 m-3. Â© 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Nutrient budget and soil nutrient status in greenhouse system
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper is based on nutrient budget and its effects on soil nutrient status in typical greenhouse system in China to provide a basis for raising the utilization rate of fertilizers and maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture in the greenhouse. By investigating the management of 18 representative greenhouses in Shouguang, Shandong Province, China, and analyzing both the greenhouse and open field soil samples, the soil nutrient budget and the trend of nutrient accumulation and translocation in soils were thus studied. The results under greenhouse system showed that the average annual inputs of N, P2O5 and K2O were 4 088, 3 655 and 3 437 kg ha-1, respectively. The total inputs of N, P2O5 and K2O provided by chemical fertilizers which are the main source of soil nutrient were 63, 61 and 66\%, respectively. The utilization rates of N, P2O5 and K2O were only 24, 8, 46\% and the input ratio among N, P2O5 and K2O (1:0.9:0.8) was quite different from the uptake ratio (1:0.3:1.4). It had caused the excess of N, P2O5 and K2O in the soil, and the theoretical surpluses were 3 214, 3 401 and 2 322 kg ha-1, respectively, for N, P2O5 and K2O. The level of the organic matter, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium was increased substantially, and their maximum level was observed in the topsoil (0-20 cm) with an average value being 1.4, 1.9, 21.2, 5.4, and 3.7 times higher than that of the open field soil, respectively. The greenhouse soils showed leaching of the nutrients, especially NO3-which would cause a potential risk to the quality of groundwater in the area. It is necessary to apply more organic manure and provide nutrients according to the crop requirements and soil fertility as it could not only produce high crop yield, but also be beneficial to balance the soil nutrient and improve the utilization rate of fertilizers. Further, there would be no significant surplus of nutrients which may leach out of soil to contaminate the environment. Â© 2010, CAAS.

TI  - Estimating surface soil moisture from {SMAP} observations using a {Neural} {Network} technique
VL  - 204
SN  - NA
AB  - A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2â€“3 day repeat frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m3m âˆ’3, 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m3m âˆ’3, 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.

TI  - Land-surface controls on near-surface soil moisture dynamics: {Traversing} remote sensing footprints
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - In this new era of remote-sensing based hydrology, a major unanswered question is how to incorporate the impact of land-surface based heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics at remote sensing scales. The answer to this question is complicated since (1) soil moisture dynamics that vary with support, extent, and spacing scales are dependent on land-surface based heterogeneity and (2) land-surface based heterogeneity itself is scale-specific and varies with hydroclimates. Land-surface factors such as soil, vegetation, and topography affect soil moisture dynamics by redistributing the available soil moisture on the ground. In this study, we determined the contribution of these biophysical factors to redistribution of near-surface soil moisture across a range of remote sensing scales varying from an (airborne) remote sensor footprint (1.6 km) to a (satellite) footprint scale (25.6 km). Two-dimensional nondecimated wavelet transform was used to extract the support scale information from the spatial signals of the land-surface and soil moisture variables. The study was conducted in three hydroclimates: humid (Iowa), subhumid (Oklahoma), and semiarid (Arizona). The dominance of soil on soil moisture dynamics typically decreased from airborne to satellite footprint scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased with increasing support scale for all three hydroclimates. The distinct effect of hydroclimate was identifiable in the soil attributes dominating the soil moisture dynamics. The near-surface soil moisture dynamics in Arizona (semiarid) can be attributed more to the clay content which is an effective limiting parameter for evaporation whereas in Oklahoma (humid), sand content (limiting parameter for drainage) was the dominant soil attribute. The findings from this study can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics and the potential improvement of hydrological models operating at footprints' scales.

TI  - Non-invasive soil moisture sensing based on open-ended waveguide and multivariate analysis
VL  - 265
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multivariate analysis to increase the performance and reliability of a novel method for a non-invasive sensing approach for measuring gravimetric soil moisture. Unlike time and frequency domain spectrometers, as well as impedance sensors, where probes should be inserted into the terrain, the proposed approach simply uses a waveguide faced to the soil surface. An open-ended waveguide spectrometer system was developed to acquire â€œgainâ€ and â€œphaseâ€ spectra, related to received and transmitted signals, in the 1.5â€“2.7 GHz range from river sand, lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) and silty clay loam soil samples. For each soil type, predictive models of the moisture (\%) were obtained and discussed by using multivariate tools (Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Square Regression and N-dimensional Partial Least Square Regression). The potentiality of the measurement technique was explored for both non-layered (homogeneous moisture) and layered (two layers with different, homogeneous moisture) soils. In validation tests, R2 values up to 0.989 (RMSE = 0.8\%, river sand gain) were observed for single layer test. For double layer test, R2 values up to 0.977 (RMSE = 1.4\%, LECA gain, top layer) and 0.962 (RMSE = 1.9\%, LECA gain, bottom layer) were obtained. A better accuracy was achieved with N-PLS combining â€œgainâ€ and â€œphaseâ€ spectra: R2 values increase up to 0.991 (RMSE = 0.9\%, LECA samples). The measurement results demonstrate that the non-invasive waveguide-based spectrometry together with the multivariate analysis is able to assess different moisture contents, with a high level of accuracy, both for non-layered and layered samples of soil with homogenous moisture.

TI  - Estimation of spatially enhanced soil moisture combining remote sensing and artificial intelligence approaches
VL  - 37
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - The main objective of this study is to combine remote-sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to estimate surface soil moisture (SM) at 100 m spatial and daily temporal resolution. The two main variables used in the Triangle method, that is, land-surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover, were downscaled and calculated at 100 m spatial resolution. LSTs were downscaled applying the Wavelet-Artificial Intelligence Fusion Approach (WAIFA) on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imageries. Vegetation fractions were also estimated at 100 m spatial resolution using linear spectral unmixing and Wavelet-AI models. Vegetation indices (VIs) were replaced with the vegetation fractions obtained from sub-pixel classification in the T-s-VI triangle space. The downscaled data were then used for calculating the evaporative fraction (EF), temperature-vegetation-dryness index (TVDI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), and temperature-vegetation index (TVX) at 100 m spatial resolution. Thereafter, surface SM modelling was performed using a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) modelling approaches. Results showed that the best input data set to estimate SM includes EF, TVDI, T-s, F-vegetation, F-soil, temperature (T), precipitation at time t(P-t, Pt-1, Pt-2), and irrigation (I). It was also confirmed that PSO-SVR outperformed the PSO-ANFIS modelling approach and could estimate SM with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.93 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.29 at 100 spatial resolution. Range of error was limited between-2.64\% and 2.8\%. It was also shown that the method proposed by Tang et al., (2010) improved the final SM estimations.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The fractional water content of soil plays a central role in the complex interactions between the Earth and its hydrological cycle. However, obtaining continuous measurements of wide-area soil moisture is difficult. In our study, a novel method for the remote sensing of soil moisture is explored that makes use of the variations in time delay on Loran-C surface waves. An analysis was carried out using such signals recorded over a three-week period at the University of Bath, Bath, U.K., from a Loran-C transmitting station in Northern France. Model data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used for calculation, calibration, and intercomparison. Reasonable correspondence between the soil moisture estimated using the Loran-C method and the ECMWF product was found for a soil depth of 0-28 cm. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Ground-penetrating radar for monitoring the distribution of near-surface soil water content in the {GurbantÃ¼nggÃ¼t} {Desert
VL  - 70
SN  - NA
AB  - In the GurbantÃ¼nggÃ¼t Desert, snowmelt-induced high soil water contents briefly create favorable conditions for the germination and growth of plants every spring. Monitoring the rapidly changing conditions in this time period demands fast and efficient methods for measuring soil water contents at the field scale. For this study, a series of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were carried out on sites characterized by semi-vegetated dunes both in April 2010 and 2011. We compare water contents calculated from the GPR direct ground wave signal to both point scale validation measurements by time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and gravimetric sampling. Our results show that GPR is an effective method to rapidly obtain a detailed image of the field scale soil water content distribution in the GurbantÃ¼nggÃ¼t Desert with an accuracy similar to TDR. Observed large scale soil water content variations are dominated by dune topography: During snow melting, melt water was found to trickle slowly from the dune ridges to interdune valleys, increasing the soil water content there while the dune ridges quickly started to dry down. In dune valleys, smaller scale near-surface soil water content changes were dominated by variations in the vegetation coverage, leading to snowmelt funnels at distinct locations: The snowmelt initially occurred around the stems and branches of plants, forming funnel-shaped melt water induced holes through the snow cover and leading to an increasing amount of melt water collected around these plant roots. Our comparison of data from 2010 to 2011 furthermore suggests a temporally stable distribution of near-surface soil water content. This has important ecological significance for controlling desertification and for restoring and reconstructing vegetation in the GurbantÃ¼nggÃ¼t Desert. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 42
SN  - 0703-8992
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) conducted in Manitoba, Canada, over a 6-week period in 2012 provided high-quality data for soil moisture and vegetation, captured over a wide range of conditions coincident with airborne active and passive microwave acquisitions. In this study, the dataset measured in SMAPVEX12 was used as the input data of the backpropagation (BP) neural network to analyze the potential of different data sources or combination of data sources in the research of soil moisture inversion. By the analysis and comparison of the results, some valuable conclusions have been obtained: (1) passive microwave data has a stronger and more direct connection with the near-surface soil moisture (top 0 similar to 6 cm) than the active microwave sensing (radar backscatter coefficient) does, because the active microwave is more sensitive to the confounding effects of vegetation and surface roughness. (2) For the active microwave data, some combination form of the horizontal transmit and horizontal receive (HH) and vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) is a more rational selection than only HH to serve as one of the independent information sources for extracting the soil moisture. (3) The optical vegetation information provides the rich vegetation information that is indispensable for the microwave remote sensing data, especially for passive remote sensing, to extract the soil moisture with the average correlation coefficient increased by more than 0.05, at least, when adding the optical vegetation data. (4) Two kinds of forms of the optical vegetation information, either Vegetation Water Content (VWC) or Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), show no obvious differences to provide as auxiliary information for microwave remote sensing data in extracting soil moisture.

TI  - Laboratory measurement of the dinsar response to spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture
VL  - 49
SN  - NA
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) has traditionally been used for the detection and accurate monitoring of surface movement in a scene and has found applications in fields such as mining subsidence and earthquake deformation. In these studies, the phase is understood to directly relate to the radial component of the physical deformation of the surface. In this paper, however, we use a novel combination of microwave and optical laboratory measurements to demonstrate the presence of persistent and coherent phase changes in a temporal sequence of DInSAR images, related solely to moisture change in a soil. This is confirmation of recent reports suggesting that, in some circumstances, the DInSAR signal may include a significant soil moisture signal. Laboratory measurements were used to obtain a set of high-resolution C-band DInSAR images of a sandy soil sample of an area of 2.0 m Ã— 1.8 m and a depth of 0.2 m, with the fractional volumetric water content varying between 0.1 and 0.4. To independently monitor the soil surface for physical movement, a time-lapsed set of high-resolution digital optical images was continuously acquired. Although the soil underwent a large moisture change, the soil surface was static to within Â±0.1 mm over the majority of the experiment. The DInSAR sequence displayed dynamic and complex variations of the phase, although a linear relationship with moisture change was evident when the mean phase change was considered. The work raises the possibility that DInSAR could be used for the monitoring of soil moisture change in a scene, a parameter of significant economic and environmental importance. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Measurement of soil moisture content under physical crust by millimetre-wave backscattering
VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - Summary: This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method, therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0-3 cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the depth of the entire upper root zone (0-30 cm) and of the plough layer (0-20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further development and use of the method described herein will make it simple and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the soil-water interface. The major processes for which this information is important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and evaporation) and soil erosion. Â© 2014 British Society of Soil Science.

TI  - Performance analysis and calibration of a new low-cost capacitance soil moisture sensor
VL  - 138
SN  - NA
AB  - Several newly developed sensors based on capacitance and frequency techniques have simplified real-time determination of soil water content (Î¸). The 10HS sensor is one of the most recent developments in capacitance sensors. However, up to now, little is known about the accuracy of this sensor, and the dependency of its measurements on soil type and environmental factors. In this study, the performance of the 10HS sensor was investigated through experiments using liquids with known dielectric properties and experiments in a set of porous media exhibiting a wide range of properties. The response of the 10HS sensor in bilayered systems was also investigated. The experimental results suggested that there is a distinct instrument sensitivity to soil type, indicating the need for individual soil calibration. A set of specific calibration equations for the various porous materials studied were proposed. It was shown that the 10HS sensor is able to provide reasonably accurate relative permittivity (Îµr) measurements, but the manufacturer's Îµr calibration equation, to some extent, overestimates Îµr in the full range of the measured values in liquids. The sensor to sensor variability was also found to be relatively small. It was shown that the manufacturer's calibration equation for measuring Î¸ Version 1 underestimates Î¸, whereas Version 3 overestimates Î¸, in all porous materials examined. The most accurate results were provided by the proposed soil-specific calibration equations obtained using the multipoint calibration equations. However, the two-point calibration equations reasonably represent Î¸ in all porous media tested. Underestimation of soil moisture with increasing temperature in coarse porous media and overestimation in fine porous media were observed. The temperature dependence was more important in the fine porous media. The effect of electrical conductivities in sand was also examined, and it was found to be negligible. Finally, the sensors' response in bilayered systems generally follows the refractive averaging scheme at lower Îµr values and the arithmetic averaging scheme at higher Îµr values.

TI  - Temperature compensation in a low cost frequency domain (capacitance based) soil moisture sensor
VL  - 183
SN  - NA
AB  - Frequency Domain Analysis is a well established technique in soil moisture determination, using the change in electrical capacitance of probes inserted into the soil caused by the presence of water. However it is known that temperature affects the determination of this capacitance. Here two different techniques are used, the first passing a fixed frequency through the soil via insulated probes, then measuring the amplitude of the resultant signal. The second uses the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency oscillator, measuring the resultant times to charge and discharge. The measured capacitance is seen to be affected both by the temperature of the soil and, due to the sensitive nature of the monitoring electronics, also the temperature of critical components in the measurement circuits. Results from these experiments show that these two effects are complementary, soil temperature adding to the measured capacitance, whilst electronics temperature effectively decreases the measured capacitance. The daily profiles of the soil and electronics temperatures, whilst both rising during the day, and falling at night, show significant phase difference and therefore do not simply cancel out. Further, the strength of temperature compensation required is shown to vary with technique and moisture level. This paper explores these phenomena using results from a recently developed, four probe Frequency Domain capacitance based sensor costing around 12 Euros. These measurements are compared to those achieved by a commercial soil moisture system costing over 250 times this price. Preliminary results are presented from temperature compensation algorithms intended to minimize these effects. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil water content determination with cosmic-ray neutron sensor: {Correcting} aboveground hydrogen effects with thermal/fast neutron ratio
VL  - 540
SN  - NA
AB  - The cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS), which estimates field scale soil water content, bridges the gap between point measurement and remote sensing. The accuracy of CRNS measurements, however, is affected by additional hydrogen pools (e.g., vegetation, snow, and rainfall interception). The objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of CRNS estimates in a farmland system using depth and horizontal weighted point measurements, (ii) introduce a novel method for estimating the amounts of hydrogen from biomass and snow cover in CRNS data, and (iii) propose a simple approach for correcting the influences of aboveground hydrogen pool (expressed as aboveground water equivalent, AWE) on CRNS measurements. A field experiment was conducted in northeast China to compare soil water content results from CRNS to in-situ data with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe (NP) in the 0â€“40 cm soil layers. The biomass water equivalent (BWE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) were observed to have separate linear relationships with the thermal/fast neutron ratio, and the dynamics of BWE and SWE were estimated correctly in the crop seasons and snow-covered seasons, respectively. A simple approach, which considered the AWE, AWE at calibration, and the effective measurement depth of CRNS, was introduced to correct the errors caused by BWE and SWE. After correction, the correlation coefficients between soil water contents determined by CRNS and TDR were 0.79 and 0.77 during the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons, respectively, and CRNS measurements had RMSEs of 0.028, 0.030, and 0.039 m3 mâˆ’3 in the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons and the snow-covered seasons, respectively. The experimental results also indicated that the accuracies of CRNS estimated BWE and SWE were affected by the distributions of aboveground hydrogen pools, which were related to the height of the CRNS device above ground surface.

TI  - First results of all-weather soil moisture retrieval from an optical/thermal infrared remote-sensing-based operational system in {China
VL  - 40
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) content plays an important role in a number of physical processes involving the energy and mass exchanges between the land and atmosphere interactions. Determination of spatially complete SSM in regional scale has long been one of the most significant tasks in remote-sensing community. Although with limited penetrating ability comparing to microwave missions, optical/thermal infrared sensors can provide surface observations at finer spatial resolution. On the basis of a recently developed approach for deriving all-weather SSM content from satellite images, the present study investigates an optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system for mapping finer spatial resolution all-weather soil moisture content in China from the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological products. A preliminary evaluation of the all-weather SSM retrieval is implemented with field SSM measurements at 461 sites across China. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) varies from 0.053 to 0.070m(3) m(-3) with an average RMSE of 0.063m(3) m(-3) and an average bias of -0.018m(3) m(-3) obtained on the six selected days from April to September. These first results of all-weather SSM retrieval indicate that the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system has a promising perspective for mapping SSM with currently available satellite and meteorological products in regional scale. Finally, two practical recommendations with respective to improve the system inputs for producing more reliable SSM products are summarized for further developments of the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system.

VL  - 7
SN  - 2072-4292
AB  - We present a flexible, integrated statistical-based modeling approach to improve the robustness of soil moisture data predictions. We apply this approach in exploring the consequence of different choices of leading predictors and covariates. Competing models, predictors, covariates and changing spatial correlation are often ignored in empirical analyses and validation studies. An optimal choice of model and predictors may, however, provide a more consistent and reliable explanation of the high environmental variability and stochasticity of soil moisture observational data. We integrate active polarimetric satellite remote-sensing data (RADARSAT-2, C-band) with ground-based in-situ data across an agricultural monitoring site in Canada. We apply a grouped step-wise algorithm to iteratively select best-performing predictors of soil moisture. Integrated modeling approaches may better account for observed uncertainty and be tuned to different applications that vary in scale and scope, while also providing greater insights into spatial scaling (upscaling and downscaling) of soil moisture variability from the field- to regional scale. We discuss several methodological extensions and data requirements to enable further statistical modeling and validation for improved agricultural decision-support.

TI  - Cosmic ray neutrons provide an innovative technique for estimating intermediate scale soil moisture
VL  - 114
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important hydrological parameter, which is essential for a variety of applications, thereby extending to numerous disciplines. Currently, there are three methods of estimating soil moisture: ground-based (in-situ) measurements; remote sensing based methods and land surface models. In recent years, the cosmic ray probe (CRP), which is an in-situ technique, has been implemented in several countries across the globe. The CRP provides area-averaged soil moisture at an intermediate scale and thus bridges the gap between in-situ point measurements and global satellite-based soil moisture estimates. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of the CRP to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture. The CRP was set up and calibrated in Cathedral Peak Catchment VI. An in-situ soil moisture network consisting of time-domain reflectometry and Echo probes was created in Catchment VI, and was used to validate the CRP soil moisture estimates. Once calibrated, the CRP was found to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture, which correlated well with the in-situ soil moisture network data set and yielded an R2 value of 0.845. The use of the CRP for soil moisture monitoring provided reliable, accurate and continuous soil moisture estimates over the catchment area. The wealth of current and potential applications makes the CRP very appealing for scientists and engineers in various fields. Significance: The cosmic ray probe provides spatial estimates of surface soil moisture at an intermediate scale of 18 hectares. A single cosmic ray probe can replace a network of conventional in-situ instruments to provide reliable soil moisture estimates. The cosmic ray probe is capable of estimating soil moisture in previously problematic areas (saline soil, wetlands, rocky soil). Cosmic ray probes can provide data for hydro-meteorologists interested in land-atmosphere interactions. The cosmic ray probe estimates can be promising for remote sensing scientists for product calibration and validation. Â© 2018. The Author(s). Published under a Creative Commons Attribution Licence.

TI  - Participatory technology, policy and institutional development to address soil fertility degradation in {Africa
VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - At global scale nutrient flows are unbalanced, resulting in huge surpluses in Western Europe versus negative balances in Africa. Existing policy and socio-economic environments in different parts of the world are the major cause of this situation. At lower spatial scales, a much more complex and diverse picture emerges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, different levels and causes of soil fertility decline are found among agro-ecological zones, soil types, farm systems, wealth groups, urban-rural households, cash and food crops, home fields and bush fields. Technology development has been the traditional response to address nutrient imbalances in general, and soil fertility decline in Africa in particular. Farm households have continued to develop and adapt existing technology to changing situations. National and international research institutions have followed a variety of changing approaches of which the recently developed participatory approaches have yielded some impressive results in isolated cases. These efforts have, however, not led to the necessary massive reversion of the trend in soil fertility decline. The Dutch policies on nutrient use and the Indonesian policy to adopt Integrated Pest Management are two examples, associated with such major trend reversions. This suggests that promoting and supporting participatory technologies have limited impact when no attention is paid to participatory policy development and implementation. In order to mobilise farm households in a trend reversion, a number of conditions should be met such as stable prices for agricultural outputs, better input/output prices ratios, influence of land users on the research agenda and private-public initiatives focused on smallholders. This observation calls for the establishment of interactive landusers-science-policy triangles at various scales (local, national and international) in which joint learning and mediating may lead to more informed decision making, more focused design of an agricultural sector policy, implementation of policies by effective institutions, and appropriate technology development and implementation. Interventions need to be reoriented: less technology development, more policy influence and institution building. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toward {Global} {Soil} {Moisture} {Monitoring} with {Sentinel}-1: {Harnessing} {Assets} and {Overcoming} {Obstacles
VL  - 57
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to, e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. Here, we present a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites, which carry C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR) sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method, adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments. It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity. Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation is evident. The S-1 SSM is currently in preparation toward operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

SN  - NA
AB  - A field-scale remote soil moisture sensing technique that exploits polarization mode dispersion (PMD) associated with radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is considered in this paper. Microwave polarization responses from rough surface scattering are quantified using a dual-polarized receiver system to estimate PMD responses. Changes in PMD response are elicited by changes in the dielectric properties due to soil moisture changes. The ability of PMD characterizations to remotely detect changes in soil moisture, with responses that exhibit good correlation to ground probe measurements, is demonstrated using a prototype with widely separated transmitter/receiver system deployed at the MATERHORN field experiments conducted at the US Army Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture using optical/thermal infrared remote sensing in the {Canadian} {Prairies
VL  - 83
SN  - NA
AB  - A new approach to estimate soil moisture (SM) based on evaporative fraction (EF) retrieved from optical/thermal infrared MODIS data is presented for Canadian Prairies in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta. An EF model using the remotely sensed land surface temperature (Ts)/vegetation index concept was modified by incorporating North American Regional Reanalysis (NAAR) Ta data and used for SM estimation. Two different combinations of temperature and vegetation fraction using the difference between Ts from MODIS Aqua and Terra images and Ta from NARR data (Ts-Ta Aqua-day and Ts-Ta Terra-day, respectively) were proposed and the results were compared with those obtained from a previously improved model (Î´Ts Aqua-DayNight) as a reference. For the estimation of SM from EF, two empirical models were tested and discussed to find the most appropriate model for converting MODIS-derived EF data to SM values. Estimated SM values were then correlated with in situ SM measurements and their relationships were statistically analyzed. Results indicated statistically significant correlations between SM estimated from all three EF estimation approaches and field measured SM values (R2=0.42-0.77, p values{\textless}0.04) exhibiting the possibility to estimate SM from remotely sensed EF models. The proposed Ts-Ta MODIS Aqua-day and Terra-day approaches resulted in better estimations of SM (on average higher R2 values and similar RMSEs) as compared with the Î´Ts reference approach indicating that the concept of incorporating NARR Ta data into Ts/Vegetation index model improved soil moisture estimation accuracy based on evaporative fraction. The accuracies of the predictions were found to be considerably better for intermediate SM values (from 12 to 22vol/vol\%) with square errors averaging below 11 (vol/vol\%)2. This indicates that the model needs further improvements to account for extreme soil moisture conditions. The findings of this research can be potentially used to downscale SM estimations obtained from passive microwave remote sensing techniques.

AB  - In this work, we present are view of the results obtained in the exploitation of percolation theory and the renormalization group method in the study of soil moisture spatial patterns. In order to capture critical point in soil moisture spatio-temporal dynamics, we developed an algorithm consisting of three steps: (i) dichotomization, i.e., transforming the soil moisture maps into binary maps; (ii) identification of the largest wet cluster; (iii) scaling transformation, i.e., applying an ad hoc implemented coarse-graining procedure to the binary maps. The methodology was explored by means of several applications on soil moisture data coming from field measurement, remote sensing, and hydrological modelling over a wide range of spatial scales. From the relations between the occupation probability in soil moisture spatial patterns and the normalized size of the largest cluster at different scales, as well as the scaling behaviour, it is possible to argue that also for this physical system the critical point theory applies. The critical probability seems to be a structural feature of the catchment, being insensitive to the scale of the analysis, as well as to the parameterization of the methodology.

TI  - Landscape complexity and soil moisture variation in south {Georgia}, {USA}, for remote sensing applications
VL  - 357
SN  - NA
AB  - This research addressed the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture (SM) in a heterogeneous landscape. The research objective was to investigate soil moisture variation in eight homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots, similar to the pixel size of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) image. The plots were adjacent to eight stations of an in situ soil moisture network operated by the United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service USDA-ARS in Tifton, GA. We also studied five adjacent agricultural fields to examine the effect of different landuses/land covers (LULC) (grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil) on the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture. Soil moisture field data were collected on eight occasions throughout 2005 and January 2006 to establish comparisons within and among eight homogeneous plots. Consistently throughout time, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high variation in the soil moisture behavior among the plots and high homogeneity in the soil moisture behavior within them. A precipitation analysis for the eight sampling dates throughout the year 2005 showed similar rainfall conditions for the eight study plots. Therefore, soil moisture variation among locations was explained by in situ local conditions. Temporal stability geostatistical analysis showed that soil moisture has high temporal stability within the small plots and that a single point reading can be used to monitor soil moisture status for the plot within a maximum 3\% volume/volume (v/v) soil moisture variation. Similarly, t-statistic analysis showed that soil moisture status in the upper soil layer changes within 24 h. We found statistical differences in the soil moisture between the different LULC in the agricultural fields as well as statistical differences between these fields and the adjacent 30 by 30 m plots. From this analysis, it was demonstrated that spatial proximity is not enough to produce similar soil moisture, since t-test's among adjacent plots with different LULCs showed significant differences. These results confirm that a remote sensing approach that considers homogeneous LULC landscape fragments can be used to identify landscape units of similar soil moisture behavior under heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, the in situ USDA-ARS network will serve better in remote sensing studies in which sensors with fine spatial resolution are evaluated. This study is a first step towards identifying landscape units that can be monitored using the single point reading of the USDA-ARS stations network. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A novel low-cost open-hardware platform for monitoring soil water content and multiple soil-air-vegetation parameters
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision irrigation or phenotyping root traits for drought tolerance. The cost of instrumentation, however, limits measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to design a low cost â€•open hardwareâ€– platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 {\textless} 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.

TI  - A physically-based inversion algorithm for retrieving soil moisture in passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - 405
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture plays a key role in water and energy exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. Previous research on the microwave remote sensing of soil moisture focused mostly on the forward modeling problem. This paper presents a unique inversion algorithm (Hong's algorithm) for soil moisture retrieval with reduced degrees of freedom of the Fresnel equation; the algorithm is based on the characteristics of the polarization ratio for rough surfaces around the Brewster angle and Hong's approximation, which is an approximate relationship between vertically and horizontally polarized reflectivities. Using the daily observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) taken at 0.25Â°Ã—0.25Â°pixel, the soil moisture is estimated globally over the land surface using a relation between the complex dielectric constant and the soil moisture after retrieving the surface roughness and complex dielectric constant. The surface soil moisture products obtained from Hong's algorithm are validated using in situ observations carried out in Oklahoma and Georgia in 2003. The official AMSR-E soil moisture products are compared to assess Hong's algorithm using identical brightness temperature data sets. The biases and the root mean squared error calculated in comparison with the ground observations are in the range of -0.059m3/m3 to 0.01m3/m3 and 0.023m3/m3 to 0.065m3/m3, respectively. Hong's algorithm estimates the soil moisture within the estimated accuracy of AMSR-E surface soil moisture, 0.06m3/m3, without requiring a priori information about the roughness and the dielectric constants of the surface. With a minimal use of forward models, this research could also be applied to global soil moisture retrieval in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite mission and the Soil Moisture Active/Passive mission.

SN  - 1525-755X
AB  - In situ soil moisture measurements from 2007 to 2010 for 196 stations from five networks across the world (United States, France, Spain, China, and Australia) are used to determine the reliability of three soil moisture products: (i) a revised version of the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim; ERA-Land); (ii) a revised version of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis from NASA (MERRA-Land); and (iii) a new, microwave-based multisatellite surface soil moisture dataset (SM-MW). Evaluation of the time series and anomalies from a moving monthly mean shows a good performance of the three products in capturing the annual cycle of surface soil moisture and its short-term variability. On average, correlations (95\% confidence interval) are 0.66 (+/- 0.038), 0.69 (+/- 0.038), and 0.60 (+/- 0.061) for ERA-Land, MERRA-Land, and SM-MW. The two reanalysis products also capture the root-zone soil moisture well; on average, correlations are 0.68 (+/- 0.035) and 0.73 (+/- 0.032) for ERA-Land and MERRA-Land, respectively. Global trends analysis for 1988-2010 suggests a decrease of surface soil moisture contents (72\% of significant trends are negative, i.e., drying) for ERA-Land and an increase in surface soil moisture (59\% of significant trends are positive, i.e., wetting) for MERRA-Land. As the spatial extent and fractions of significant trends in both products differ, the trend reflected in the majority of grid points within different climate classes was investigated and compared to that of SM-MW. The latter is dominated by negative significant trends (73.2\%) and is more in line with ERA-Land. For both reanalysis products, trends for the upper layer of soil are confirmed in the root-zone soil moisture (first meter of soil).

TI  - Vis/{NIR} spectroscopic measurement of selected soil fertility parameters of {Cuban} agricultural {Cambisols
VL  - 125
SN  - NA
AB  - The conventional methods frequently used in Cuba to determine some fertility parameters important for sugarcane production, such as organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K2O), are difficult, costly, and time-consuming procedures. This study was undertaken to build and validate Visible/Near Infrared Reflectance (Vis/NIR) calibration models of these parameters at landscape level and within a field, by taking into consideration their correlation coefficients with the OM. The parameters P and K2O, which are not spectrally active in the Vis/NIR range should be better predicted when are highly correlated with OM. Also, the wavelength intervals to simplify this methodology were selected. Samples were air-dried before scanning using a diode array spectrophotometer covering the wavelength range from 399 to 1697nm. The regression models were built by using the linear multivariate regression method Partial Least Squares (PLS), and the nonlinear multivariate regression methods Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). At landscape level the best correlations between soil spectra and OM (0.90â‰¤R2â‰¤0.93; 0.12â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤0.14) were obtained with LWR, followed by K2O with LWR (0.77â‰¤R2â‰¤0.79; 3.47â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤3.62), Olsen P (0.69â‰¤R2â‰¤0.81; 0.27â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤0.35) and Oniani P (0.64â‰¤R2â‰¤0.65; 3.31â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤3.61) both with SVM. Also, the nonlinear regression models gave the best results within a field. The higher values for OM (R2=0.92; RMSEP=0.14) and Olsen P (0.68â‰¤R2â‰¤0.83; 0.27â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤0.34) were observed with SVM, while for K2O (0.16â‰¤R2â‰¤0.63; 5.13â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤5.88), and Oniani P (0.70â‰¤R2â‰¤0.72; 2.32â‰¤RMSEPâ‰¤2.52) were obtained with LWR. The soil fertility parameters studied at landscape level and within a field were best estimated by using nonlinear regression models. Â© 2014 IAgrE.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of the measurement errors of soil water content due to interference of two adjacent {TDR} probes
VL  - 30
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of this experimental study was to determine the measurement errors caused by the interference effects when two TDR probes operate nearby in various distance apart for different soil types and soil water contents. The results will help to guide the design of an experimental apparatus which aims to study the coupled heat and moisture transfer in soils at high temperatures of higher than 40Â°C with the highest possible spatial resolution. The interference effect between two adjacent time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes has been evaluated and analyzed experimentally. It was observed that the distance between the probes, soil texture, and the water content of the testing soil is the key parameters which affect the interference and TDR probe capability of measurement. In this study, three types of soils were examined, namely FSJ\#1 (silty clay), Matilda (loamy sand), and Ottawa sand C-190 (quartz sand). Three different volumetric water contents were evaluated for each soil. The interference effect was noticeable in all soil samples when the distances between the probes were 1 cm. For the samples with higher moisture content, the effect of interference on the TDRsâ€™ electromagnetic waveform signals is more prominent. Interference was found in Matilda samples with degrees of saturations of 0.5 and higher even though the distances between the probes were greater than 1 cm; nevertheless, the determination of volumetric water content was not affected by the interference, because the interference only caused the two TDRsâ€™ electromagnetic waveform signals to shift by the same length. No interference was observed in cases of FSJ\#1 and Ottawa sand when the distances between the probes were greater than 1 cm. From the results, it was found that the sensitivity zone of our TDR equipment is a radius of about 10 mm surrounding the central needle of the TDR probe. In case of FSJ\#1, when interference occurs, the measurement error of water content significantly increases from 9.3\% to 15.5\%, corresponding to the degree of saturation from 0.25 to 1.0.

TI  - Evaluation of the {Performance} of {TDR} and {Capacitance} {Techniques} for {Soil} {Moisture} {Measurement
VL  - 41
SN  - 0149-6115
AB  - Though researchers have employed various techniques (gravimetric, electromagnetic, neutron scattering, heat pulse, microwave, and optical remote sensing techniques) for soil moisture measurement, dielectric-based techniques (Time Domain Reflectometry [TDR] and capacitance technique [CT]) have gained much more popularity, mainly due to revolutionary developments in the fields of electronics and data communication systems. However, the suitability and relative performance of these techniques for moisture measurement of soils is a point of debate. Hence, in order to address this issue, extensive studies were conducted on soils of entirely different characteristics, compacted at various compaction states (dry densities and water contents) by employing TDR and capacitance probes. Subsequently, the dielectric constant of the soil and its bulk electrical conductivity were obtained using these probes and compared against each other and those computed from Topp's equation, which is a well-established relationship between the dielectric constant of the soil and its volumetric moisture content. An attempt was also made to correlate Ka values obtained from the dielectric techniques and Topp's equation with those of the Time Propagation (TP) Mixing model, which incorporates the properties of the soil matrix as well. It has been observed that the Ka-TDR matches well with the Ka-Topp and Ka-TP, while the best match has been observed between Ka-TDR and Ka-Topp as compared to the Ka-CT. As such, the study demonstrates clearly that Topp's equation, which ignores the soil-specific parameters, is capable of determining the soil moisture content appropriately. This study proposes an empirical equation that relates dielectric constants obtained from Topp's equation to those obtained from TDR, CT, and the TP Mixing model. Such a relationship can be further utilized for estimating the volumetric soil moisture content.

TI  - Multi-sensor land data assimilation: {Toward} a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation
VL  - 216
SN  - NA
AB  - Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003â€“2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.

TI  - Automatic fault detection in a low cost frequency domain (capacitance based) soil moisture sensor
VL  - 183
SN  - NA
AB  - Frequency Domain Analysis can be used to determine the moisture content of soils. At least two techniques can be used, the first using the soil capacitance as part of a low pass filter, measuring the attenuation of a fixed frequency signal, the second using the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency oscillator. Whilst the two techniques demonstrate differing sensitivities to different conditions, they demonstrate an acceptably stable reciprocal relationship to each other over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. With insulated probes, it is possible under field conditions for these probes to be damaged or for moisture to creep into the electronics housing. Either of these conditions make the soil capacitor appear to â€˜leakâ€™ by providing a lower electrically resistive path in parallel with the soil capacitance. This resistance affects the measurements of the two techniques described above in different ways and thus readings from the sensors diverge from their normal relationships. These variations are measureable and thus the fault condition can be automatically detected. This can be used to flag potential problems in the soil moisture measurements raising an alarm condition, or stopping unnecessary irrigation based on erroneous results from a damaged sensor. This paper presents results demonstrating these phenomena using a Frequency Domain capacitance based sensor costing less than 10 Euros. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Frequency, electrical conductivity and temperature analysis of a low-cost capacitance soil moisture sensor
VL  - 352
SN  - NA
AB  - This study evaluated the family of ECH2O sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) for measurement of soil moisture content (Î¸), bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) and temperature for a range of soils, across a range of measurement frequencies between 5 and 150 MHz. Measurement frequency is one of the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to soil variables such as soil texture, electrical conductivity, and temperature. Measurements in both soil and solution demonstrated that the ECH2O EC and TE measurements were accurate. Using a measurement frequency of 70 MHz, a single calibration curve was determined for a range of mineral soils, independent of soil salinity, suggesting there might be no need for a soil specific calibration. When combining all data for each soil type, the R2 values remained high (R2 = 0.98) with little probe to probe variability. After laboratory calibration, the error for Î¸ was about 2\%, independent of soil ECb, up to a soil solution EC of about 12 dS/m. Our results showed that a single calibration curve could be used for all tested mineral soils, independent of soil salinity. The bulk soil ECb - water content data were excellently described by a polynomial expression. Measurements of temperature sensitivity to soil water content and ECb were sufficiently small. For example, for a temperature change of 10 Â°C, measurements of Î¸ and ECb were affected by about 0.02 cm3 cm-3 and 0.02 dS/m, respectively. Limited sensor calibration requirements are important, when large networks of soil moisture sensors are being deployed. It is concluded that an accurate, cost-effective soil moisture sensor is available that operates at a measurement frequency of 70 MHz, with a low sensitivity to confounding soil environmental factors.

VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - The effects of drip fertigation of NPK and vermicompost extract (VCE) on soil fertility status of arecanut-only and arecanut-cocoa systems were assessed in a 4-year field study. In arecanut, soil pH was reduced over initial levels. At 0â€“30 cm deep, fertigation of 75 percent NPK to arecanut only and organic-matter recycling in arecanut + cocoa maintained significantly greater soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil-test phosphorus (P). At the first depth, soil potassium (K) was significantly greater with 75 percent NPK (246 mg kg-1) than other treatments. In cocoa, soil pH varied significantly due to fertigation at both depths. The SOC was reduced due to 75 percent NPK at the first depth. In cocoa, the P availability increased significantly with application of VCE at 20 percent N. Fertigation of 75 percent NPK maintained significantly greater soil K and soil Mg than other treatments. The results suggest that drip fertigation of NPK sustains the soil fertility status in arecanut and cocoa. Â© Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 74
SN  - NA
AB  - In this study, the microclimate changes in silvopastoral systems are quantified at different time and spatial scales and compared with single-pasture systems. The study was conducted in a silvopastoral system in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil (22Â°01' South and 47Â°53' West). The silvopastoral system consisted of grass pastures [Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) decumbens cv. Basilik] lined with strips of native trees spaced at 17 m. Continuous microclimate measurements (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and incident photosynthetically active radiation) were carried out from September 2010 to September 2012 at two positions of the silvopastoral system (2.0 and 8.5 m from the rows of trees) and at a pasture under full sunlight, located in an adjacent area. The soil moisture was monitored weekly from 24 March 2010 to 1 April 2012 at distances of 0.0, 2.0, 4.75, and 8.5 m from the rows of trees. The rows of native trees reduced wind speeds (46\% reduction) and changed the photosynthetically active radiation incidence pattern on the pasture (up to 40\% reduction of incidence at the point nearest to the trees). The combined action of these factors promoted thermal and air humidity changes on the pasture at the different points measured. With respect to soil moisture, there was greater soil moisture removal at the sampling points near the rows of native trees under the silvopastoral system, mainly due to enhanced exploration by tree roots at greater depths in dry spells or early dry periods, when compared with the midpoints between the rows.

TI  - Characterization of the soil fertility and root system of restinga forests; [caracterizaÃ§Ã£o da fertilidade do solo e sistema radicular de floresta de restinga]
VL  - 36
SN  - NA
AB  - The Restinga vegetation consists of a mosaic of plant communities, which are defined by the characteristics of the substrates, resulting from the type and age of the depositional processes. This mosaic complex of vegetation types comprises restinga forest in advanced (high restinga) and medium regeneration stages (low restinga), each with particular differentiating vegetation characteristics. The climate along the coast is tropical (KÃ¶ppen). Of all ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest, Restinga is the most fragile and susceptible to anthropic disturbances. Plants respond to soil characteristics with physiological and morphological modifications, resulting in changes in the architecture (spatial configuration) of the root system. The purpose of this study was to characterize the soil fertility of high and low restinga forests, by chemical and physical parameters, and its relation to the root system distribution in the soil profile. Four locations were studied: (1) Ilha Anchieta State Park, Ubatuba; (2) two Ecological Stations of Jureia-Itatins and of ChauÃ¡s, in the municipality of Iguape; (3) Vila de Pedrinhas in the municipality of Ilha Comprida; and (4) Ilha do Cardoso State Park, Cananeia. The soil fertility (chemical and physical properties) was analyzed in the layers 0-5, 0-10, 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm. In addition, the distribution of the root system in the soil profile was evaluated, using digital images and the Spring program. It was concluded that the root system of all vegetation types studied is restricted to the surface layers, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, but occupies mainly the 0-10 cm layer (70\%); that soil fertility is low in all environments studied, with base saturation values below 16\%, since most exchange sites are occupied by aluminum; and that restinga vegetation is edaphic.

TI  - ELBARA} {II}, an {L}-band radiometer system for soil moisture research
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - L-band (1-2 GHz) microwave radiometry is a remote sensing technique that can be used to monitor soil moisture, and is deployed in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). Performing ground-based radiometer campaigns before launch, during the commissioning phase and during the operative SMOS mission is important for validating the satellite data and for the further improvement of the radiative transfer models used in the soil-moisture retrieval algorithms. To address these needs, three identical L-band radiometer systems were ordered by ESA. They rely on the proven architecture of the ETH L-Band radiometer for soil moisture research (ELBARA) with major improvements in the microwave electronics, the internal calibration sources, the data acquisition, the user interface, and the mechanics. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of the instruments and the main characteristics that are relevant for the user. Â© 2010 by the authors.

TI  - Monitoring soil water content and deficit using {Electrical} {Resistivity} {Tomography} ({ERT}) - {A} case study in the {Cevennes} area, {France
VL  - 380
SN  - NA
AB  - At the hillslope scale, surface runoff depends to a great extent on the water deficit of the soils, i.e. the difference between the effective porosity and the water content, all through the soil profile. The aim of this study was to assess water deficits using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). ERT offers several advantages: (i) it is not intrusive, (ii) it exhibits spatial patterns at a decametric or hectometric scale, and (iii) it provides information on both water content and soil depth. The study was conducted on a Mediterranean shaley sandy soil, in the Cevennes (South of France). First, the factors (nature of the pores and organization of the material, water content, soil solution and temperature) on which electrical resistivities depend were analyzed in the laboratory. Soil samples were used to derive the 'm' and 'n' parameters of Archie's relation, changes in the soil solution over time, and the effect of temperature on resistivities. These results were then used to interpret ERT in situ at different times of the year. The water content and water deficit obtained from ERT were then compared with local measurements made using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and the comparison was satisfactory. The results of this study show the potential of measuring soil water content and water deficit using electrical resistivities, and describe how uncertainties in temperature, porosity, and fluid conductivity impact ERT-obtained estimates of soil water content and deficit.

TI  - Soil moisture limitations on monitoring boreal forest regrowth using spaceborne {L}-band {SAR} data
VL  - 115
SN  - NA
AB  - A study was carried out to investigate the utility of L-band SAR data for estimating aboveground biomass in sites with low levels of vegetation regrowth. Data to estimate biomass were collected from 59 sites located in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in interior Alaska. PALSAR L-band data (HH and HV polarizations) collected on two dates in the summer/fall of 2007 and one date in the summer of 2009 were used. Significant linear correlations were found between the log of aboveground biomass (range of 0.02 to 22.2tha-1) and ÏƒÂ° (L-HH) and ÏƒÂ° (L-HV) for the data collected on each of the three dates, with the highest correlation found using the L-HV data collected when soil moisture was highest. Soil moisture, however, did change the correlations between L-band ÏƒÂ° and aboveground biomass, and the analyses suggest that the influence of soil moisture is biomass dependent. The results indicate that to use L-band SAR data for mapping aboveground biomass and monitoring forest regrowth will require development of approaches to account for the influence that variations in soil moisture have on L-band microwave backscatter, which can be particularly strong when low levels of aboveground biomass occur.

TI  - L-band remote-sensing increases sampled levels of global soil moisture-air temperature coupling strength
VL  - 220
SN  - NA
AB  - Due to their shallow penetration of the soil column, remote-sensing (RS) soil moisture retrievals are often considered ill-suited for measuring the strength of soil moisture-air temperature coupling. Consequently, soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates, C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at p = 0.05 [-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However, 2010â€“2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case. Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015â€“2018 soil moisture products from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled correlations than SPI over global hot-spot regions (significant at p = 0.05 [-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify land-atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling. Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of soil water content profiles in an irrigated field using probabilistic inversion of time-lapse {EMI} data
VL  - 110
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring spatiotemporal variations of soil water content (Î¸) is important across a range of research fields, including agricultural engineering, hydrology, meteorology and climatology. Low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems have proven to be useful tools in mapping soil apparent electrical conductivity (Ïƒa) and soil moisture. However, obtaining depth profile water content is an area that has not been fully explored using EMI. To examine this, we performed time-lapse EMI measurements using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor along a 10 m transect of a maize field over a 6 day period. Reference data were measured at the end of the profile via an excavated pit using 5TE capacitance sensors. In order to derive a time-lapse, depth-specific subsurface image of electrical conductivity (Ïƒ), we applied a probabilistic sampling approach, DREAM(ZS), on the measured EMI data. The inversely estimated Ïƒ values were subsequently converted to Î¸ using the Rhoades et al. (1976) petrophysical relationship. The uncertainties in measured Ïƒa, as well as inaccuracies in the inverted data, introduced some discrepancies between estimated Ïƒ and reference values in time and space. Moreover, the disparity between the measurement footprints of the 5TE and CMD Mini-Explorer sensors also led to differences. The obtained Î¸ permitted an accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of soil water content due to root water uptake and evaporation. The proposed EMI measurement and modeling technique also allowed for detecting temporal root zone soil moisture variations. The time-lapse Î¸ monitoring approach developed using DREAM(ZS) thus appears to be a useful technique to understand spatiotemporal patterns of soil water content and provide insights into linked soil moisture vegetation processes and the dynamics of soil moisture/infiltration processes.

VL  - 1
SN  - 2072-4292
AB  - This study addresses the issue of the variability and heterogeneity problems that are expected from a sensor with a larger footprint having homogenous and heterogeneous sub-pixels. Improved understanding of spatial variability of soil surface characteristics such as land cover and vegetation in larger footprint are critical in remote sensing based soil moisture retrieval. This study analyzes the sub-pixel variability (standard deviation of sub-grid pixels) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and SAR backscatter. Back-propagation neural network was used for soil moisture retrieval from active microwave remote sensing data from Southern Great Plains of Oklahoma. The effect of land cover heterogeneity (number of different vegetation species within pixels) on soil moisture retrieval using active microwave remote sensing data was investigated. The presence of heterogeneous vegetation cover reduced the accuracy of the derived soil moisture using microwave remote sensing data. The results from this study can be used to characterize the uncertainty in soil moisture retrieval in the context of Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission which will have larger footprint.

VL  - 301
SN  - NA
AB  - Knowledge of ground wave penetration depth and methods for facilitating ground wave velocity analysis are important practical aspects to consider when measuring soil water content with surface ground penetrating radar. A field study was conducted to optimize the wide angle reflection and refraction and fixed offset methods of measuring the ground wave velocity and to find the effective ground wave sampling depth under irrigation and drainage conditions. In this study, a PulseEkko 1000 GPR system with 450 MHz antennas was used at a sandy loam soil site. Water contents measured with time domain reflectometry (TDR) were used to determine the sampling depth of GPR based water content estimates. Cumulative irrigation and drainage calculated with GPR were found to be more closely related with cumulative irrigation and drainage measured with shorter TDR probes, suggesting that the ground wave sampling depth was in the 0.2-0.5 m range. During the infiltration phase the depth of the ground wave penetration was found to be in the 0-0.56 m range, assuming a sharp boundary between wet and dry sand. Comparison of water contents measured with the WARR and FO methods revealed that an antenna separation distance of 1.5-2.0 m for the FO method was required to obtain similar results between the two methods.

VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Thermal remote sensing of soil moisture in vineyards is a challenge. The grass-covered soil, in addition to a standing grape canopy, create complex patterns of heating and cooling and increase the surface temperature variability between vine rows. In this study, we evaluate the strength of relationships between soil moisture, mechanical resistance and thermal inertia calculated from the drop of surface temperature during a clear sky night over a vineyard in the Niagara region. We utilized data from two sensors, an airborne thermal camera (height approximate to 500 m a.g.l.) and a handheld thermal gun (height approximate to 1 m a.g.l.), to explore the effects of different field of views and the high inter-row temperature variability. Spatial patterns of soil moisture correlated more with estimated thermal inertia than with surface temperature recorded at sunrise or sunset. Despite the coarse resolution of airborne thermal inertia images, it performed better than estimates from the handheld thermal gun. Between-row variation was further analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Despite the limited spatial variability of soil properties within a single vineyard, the magnitudes of the model coefficients for soil moisture and mechanical resistance are encouraging indicators of the utility of thermal inertia in vineyard management.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Global soil moisture (SM) products are currently available thanks to microwave remote sensing techniques. Validation of these satellite-based SM products over different vegetation and climate conditions is a crucial step. INRA (National Institute of Agricultural Research) has set up the AQUI SM and soil temperature in situ network (composed of three main sites Bouron, Bilos, and Hermitage), over a flat area of dense pine forests, in South-Western France (the Bordeaux-Aquitaine region) to validate the Soil Moisture and Ocean salinity (SMOS) satellite SM products. SMOS was launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (ESA). The aims of this study are to present the AQUI network and to evaluate the SMOS SM product (in the new SMOS-IC version) along with other microwave SM products such as the active ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and the ESA combined (passive and active) CCI (Climate Change Initiative) SM retrievals. A first comparison, using Pearson correlation, Bias, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and Un biased RMSE (ubRMSE) scores, between the 0-5 cm AQUI network and ASCAT, CCI, and SMOS SM products was conducted. In general all the three products were able to reproduce the annual cycle of the AQUI in situ observations. CCI and ASCAT had best and similar correlations (R similar to 0.72) over the Bouron and Bilos sites. All had comparable correlations over the Hermitage sites with overall average values of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.69 for CCI, SMOS-IC, and ASCAT, respectively. Considering anomalies, correlation values decreased for all products with best ability to capture day to day variations obtained by ASCAT. CCI (followed by SMOS-IC) had the best ubRMSE values (mostly {\textless} 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) over most of the stations. Although the region is highly impacted by radio frequency interferences, SMOS-IC followed correctly the in situ SM dynamics. All the three remotely-sensed SM products (except SMOS-IC over some stations) overestimated the AQUI in situ SM observations. These results demonstrate that the AQUI network is likely to be well-suited for satellite microwave remote sensing evaluations/validations.

TI  - Upscaling of sparse \textit{in situ} soil moisture observations by integrating auxiliary information from remote sensing
VL  - 38
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Upscaling of sparse in situ soil moisture (SM) observations is essential for the validation of current and upcoming space-borne SM retrievals, and the successful application of SM observations in hydrological models or data assimilation. In this study, we construct a novel method based on Bayesian data fusion to up scale in situ SM observations to the coarse scale of microwave remote sensing. In the framework of Bayesian theory, the valuable auxiliary information obtained in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) apparent thermal inertia (ATI) is integrated into the upscaling process. The method is validated using SM wireless sensor network data in the Tibetan plateau, which covers an area of approximately 30 x 30 km(2) with 20 in situ stations. Results confirm that the upscaled SM using the method with randomly selected three stations from the 20 stations is extremely close to the mean of the 20 SMs. The mean root mean square error (RMSE) between the upscaled SM and the mean of the 20 in situ SMs was 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and the max RMSE was less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3). Furthermore, the sensitivity of the upscaling accuracy to the number of in situ observations is discussed. When the number of in situ observations is greater than nine, the increasing accuracy of the Bayesian method is limited by the uncertainty in the ATI of the remote sensing.

VL  - 5
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Monitoring the amount of moisture held in the soil is critical in the management of risk for the agriculture sector. Extremes in soil moisture can lead to devastating consequences. Early assessment of soil moisture reserves, and monitoring of changes in available soil moisture, could assist in risk reduction strategies for the agriculture sector and effective delivery of government programs. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been acquiring RADARSAT-2 data since 2008 to evaluate the accuracy with which this sensor can provide soil moisture to assist with implementing risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture sector. The calibrated Integral Equation Model (IEM) was used to estimate soil moisture for 15 RADARSAT-2 data sets acquired over an eastern and western Canadian test site. Using this approach, field level soil moisture was estimated to a mean average error of 7.95\%, although considerable scatter in the results was observed. Removing fields which had significant residue cover improved site specific soil moisture errors, but only for the fall campaign prior to spring tillage and seed bed preparation. Higher errors were also observed for data sets where angles between the RADARSAT-2 look direction and field tillage structures were largest. When soil moisture estimates were evaluated at a regional scale, mean errors fell to 3.14\%. The IEM was also able to detect increases and decreases in soil moisture which followed periods of rainfall and drying.

VL  - 212
SN  - NA
AB  - In this study, an integration of microwave data obtained from the SMAP and AMSR2 satellite radiometers has been attempted, to achieve an accurate estimation of the Soil Moisture Content (SMC). This research aimed to overcome the failure of radar sensor in SMAP satellite as well as the failure to generate the radar/radiometer combined SMC product at a spatial resolution of 9 km Ã— 9 km. A disaggregation technique, based on the Smoothing Filter based Intensity Modulation (SFIM), enabled us to obtain co-located SMAP and AMSR2 brightness measurements at L, C, X, Ku and Ka bands at approximately 10 km Ã— 10 km on the selected test area, which corresponds to the entire Italian territory. These disaggregated microwave data were used as inputs of the â€œHydroAlgoâ€ retrieval algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which were able to exploit the synergy between radiometric acquisitions from these two sensors. The algorithm was defined, implemented and tested using all the overlapping orbits of SMAP and AMSR2 over Italy throughout the 9\_month period between April and December 2015. Distributed SMC reference values for implementing and validating the algorithm were obtained from the Soil Water Balance hydrological model, SWBM. Through HydroAlgo, an SMC product at a resolution of approximately 10 km Ã— 10 km was obtained. This result is close to the original Radar/Radiometer SMC product from SMAP, with an average correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.75 and RMSE â‰… 0.03 m3/m3, in both ascending and descending orbits.

TI  - Ground and surface temperature variability for remote sensing of soil moisture in a heterogeneous landscape
VL  - 368
SN  - NA
AB  - At the Little River Watershed (LRW) heterogeneous landscape near Tifton Georgia US an in situ network of stations operated by the US Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service-Southeast Watershed Research Lab (USDA-ARS-SEWRL) was established in 2003 for the long term study of climatic and soil biophysical processes. To develop an accurate interpolation of the in situ readings that can be used to produce distributed representations of soil moisture (SM) and energy balances at the landscape scale for remote sensing studies, we studied (1) the temporal and spatial variations of ground temperature (GT) and infra red temperature (IRT) within 30 by 30 m plots around selected network stations; (2) the relationship between the readings from the eight 30 by 30 m plots and the point reading of the network stations for the variables SM, GT and IRT; and (3) the spatial and temporal variation of GT and IRT within agriculture landuses: grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil in the surrounding landscape. The results showed high correlations between the station readings and the adjacent 30 by 30 m plot average value for SM; high seasonal independent variation in the GT and IRT behavior among the eight 30 by 30 m plots; and site specific, in-field homogeneity in each 30 by 30 m plot. We found statistical differences in the GT and IRT between the different landuses as well as high correlations between GT and IRT regardless of the landuse. Greater standard deviations for IRT than for GT (in the range of 2-4) were found within the 30 by 30 m, suggesting that when a single point reading for this variable is selected for the validation of either remote sensing data or water-energy models, errors may occur. The results confirmed that in this landscape homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots can be used as landscape spatial units for soil moisture and ground temperature studies. Under this landscape conditions small plots can account for local expressions of environmental processes, decreasing the errors and uncertainties in remote sensing estimates caused by landscape heterogeneity.

TI  - Combining {UAV}-based hyperspectral imagery and machine learning algorithms for soil moisture content monitoring.
VL  - 7
SN  - 2167-8359
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important factor that affects agricultural development in arid regions. Compared with the space-borne remote sensing system,  the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used because of its stronger  controllability and higher resolution. It also provides a more convenient method  for monitoring SMC than normal measurement methods that includes field sampling  and oven-drying techniques. However, research based on UAV hyperspectral data has  not yet formed a standard procedure in arid regions. Therefore, a universal  processing scheme is required. We hypothesized that combining pretreatments of  UAV hyperspectral imagery under optimal indices and a set of field observations  within a machine learning framework will yield a highly accurate estimate of SMC.  Optimal 2D spectral indices act as indispensable variables and allow us to  characterize a model's SMC performance and spatial distribution. For this  purpose, we used hyperspectral imagery and a total of 70 topsoil samples (0-10  cm) from the farmland (2.5 Ã— 10(4) m(2)) of Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur  AutonomousRegion, China. The random forest (RF) method and extreme learning  machine (ELM) were used to estimate the SMC using six methods of pretreatments  combined with four optimal spectral indices. The validation accuracy of the  estimated method clearly increased compared with that of linear models. The  combination of pretreatments and indices by our assessment effectively eliminated  the interference and the noises. Comparing two machine learning algorithms showed  that the RF models were superior to the ELM models, and the best model was PIR (R  (2) (val) = 0.907, RMSEP = 1.477, and RPD = 3.396). The SMC map predicted via the  best scheme was highly similar to the SMC map measured. We conclude that  combining preprocessed spectral indices and machine learning algorithms allows  estimation of SMC with high accuracy (R (2) (val) = 0.907) via UAV hyperspectral  imagery on a regional scale. Ultimately, our program might improve management and  conservation strategies for agroecosystem systems in arid regions.

TI  - Evaluating the {Utility} of {Remotely} {Sensed} {Soil} {Moisture} {Retrievals} for {Operational} {Agricultural} {Drought} {Monitoring
VL  - 3
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Soil moisture is a fundamental data source used by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) to monitor crop growth stage and condition and subsequently, globally forecast agricultural yields. Currently, the USDA IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent between 23Â° N-50Â° N and 128Â° W-65Â° W. In particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.

TI  - Estimation of the root-zone soil moisture using passive microwave remote sensing and {SMAR} model
VL  - 143
SN  - NA
AB  - Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) at regional scales is a critical issue in surface hydrology that could be a great help for estimating evapotranspiration, erosion, runoff, and irrigation requirements, etc. A significant number of satellites [soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS), special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I), advanced microwave scanning radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), tropical rainfall measuring mission/microwave imager (TRMM/TMI), etc.] retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) using passive microwave remote sensing. This information can be used to derive RZSM using a new mathematical filter. In particular, the recently developed soil moisture analytical relationship (SMAR) can relate the surface soil moisture to the moisture of deeper layer using a relationship derived from a soil water balance equation where infiltration is estimated based on the relative fluctuations of soil moisture in the surface soil layer. In the present paper, the SMAR model is tested on two research databases in Africa and North America [African monsoon multidisciplinary analysis (AMMA) and soil climate analysis network (SCAN), respectively], where field measurements at different depths are available. Furthermore, the TRMM/TMI Satellite is selected to retrieve the satellite SSM data of the studied regions using the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Both remotely sensed SSM and field measurements are used within the SMAR model to explore their ability in reproducing the RZSM and also to explore the existing difference in model parameterization moving from one dataset to the other. The SMAR model is applied using three different schemes: (1) with parameters calibrated using surface field measurements, (2) with parameters calibrated using remotely sensed SSM as input, and finally (3) using the remotely sensed SSM with the same parameters calibrated in Scheme 1. In all cases, SMAR parameters have been calibrated using a genetic algorithm optimizing the root-mean square error (RMSE) between SMAR prediction and measured RZSM. The results show that remotely sensed data may be coupled with the SMAR model to provide a good description of RZSM dynamics, but it requires a specific parameterization respect to Scheme 1. Nevertheless, it is surprising to observe that two of the four parameters of the model related to the soil texture are relatively stable moving from remote-sensed to field data.

TI  - Monitoring multi-decadal satellite earth observation of soil moisture products through land surface reanalyses
VL  - 138
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture from ERA-Land, a revised version of the land surface components of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), is used to monitor at a global scale the consistency of a new microwave based multi-satellite surface soil moisture date set (SM-MW) over multi-decadal time period (1980-2010). ERA-Land results from Land Surface Model simulations forced by high quality atmospheric forcing data. It was shown to adequately capture the temporal dynamic of soil moisture. ERA-Land's large scale nature, frozen configuration, global availability and ability to accurately represent soil moisture variability make it suitable to complement typical validation approaches of soil moisture from remote sensing based on ground measurements. Considering locations that have significant correlations for each 3-year sub periods within 1980-2010, averaged soil moisture correlations of SM-MW with ERA-Land (at 95\% Confidence Interval) are increasing steadily from 1986 to 2010 (from 0.52. Â±. 0.10, to 0.66. Â±. 0.04). The lower correlations mirror the periods where only passive microwave from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image (SSM/I, Ku band at 19.3. GHz) sensor was used, highlighting the importance of multi-sensor capabilities. Overall SM-MW is relatively stable over time with respect to ERA-Land. Good agreement is obtained in semi-arid areas, whilst the tropics and high latitudes (and altitudes) present lower correlations values. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture patterns with remote sensing and terrain data at the small catchment scale
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment characteristics (e.g., terrain and land use) that can be used as proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture database for the SchÃ¤fertal catchment, located in central Germany, was used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58\% of the cases and was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale.

TI  - Principle and applicability of cosmic-ray neutron method for measuring soil moisture
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Regional soil moisture monitoring has always been a difficult point in many researches. The traditional point measurement and the large scale remote sensing monitoring are always unable to obtain information of medium and small scale regional soil moisture. As a new type of mesoscale soil moisture condition monitoring method, the cosmic ray neutron method can obtain the soil moisture information within 300 m radius of the source region, which covers the shortage of the point measuring method and remote sensing method. This study utilized cosmic ray neutron instrument (CRS) to constantly monitor soil moisture, and conducted the applicability research of cosmic ray neutron method in soil moisture monitoring. Results show high consistency of CRS and time domain reflectometer (TDR) measurements, the fitting degree is 0.847, the root mean square error is 0.020 kg/kg. Also, CRS is sensitive to precipitation, it can clearly show the increase of soil moisture under different conditions, while the sensitivity of TDR is relatively poor. This research can provide a reference for dynamic change monitoring of regional mesoscale soil moisture. Â© 2018, ALÃ–KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

VL  - 49
SN  - 1006-9313
AB  - In order to improve accuracy of soil moisture inversion using remote sensing, a new thermal inertia model is proposed in this paper. The improved model needs only surface maximum temperature as the temperature parameter input instead of input of the surface temperature difference, as well as the surface sensible and latent fluxes are introduced into boundary conditions of thermal conductivity equation. Furthermore, surface soil conductive heat transfer equation of two-layer model is used to solve the soil thermal inertia so that the remote sensing thermal inertia method can be applied to regions with better-covered vegetation, but usually only for the bare areas or worse vegetation covered areas. The model has been tested at several locations in the area of west Inner Mongolia. Comparing the simulation of the new model with the measurements obtained by apparent thermal inertia and by field test, the result shows that the inertia thermal model can be used to estimate soil moisture in more reasonable accuracy.

VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - The enormous increase of remote sensing data from airborne and space-borne platforms, as well as ground measurements has directed the attention of scientists towards new and efficient retrieval methodologies. Of particular importance is the consideration of the large extent and the high dimensionality (spectral, temporal and spatial) of remote sensing data. Moreover, the launch of the Sentinel satellite family will increase the availability of data, especially in the temporal domain, at no cost to the users. To analyze these data and to extract relevant features, such as essential climate variables (ECV), specific methodologies need to be exploited. Among these, greater attention is devoted to machine learning methods due to their flexibility and the capability to process large number of inputs and to handle non-linear problems. The main objective of this paper is to provide a review of research that is being carried out to retrieve two critically important terrestrial biophysical quantities (vegetation biomass and soil moisture) from remote sensing data using machine learning methods.

TI  - A soil moisture estimation method using actively heated fiber {Bragg} grating sensors
VL  - 242
SN  - 0013-7952
AB  - Although many methods of soil moisture measurement exist, there remains a lack of soil moisture sensor with small volume, high precision, excellent real-time performance and distributed monitoring capability. In this paper, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based carbon fiber heated sensor (CFHS) that can overcome the deficiencies in soil moisture movement is proposed. The CFHS consists of a carbon fiber rod with a diameter of 5 mm, quas-distributed FBG sensors on an optical fiber, a coating, two binding posts, and two electric cables. Laboratory calibration tests have been conducted to establish an empirical piece-wise relationship between the temperature characteristic value and soil moisture for sand, silt and clay. A laboratory validation test under normal gravity and a centrifuge test under overweight conditions, have been performed to verify the feasibility of this technique for soil moisture monitoring. The test results show that the CFHS can (i) accurately record soil moisture under normal gravitational and overweight conditions and (ii) track the evolution of capillary zones, and the generation and migration of moisture transition zones under centrifuge acceleration. During a response period of 5 min, the accuracy is 0.033m(3)/m(3) under 1 g condition, and 0.047m(3)/m(3) under overweight condition. With the advantages of small sensor size, low disturbance of soil mass and wide adaptability in physical model tests, the proposed method can achieve distributed soil moisture measurement at different scales and with high efficiency.

TI  - Continuous field soil moisture content mapping by means of apparent electrical conductivity ({ECa}) measurement
VL  - 61
SN  - NA
AB  - A soil moisture content map is important for providing information about the distribution of moisture in a given area. Moisture content directly influences agricultural yield thus it is crucial to have accurate and reliable information about moisture distribution and content in the field. Since soil is a porous medium modified generalized Archie's equation provides the basic formula to calculate moisture content data based on measured ECa. In this study we aimed to find a more accurate and cost effective method for measuring moisture content than manual field sampling. Locations of 25 sampling points were chosen from our research field as a reference. We assumed that soil moisture content could be calculated by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) using the Veris-3100 on-the-go soil mapping tool. Statistical analysis was carried out on the 10.791 ECa raw data in order to filter the outliers. The applied statistical method was Â±1.5 interquartile (IRQ) distance approach. The visualization of soil moisture distribution within the experimental field was carried out by means of ArcGIS/ArcMAP using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method. In the investigated 25 sampling points, coefficient of determination between calculated volumetric moisture content data and measured ECa was R2 = 0.87. According to our results, volumetric moisture content can be mapped by applying ECa measurements in these particular soil types.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of nitrogen-fertilization management on soil nutrient distribution at different soil depths under conventional tillage in dryland rain-fed environment. Two nitrogen (N) application methods (single application with all N applied at planting and split application with 35 kg N ha-1 applied at planting and remaining N applied at V6 growth stage) and five N rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N ha-1) were utilized. Increasing soil depth decreased extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) contents in the soil. The nitrate (NO3)-N concentration in deeper soil was similar to the top layer as N fertilization was greater than 90 kg N ha-1. It suggests that N application should be less than 90 kg ha-1 to reduce the movement of excess N to deep soil layers and cause a potential negative impact on environment in this area.

TI  - Towards development of on-line soil moisture content sensor using a fibre-type {NIR} spectrophotometer
VL  - 80
SN  - NA
AB  - As the soil moisture content (w) is a deterministic factor for site-specific irrigation, seeding, transplanting and compaction detection, an on-line measurement system will bring these applications into practice. A fibre-type visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer, with a light reflectance measurement range of 306.5-1710.9 nm was used to measure w during field operation. The spectrophotometer optical unit was attached to the subsoiler chisel backside to perform the light reflectance measurement from the soil surface on the bottom of the trench opened by the proceeded chisel. The spectrophotometer-optical unit system was calibrated for w under stationary laboratory conditions on samples collected from an Arenic Cambisol field with different soil textures. A partial least square analysis was carried out in order to establish a statistical model relating soil light spectra with the gravimetric w of the 0.005-0.26 kg kg-1 range. This model was validated with the full cross validation method resulting in a small root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 0.0175 kg kg-1 and a high validation correlation of 0.978. Further validation of the model developed in the laboratory under stationary state showed also a small root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0165 kg kg-1 and a prediction correlation of 0.982. When the NIR sensor-model system was used to determine w, based on on-line field measurement, a relatively larger RMSEP of 0.025 kg kg-1 and lower prediction correlation of 0.75 were found. However, a reasonably similar spatial distribution of w was found between the on-line NIR measurement and oven drying methods. Therefore, the on-line NIR w sensor developed is recommended to provide valuable information towards the site-specific applications in soils. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study compares simulation results using TerrSysMP including a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) of a 38 ha managed grassland head-water catchment in the Eifel (Germany), with soil water content (SWC) measurements from a wireless sensor network, actual evapotranspiration recorded by lysimeters and eddy covariance stations and discharge observations. TerrSysMP was discretized with a 10 Ã— 10 m lateral resolution, variable vertical resolution (0.025â€“0.575 m), and the following parameterization strategies of the subsurface soil hydraulic parameters: (i) completely homogeneous, (ii) homogeneous parameters for different soil horizons, (iii) different parameters for each soil unit and soil horizon and (iv) heterogeneous stochastic realizations. Hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-Van Genuchten parameters in these simulations were sampled from probability density functions, constructed from either (i) soil texture measurements and Rosetta pedotransfer functions (ROS), or (ii) estimated soil hydraulic parameters by 1D inverse modelling using shuffle complex evolution (SCE). The results indicate that the spatial variability of SWC at the scale of a small headwater catchment is dominated by topography and spatially heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameters. The spatial variability of the soil water content thereby increases as a function of heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters. For lower levels of complexity, spatial variability of the SWC was underrepresented in particular for the ROS-simulations. Whereas all model simulations were able to reproduce the seasonal evapotranspiration variability, the poor discharge simulations with high model bias are likely related to short-term ET dynamics and the lack of information about bedrock characteristics and an on-site drainage system in the uncalibrated model. In general, simulation performance was better for the SCE setups. The SCE-simulations had a higher inverse air entry parameter resulting in SWC dynamics in better correspondence with data than the ROS simulations during dry periods. This illustrates that small scale measurements of soil hydraulic parameters cannot be transferred to the larger scale and that interpolated 1D inverse parameter estimates result in an acceptable performance for the catchment.

TI  - A seven-rod dielectric sensor for determination of soil moisture in well-defined sample volumes
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents a novel seven-rod sensor used for time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) measurements of soil water content in a well-defined sample volume. The probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soilsâ€”sandy loam and two silt loamsâ€”with six water contents from air-dry to saturation. The conversion from S11 parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were compared with Toppâ€™s equation. It was concluded that the best fit to Toppâ€™s equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and Roth gave results closer to Toppâ€™s calibration. The obtained results indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of about 8 cm3 in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.

TI  - Integrated method of {RS} and {GPR} for monitoring the changes in the soil moisture and groundwater environment due to underground coal mining
VL  - 57
SN  - NA
AB  - Mining affects the environment in different ways depending on the physical context in which the mining occurs. In mining areas with an arid environment, mining affects plants' growth by changing the amount of available water. This paper discusses the effects of mining on two important determinants of plant growth-soil moisture and groundwater table (GWT)-which were investigated using an integrated approach involving a field sampling investigation with remote sensing (RS) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). To calculate and map the distribution of soil moisture for a target area, we initially analyzed four models for regression analysis between soil moisture and apparent thermal inertia and finally selected a linear model for modeling the soil moisture at a depth 10 cm; the relative error of the modeled soil moisture was about 6.3\% and correlation coefficient 0.7794. A comparison of mined and unmined areas based on the results of limited field sampling tests or RS monitoring of Landsat 5-thermatic mapping (TM) data indicated that soil moisture did not undergo remarkable changes following mining. This result indicates that mining does not have an effect on soil moisture in the Shendong coal mining area. The coverage of vegetation in 2005 was compared with that in 1995 by means of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) deduced from TM data, and the results showed that the coverage of vegetation in Shendong coal mining area has improved greatly since 1995 because of policy input RMBÂ¥0.4 per ton coal production by Shendong Coal Mining Company. The factor most affected by coal mining was GWT, which dropped from a depth of 35.41 m before mining to a depth of 43.38 m after mining at the Bulianta Coal Mine based on water well measurements. Ground-penetrating radar at frequencies of 25 and 50 MHz revealed that the deepest GWT was at about 43.4 m. There was a weak water linkage between the unsaturated zone and groundwater, and the decline of water table primarily resulted from the well pumping for mining safety rather than the movement of cracking strata. This result is in agreement with the measurements of the water wells. The roots of nine typical plants in the study area were investigated. Populus was found to have the deepest root system with a depth of about 26 m. Based on an assessment of plant growth demands and the effect of mining on environmental factors, we concluded that mining will have less of an effect on plant growth at those sites where the primary GWT depth before mining was deep enough to be unavailable to plants. If the primary GWT was available for plant growth before mining, especially to those plants with deeper roots, mining will have a significant effect on the growth of plants and the mechanism of this effect will include the loss of water to roots and damage to the root system.

TI  - Stocking method, animal behavior, and soil nutrient redistribution: {How} are they linked?
VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Choice of stocking method may impact soil, plant, and animal responses. This 3-yr study evaluated stocking method effects on animal behavior and soil nutrient concentration in 'Pensacola' bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum FlÃ¼gge) pastures. Stocking methods were continuous stocking and rotational stocking with 1-, 3-, 7-, and 21-d grazing periods and a 21-d resting period. Responses were measured in three zones based on distance from shade and water (Zone 1, 0-8 m; Zone 2, 8-16 m; Zone 3, {\textgreater}16 m). Indices were calculated to weight number of dung and urine events and time spent by cattle in a zone by the proportion of the total pasture and paddock area represented by that zone. Indices were most uniform ( 1) across zones for rotational stocking with short grazing periods and generally increased linearly in Zones 1 and 2 with increasing grazing period. Except for N, soil nutrient concentration was not affected by stocking method. In zones closest to shade and water, soil nutrients accumulated for all methods in the surface 8 cm but not in the 8-to 23-cm layer. Air temperature, wind speed, and temperature-humidity index explained 49\% of the variation in time cattle spent under shade, confirming the importance of the environment in animal behavior. In warm environments, structural features of stocking method (e.g., the position of shade and water) have a greater effect on animal behavior and distribution in the landscape than do stocking density-mediated effects on competition for forage.

TI  - Combining an ecological model with remote sensing and {GIS} techniques to monitor soil water content of croplands with a monsoon climate
VL  - 97
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water is an important factor affecting photosynthesis, transpiration, growth, and yield of crops. Accurate information on soil water content (SWC) is crucial for practical agricultural water management at various scales. In this study, remotely sensed parameters (leaf area index, land cover type, and albedo) and spatial data manipulated using the geographic information system (GIS) technique were assimilated into the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS) model to monitor SWC dynamics of croplands in Jiangsu Province, China. The monsoon climate here is characterized by large interannual and seasonal variability of rainfall causing periods of high and low SWC. Model validation was conducted by comparing simulated SWC with measurements by a gravimetric method in the years 2005 and 2006 at nine agro-meteorological stations. The model-to-measurement R2 values ranged from 0.40 to 0.82. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values were in the range from 0.10 to 0.80. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 0.028 to 0.056 m3 m-3. Simulated evapotranspiration (ET) was consistent with ET estimated from pan evaporation measurements. The BEPS model successfully tracked the dynamics and extent of the serious soil water deficit that occurred during September-November 2006. These results demonstrate the applicability of combining process-based models with remote sensing and GIS techniques in monitoring SWC of croplands and improving agricultural water management at regional scales in a monsoon climate.

TI  - A quasi-global evaluation system for satellite-based surface soil moisture retrievals
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - A recently developed data assimilation technique offers the potential to greatly expand the geographic domain over which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals can be evaluated by effectively substituting (relatively plentiful) rain-gauge observations for (less commonly available) ground-based soil moisture measurements. The technique is based on calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient Rvalue between rainfall errors and Kalman filter analysis increments realized during the assimilation of a remotely sensed soil moisture product into the antecedent precipitation index (API). Here, the existing Rvalue approach is modified by reformulating it to run on an anomaly basis where long-term seasonal trends are explicitly removed and by calculating API analysis increments using a RauchTungStriebel smoother instead of a Kalman filter. This reformulated approach is then applied to a number of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer soil moisture products acquired within three heavily instrumented watershed sites in the southern U.S. Rvalue-based evaluations of soil moisture products within these sites are verified based on comparisons with available ground-based soil moisture measurements. Results demonstrate that, without access to ground-based soil moisture measurements, the Rvalue; methodology can accurately mimic anomaly correlation coefficients calculated between remotely sensed soil moisture products and soil moisture observations obtained from dense ground-based networks. Sensitivity results also indicate that the predictive skill of the Rvalue metric is enhanced by both proposed modifications to its methodology. Finally,Rvalue calculations are expanded to a quasi-global (50Â° S50Â°N) domain using rainfall measurements derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Precipitation Analysis. Spatial patterns in calculated Rvalue fields are compared to regions of strong landatmosphere coupling and used to refine expectations concerning the global distribution of land areas in which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals will contribute to atmospheric forecasting applications.

TI  - Emerging methods for noninvasive sensing of soil moisture dynamics from field to catchment scale: a review
VL  - 2
SN  - 2049-1948
AB  - Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial system because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this study, we review recent advances in noninvasive techniques that allow continuous noninvasive and contactless measurements of soil moisture dynamics at the field to basin scale. In particular, we report on (1) cosmic-ray neutron probes, (2) Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry, (3) ground-based microwave radiometry, (4) gamma-ray monitoring, (5) terrestrial gravimetry, and (6) low-frequency electromagnetic surface waves. Each method is described in terms of its basic principle, measurement scales, calibration issues, measurement accuracy, and applications. We hope that this review will further stimulate the community to invest in the continued development of novel soil moisture sensing methods that address the need for large-scale soil water content measurements with sufficiently high temporal resolution.

VL  - 11
SN  - 1525-755X
AB  - The study presents an in-depth investigation of the properties of remotely sensed rainfall error propagation in the prediction of near-surface soil moisture from a land surface model (LSM). Specifically, two error sources are compared: rainfall forcing due to estimation error by remote sensing techniques and the representation of land-atmospheric processes due to LSM uncertainty [ the Community Land Model, version 3.5 (CLM3.5), was used in this particular study]. CLM3.5 is forced by three remotely sensed precipitation products, namely, two satellite-based estimates-NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multisatellite precipitation analysis and NOAA's Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH)-and a rain gauge-adjusted radar-rainfall product from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network. The error analysis is performed for the warm seasons of 2004 and 2006 and is facilitated through the use of in situ measurements of soil moisture, rainfall, and other meteorological variables from a network of stations capturing the state of Oklahoma (Oklahoma Mesonet). The study also presents a rigorous benchmarking of the Mesonet network as to its accuracy in deriving area rainfall estimates at the resolution of satellite products (0.25 degrees and 3 h) through comparisons against the most definitive measurements of a smaller-yet-denser network of rain gauges in southwestern Oklahoma (Micronet). The study compares error statistics between modeling and precipitation error sources and between the various remote sensing techniques. Results are contrasted between the relatively moist summer period of 2004 to the drier summer period of 2006, indicating model and error propagation dependencies. An intercomparison between rainfall and modeling error shows that the two error sources are of similar magnitudes in the case of high modeling accuracy (i.e., 2004), whereas the contribution of rainfall forcing error to the uncertainty of soil moisture prediction can be lower when the model's efficiency skill is relatively low (i.e., 2006).

VL  - 27
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroecological assessment of soil of Rivne region was conducted. Stabilization of main nutrients in the soils of the farmland of Forest-Steppe zone, due to the minimization of tillage, increased use of fertilizer, use tools of agriculture biologization as primarily plowing of straw, stalks and other crop residues and green manures, is shown. At the same time there is a downward trend in these indicators in soils of Polissya. The reduction mobile phosphorus and exchangeable potassium in soils of Polissya is associated with the decreasing use, in these areas, of organic and mineral fertilizers. Weighted average phosphorus content in Rivne region equals 125.3 mg/kg of dry soil; weighted average exchangeable potassium content equals 71.0 mg/kg of dry soil. The negative dynamics of soil acidity is shown. Areas with high acidity soils increased. Now they occupied 39.3 \% of the farmlands of the Rivne region. Sharply reduced availability of microelements in soil, due to the reduction g use of organic and mineral fertilizers on the territory of Rivne region, especially in Polissya, is shown. Recommendations for conservation and increasing of soil fertility of Rivne region are proposed.

TI  - Quantifying the change in soil moisture modeling uncertainty from remote sensing observations using {Bayesian} inference techniques
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Operational land surface models (LSMs) compute hydrologic states such as soil moisture that are needed for a range of important applications (e.g., drought, flood, and weather prediction). The uncertainty in LSM parameters is sufficiently great that several researchers have proposed conducting parameter estimation using globally available remote sensing data to identify best fit local parameter sets. However, even with in situ data at fine modeling scales, there can be significant remaining uncertainty in LSM parameters and outputs. Here, using a new uncertainty estimation subsystem of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) (described herein), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is applied to conduct Bayesian analysis for the accounting of parameter uncertainties. The Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) MCMC algorithm was applied, for which a new parallel implementation was developed. A case study is examined that builds on previous work in which the Noah LSM was calibrated to passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing estimates of soil moisture for the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. In keeping with prior related studies, the parameters subjected to the analysis were restricted to the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The main goal is to estimate SHPs and soil moisture simulation uncertainty before and after consideration of the remote sensing data. The prior SHP uncertainty is based on the original source of the standard SHP lookup tables for the Noah LSM. Conclusions are drawn regarding the value and viability of Bayesian analysis over alternative approaches (e.g., parameter estimation, lookup tables) and further research needs are identified.

TI  - Determining the frequency, depth and velocity of preferential flow by high frequency soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 144
SN  - NA
AB  - Preferential flow in agricultural soils has been demonstrated to result in agrochemical mobilisation to shallow ground water. Land managers and environmental regulators need simple cost effective techniques for identifying soil - land use combinations in which preferential flow occurs. Existing techniques for identifying preferential flow have a range of limitations including; often being destructive, non in situ, small sampling volumes, or are subject to artificial boundary conditions. This study demonstrated that high frequency soil moisture monitoring using a multi-sensory capacitance probe mounted within a vertically rammed access tube, was able to determine the occurrence, depth, and wetting front velocity of preferential flow events following rainfall. Occurrence of preferential flow was not related to either rainfall intensity or rainfall amount, rather preferential flow occurred when antecedent soil moisture content was below 226 mm soil moisture storage (0-70 cm). Results indicate that high temporal frequency soil moisture monitoring may be used to identify soil type - land use combinations in which the presence of preferential flow increases the risk of shallow groundwater contamination by rapid transport of agrochemicals through the soil profile. However use of high frequency based soil moisture monitoring to determine agrochemical mobilisation risk may be limited by, inability to determine the volume of preferential flow, difficulty observing macropore flow at high antecedent soil moisture content, and creation of artificial voids during installation of access tubes in stony soils.

TI  - Soil moisture-runoff relation at the catchment scale as observed with coarse resolution microwave remote sensing
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave remote sensing offers emerging capabilities to monitor global hydrological processes. Instruments like the two dedicated soil moisture missions SMOS and HYDROS or the Advanced Scatterometer onboard METOP will provide a flow of coarse resolution microwave data, suited for macro-scale applications. Only recently, the scatterometer onboard of the European Remote Sensing Satellite, which is the precursor instrument of the Advanced Scatterometer, has been used successfully to derive soil moisture information at global scale with a spatial resolution of 50 km. Concepts of how to integrate macroscale soil moisture data in hydrologic models are however still vague. In fact, the coarse resolution of the data provided by microwave radiometers and scatterometers is often considered to impede hydrological applications. Nevertheless, even if most hydrologic models are run at much finer scales, radiometers and scatterometers allow monitoring of atmosphere-induced changes in regional soil moisture patterns. This may prove to be valuable information for modelling hydrological processes in large river basins ({\textgreater}10 000 km2). In this paper, ERS scatterometer derived soil moisture products are compared to measured runoff of the Zambezi River in south-eastern Africa for several years (1992-2000). This comparison serves as one of the first demonstrations that there is hydrologic relevant information in coarse resolution satellite data. The observed high correlations between basin-averaged soil moisture and runoff time series (R2{\textgreater}0.85) demonstrate that the seasonal change from low runoff during the dry season to high runoff during the wet season is well captured by the ERS scatterometer. It can be expected that the high correlations are to a certain degree predetermined by the pronounced inter-annual cycle observed in the discharge behaviour of the Zambezi. To quantify this effect, time series of anomalies have been compared. This analysis showed that differences in runoff from year to year could, to some extent, be explained by soil moisture anomalies.

TI  - Effects of spatial distribution of soil parameters on soil moisture retrieval from passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - 55
SN  - 1674-7313
AB  - In this paper, we studied the effect of spatial distribution of soil parameters on passive soil moisture retrieval at pixel scale. First, we evaluated the forward microwave emission model and soil moisture retrieval algorithm accuracy through the observation of field experiments. Then, we used soil parameters in different spatial distribution patterns, including random, normal, and uniform distribution, to determine the different levels of heterogeneity on soil moisture retrieval, in order to seek the relationship between heterogeneity and soil moisture retrieval error. Finally, we conducted a controlled heterogeneity effect experiment measurements using a Truck-mounted Multi-frequency Radiometer (TMMR) to validate our simulation results. This work has proved that the soil moisture retrieval algorithm had a high accuracy (RMSE=0.049 cm(3) cm(-3)) and can satisfy the need of this research. The simulation brightness temperatures match well with observations, with RMSE=9.89 K. At passive microwave remote sensing pixel scale, soil parameters with different spatial distribution patterns could have different levels of error on soil moisture estimation. Overall, we found that soil moisture with a random distribution in a satellite pixel scale can cause the largest error, with a normal distribution being the second, and a uniform distribution the least due to the smallest heterogeneity.

TI  - Soil {Surface} {Sealing} {Effect} on {Soil} {Moisture} at a {Semiarid} {Hillslope}: {Implications} for {Remote} {Sensing} {Estimation
VL  - 6
SN  - 2072-4292
AB  - Robust estimation of soil moisture using microwave remote sensing depends on extensive ground sampling for calibration and validation of the data. Soil surface sealing is a frequent phenomenon in dry environments. It modulates soil moisture close to the soil surface and, thus, has the potential to affect the retrieval of soil moisture from microwave remote sensing and the validation of these data based on ground observations. We addressed this issue using a physically-based modeling approach that accounts explicitly for surface sealing at the hillslope scale. Simulated mean soil moisture at the respective layers corresponding to both the ground validation probe and the radar beam's typical effective penetration depth were considered. A cyclic pattern was found in which, as compared to an unsealed profile, the seal layer intensifies the bias in validation during rainfall events and substantially reduces it during subsequent drying periods. The analysis of this cyclic pattern showed that, accounting for soil moisture dynamics at the soil surface, the optimal time for soil sampling following a rainfall event is a few hours in the case of an unsealed system and a few days in the case of a sealed one. Surface sealing was found to increase the temporal stability of soil moisture. In both sealed and unsealed systems, the greatest temporal stability was observed at positions with moderate slope inclination. Soil porosity was the best predictor of soil moisture temporal stability, indicating that prior knowledge regarding the soil texture distribution is crucial for the application of remote sensing validation schemes.

TI  - Agricultural drought monitoring based on soil moisture derived from the optical trapezoid model in {Mozambique
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) at three depths (15, 25, and 30 cm), derived from the optical trapezoidal model (OPTRAM), was used for multiyear, multisite monitoring of agricultural droughts over two agricultural crops (Maize and Soybean) in southern Mozambique. The OPTRAM was implemented using satellite data from Sentinel-2 and was validated against field SM assessed by gravimetric methods and by Watermark Sensors in sandy-soils with very low water holding capacity (0.13 cm(3)/cm(3)). The OPTRAM model estimated the SM at 15 and 25 cm yielding a R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.79 and RMSE {\textless}= 0.030 cm(3)/cm(3). The OPTRAM-derived SM was successfully used as input to compute and map the soil water deficit index, an indicator of agricultural drought. The results indicate that OPTRAM can provide useful information to improve water productivity in cropland under the specific conditions of Mozambique agricultural systems and for early warning systems development.

TI  - Monitoring and prediction of soil moisture spatial-temporal variations from a hydropedological perspective: {A} review
VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate prediction of soil moisture spatial-temporal variations remains critical in agronomic, hydrological, pedological, and environmental studies. Traditional approaches of soil moisture monitoring and prediction have limitations of being time-consuming, labour-intensive, and costly for direct field observation; and having low spatial resolution for remote sensing, and inconsistent accuracy and reliability for landscape feature (e.g. topography, land use, vegetation) modelling. Innovative and effective approaches for accurate soil moisture simulation are needed. Pedological properties, including soil structure, particle size distribution, porosity, horizon, redox feature, and organic matter content, have been accepted as important factors controlling soil moisture and can be potentially used in soil moisture prediction. However, pedological properties mostly lack quantification (e.g. redox feature, horizon, soil structure), and soil sampling and analysis are time-consuming and costly, especially at large spatial scale. These limitations have restricted the utilisation of pedological information to predict soil moisture spatial-temporal variations at different spatial scales. To overcome these difficulties, new tools including geophysical tools and computed tomography, and new methods including mining soil survey information and integrating pedological information with landscape features and modelling, are proposed in this paper.

SN  - 2220-9964
AB  - Comprehensive surface soil moisture (SM) monitoring is a vital task in precision agriculture applications. SM monitoring includes remote sensing imagery monitoring and in situ sensor-based observational monitoring. Cloud computing can increase computational efficiency enormously. A geographical web service was developed to assist in agronomic decision making, and this tool can be scaled to any location and crop. By integrating cloud computing and the web service-enabled information infrastructure, this study uses the cloud computing-enabled spatio-temporal cyber-physical infrastructure (CESCI) to provide an efficient solution for soil moisture monitoring in precision agriculture. On the server side of CESCI, diverse Open Geospatial Consortium web services work closely with each other. Hubei Province, located on the Jianghan Plain in central China, is selected as the remote sensing study area in the experiment. The Baoxie scientific experimental field in Wuhan City is selected as the in situ sensor study area. The results show that the proposed method enhances the efficiency of remote sensing imagery mapping and in situ soil moisture interpolation. In addition, the proposed method is compared to other existing precision agriculture infrastructures. In this comparison, the proposed infrastructure performs soil moisture mapping in Hubei Province in 1.4 min and near real-time in situ soil moisture interpolation in an efficient manner. Moreover, an enhanced performance monitoring method can help to reduce costs in precision agriculture monitoring, as well as increasing agricultural productivity and farmers' net-income.

TI  - Di-{Sense}: {In} situ real-time permittivity estimation and soil moisture sensing using wireless underground communications
VL  - 151
SN  - NA
AB  - Internet of Underground Things (IOUT) communications have the potential for soil properties estimation and soil moisture monitoring. In this paper, a method has been developed for real-time in situ estimation of relative permittivity of soil, and soil moisture, that is determined from the propagation path loss, and velocity of wave propagation of an underground (UG) transmitter and receiver link in wireless underground communications (WUC). The permittivity and soil moisture estimation processes (Di-Sense, where Di- prefix means two) are modeled and validated through an outdoor UG software-defined radio (SDR) testbed, and indoor greenhouse testbed. SDR experiments are conducted in the frequency range of 100â€“500 MHz, using antennas buried at 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm depths in different soils under different soil moisture levels, by using dipole antennas with over the air (OTA) resonant frequency of 433 MHz. Experiments are conducted in silt loam, silty clay loam, and sandy soils. By using Di-Sense approach, soil moisture and permittivity can be measured with high accuracy in 1â€“15 m distance range in plant root zone up to depth of 40 cm. The estimated soil parameters have less than 8\% estimation error from the ground truth measurements and semi-empirical dielectric mixing models. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The value of satellite remote sensing soil moisture data and the {DISPATCH} algorithm in irrigation fields
VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture measurements are needed in a large number of applications such as hydro-climate approaches, watershed water balance management and irrigation scheduling. Nowadays, different kinds of methodologies exist for measuring soil moisture. Direct methods based on gravimetric sampling or time domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques measure soil moisture in a small volume of soil at few particular locations. This typically gives a poor description of the spatial distribution of soil moisture in relatively large agriculture fields. Remote sensing of soil moisture provides widespread coverage and can overcome this problem but suffers from other problems stemming from its low spatial resolution. In this context, the DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange (DISPATCH) algorithm has been proposed in the literature to downscale soil moisture satellite data from 40 to 1\&thinsp;km resolution by combining the low-resolution Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite soil moisture data with the high-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) datasets obtained from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In this work, DISPATCH estimations are compared with soil moisture sensors and gravimetric measurements to validate the DISPATCH algorithm in an agricultural field during two different hydrologic scenarios: wet conditions driven by rainfall events and wet conditions driven by local sprinkler irrigation. Results show that the DISPATCH algorithm provides appropriate soil moisture estimates during general rainfall events but not when sprinkler irrigation generates occasional heterogeneity. In order to explain these differences, we have examined the spatial variability scales of NDVI and LST data, which are the input variables involved in the downscaling process. Sample variograms show that the spatial scales associated with the NDVI and LST properties are too large to represent the variations of the average soil moisture at the site, and this could be a reason why the DISPATCH algorithm does not work properly in this field site.

TI  - SMOSREX}: {A} long term field campaign experiment for soil moisture and land surface processes remote sensing
VL  - 102
SN  - NA
AB  - The primary goal of the SMOS mission is to deliver global fields of sea surface salinity and surface soil moisture using L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometry. Within the context of the preparation of SMOS activities over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January 2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both bare soil and fallow plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX combines land-surface-atmosphere observations, passive microwave measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years. The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal, seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over bare soil and fallow area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19 months). Soil freezing is shown to be drastically different for bare soil and vegetation covered plots, with a large threshold effect on microwave surface emission. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Hedgerows with intercropping systems were established at the ICIMOD test and demonstration site at Godawari to assess the effectiveness of Sloping Agricultural Land Technology (SALT) in reducing runoff water volume, controlling soil loss, increasing crop production, and improving soil fertility in the mid-hills of Nepal. Runoff water volume (1996-2002), soil loss (1996-2002) and maize yield (1995-2001), and soil fertility-related parameters were assessed on SALT models with three factors: the type of nitrogen-fixing plant, the farmers' practice, and fertilizer use. Results showed a significant effect of Alnus nepalensis and/or Indigofera dosua on runoff water volume, soil loss, crop production, soil water retention, and soil nutrients (NPK). Farmers' practice and fertilization did not play a significant role in reducing runoff water and soil loss. However, farmers' practice significantly increased crop production. Therefore, integrating soil conservation approaches on SALT systems enhances stable economic output to hills and mountain farmers.

TI  - A linear physically-based model for remote sensing of soil moisture using short wave infrared bands
VL  - 164
SN  - NA
AB  - Technological advances in satellite remote sensing have offered a variety of techniques for estimating surface soil water content as a key variable in numerous environmental studies. Optical methods are particularly valuable for remote sensing of soil moisture since reflected solar radiation is the strongest passive signal available to satellites and thus observations at optical wavelengths are capable of providing high spatial resolution data. Since remote sensors do not measure soil water content directly, mathematical algorithms that describe the connection between the measured signal and surface water content must be derived. Here, we present a physically-based soil moisture retrieval model in the solar domain (350-2500. nm) that is based on the Kubelka-Munk two-flux radiative transfer theory. The model is designed to describe diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The theory suggests a linear relationship between a transformed reflectance and soil water content in the short wave infrared bands (e.g. band 7 of Landsat and MODIS satellites) providing an easy-to-use algorithm in these bands. Accuracy of this model was tested and preliminarily verified using laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of different soils. Further studies on potentials and challenges of this model for large-scale application using optical satellites data remain a topic of ongoing research. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of soil fertility for agroforestry combined with water harvesting in {Central} {Chile
VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry associated with water harvesting was evaluated in field experiments conducted in central Chile, 1996-2008. Soil fertility parameters, such as soil organic matter (SOM), soil reaction (pH), total nitrogen (NT), total phosphorus (PT) and total potassium (KT) contents were measured for five different treatments: control (C), agroforestry (A), agroforestry with water harvesting (AR), woody perennial (W) and woody perennial with water harvesting (WR). Acacia saligna was used as the woody perennial component. Treatments, including Acacia saligna (A, AR, W and WR) increased SOM and NT stocks over time compared with the control, probably due to higher SOM and N inputs from the litter and root turnover. The treatments with water harvesting (AR and WR) showed the highest SOM and NT contents by 2008, suggesting that this practice had positive effects on water infiltration rates and soil water content in the soil, important parameters in the process of root turnover. However, there were no significant differences in other soil parameters, such as pH, PT and KT, perhaps due to the short study time, and soil spatial and temporal variability between treatments.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate mapping of long-term global soil moisture is of great importance to earth science studies and a variety of applications. An approach for deriving volumetric soil moisture using satellite passive microwave radiometry from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed in this study. Unlike the major AMSR-E retrieval algorithms that assume fixed scattering albedo values over the globe, the proposed algorithm adopts a weighted averaging strategy for soil moisture estimation based on a dynamic selection of albedo values that are empirically determined. The resulting soil moisture retrievals demonstrate more realistic global patterns and seasonal dynamics relative to the baseline University of Montana soil moisture product. Quantitative analysis of the new approach against in situ soil moisture measurements over four study regions also indicates improvements over the baseline algorithm, with coefficients of determination (R2) between the retrievals and in situ measurements increasing by approximately 16.9\% and 41.5\% and bias-corrected root-mean-square errors decreasing by about 25.0\% and 38.2\% for ascending and descending orbital data records, respectively. The resulting algorithm is readily applied to similar microwave sensors, including the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, and its retrieval strategy is also applicable to other passive microwave sensors, including lower frequency (L-band) observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive mission.

TI  - A simple method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors: {Laboratory} validation in sands
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a two-point Î±-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types. A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types of ECH 2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents (Î¸) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point Î±-mixing model was fitted to the X-Î¸ data and a fitting parameter, Î±, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely used sensors, the CS616 and the Theta Probe ML2x, were also tested using the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers, including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were lumped into Î±. The value of Î± was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with high r 2 values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models that require a large number of X-Î¸ data. After the Î± value is fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point Î±-mixing model requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values, i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point Î±-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or laboratory experiments.

TI  - The measurement and quantification of generalized gradients of soil fertility relevant to plant community ecology
VL  - 100
SN  - NA
AB  - We propose an operational definition of soil â€œfertilityâ€ that is applicable to plant community ecology and develop a method of measuring and quantifying it, using structural equations modeling, that is generalizable to soils in different regions whose fertility has different causes. To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent â€œgeneralized fertility,â€ F G , of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F G in this study were the supply rates of NO 3 âˆ’ , P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The F G values predicted 51\% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.

TI  - Soil nutrient evaluation from swine effluent application to five forage-system practices
VL  - 82
SN  - NA
AB  - Many contract swine producers are located in the southeastern U.S. In this region almost all of the swine effluent from swine production is applied to warm-season perennial species such as bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] which is widely grown for summer grazing and hay production. A 3-yr study was conducted to investigate the impact of forage double-cropping on nutrient accumulation and leaching in Mantachie fine loam soil fertilized with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) lagoon effluent as the source of plant nutrients. Plots of previously established Tifton 44 bermudagrass were overseeded in the fall with one of four winter annuals: berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.); crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.); ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.); or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four plots of bermudagrass were not overseeded and considered as control. Plots were harvested in spring for cool-season annual hay and in summer for bermudagrass hay. Swine effluent was applied during spring and summer on a need base. Suction lysimeters were installed in selected plots at two depths to monitor nutrient leaching. Surface soil samples were taken to determine baseline nutrient contents, followed by three other sampling dates during the study. Bermudagrass dry matter production (3-yr average = 9.8 Mg ha-1) was not adversely affected by the overseeding treatments. Greatest dry matter production was achieved with bermudagrass overseeded with ryegrass (3-yr average = 11.3 Mg ha-1). Soil pH decreased by almost one unit by the end of the study. While total P (TP) did not change much, Mehlich-3 P (M3-P), K, Cu, and Zn increased significantly, Mg and Mn concentrations decreased by 2002 compared to the baseline levels. Soil P, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, and Zn accumulation were greater under bermudagrass/wheat combination. In general, the influence of double cropping on soil nutrient accumulation was not conclusive, however, this practice provides the year-round green forage for grazing and haying. Nutrient concentrations in soil and lysimeter leachate were directly related to the quantity of effluent applied. Results also demonstrated that effluent application must be coordinated with the nutrient requirements of the growing forages in order to minimize accumulation and leaching.

TI  - Design and performance of a wireless sensor network for catchment-scale snow and soil moisture measurements
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - [1] A wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed as part of a water balance instrument cluster across a forested 1 km2 headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The network, which integrates readings from over 300 sensors, provides spatially representative measurements of snow depth, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. The ability of this densely instrumented watershed to capture catchment-scale snow depth and soil moisture distributions is investigated through comparison with three comprehensive gridded surveys and 1 day of detailed lidar snow data. Statistical analysis shows that the network effectively characterized catchment-wide distributions of snow depth, while offering a cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient means for collecting distributed data in real time. A temporal analysis of snow depth variability reveals that canopy cover is the major explanatory variable of snow depth and that under-canopy measurements persistently show higher variability compared to those in open terrain. An analysis of soil moisture shows lower variability at deeper soil depth and a correlation between mean soil moisture and variability for shallow soils. A three-phase design procedure was used to optimize the WSN deployment. First, as off-the-shelf performance of current WSN platforms for large-scale, long-term deployments cannot be guaranteed, statistics from a prototype deployment were analyzed. Two indicators of network performance, the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator, showed that for our site conditions, a conservative 50 m node-to-node spacing would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. Second, results from the prototype were used to refine hardware specifications and to guide the layout of the full 57-node wireless network. Of these nodes, 23 were used actively for sensing, while the remaining 34 nodes were used as signal repeaters to ensure proper spatial radio coverage and robust network operations. Further analysis of network statistics is conducted during the third, operational, phase to validate system performance. Â© 2012. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Crop {RS}-{Met}: {A} biophysical evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content model for crops based on proximal sensing and meteorological data
VL  - 211
SN  - NA
AB  - Assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning, particularly in water-limited regions. Here, we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data (Crop RS-Met). The model, which is based on the dual FAO56 formulation, uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions. We tested the Crop RS-Met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T. durum) cultivars with diverse phenology. Crop RS-Met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season. The average R2 of modeled vs. observed soil water content for all cultivars (N = 11) was 0.92 Â± 0.02 with average relative RMSE and bias of 9.29 Â± 1.30\% and 0.13 Â± 0.03\%, respectively. We found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in Crop RS-Met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions. Currently, Crop RS-Met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile. Thus, efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a Crop RS-Met model driven by high-resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics.

TI  - Contribution of {EMI} and {GPR} proximal sensing data in soil water content assessment by using linear mixed effects models and geostatistical approaches
VL  - 343
SN  - NA
AB  - The estimation of topsoil water content is of primary interest in the framework of precision farming, but, in general, such assessment is costly and complicated by several interfering factors which do not allow an accurate prediction. Proximal sensing can provide suitable technological facilities to support researchers and technicians in this task. GPR and EMI sensors are valuable instruments as they can provide very informative covariates to be used for improving soil water content estimation. In the present work, it was explored the single (EMI or GPR) and the combined (EMI + GPR) contribution of these proximal data sources. Furthermore, geostatistical (Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with external drift) and linear mixed effects models were applied to compare their respective predictive capabilities. As a result, GPR demonstrated to be more effective in estimating topsoil water content with respect to EMI but, combining both the information, an improvement in the prediction accuracy was observed. Moreover, adding more covariates in the models (GPR outcomes or GPR + EMI outcomes) allowed filtering out the structured spatial component of soil water content. Finally, the statistical approaches proved to behave very similarly, with a slight better performance of Kriging with external drift. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Trends of {Yield} and {Soil} {Fertility} in a {Long}-{Term} {Wheat}-{Maize} {System
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - The sustainability of the wheat-maize rotation is important to China's food security. Intensive cropping without recycling crop residues or other organic inputs results in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients, and is assumed to be non-sustainable. We evaluated the effects of nine different treatments on yields, nitrogen use efficiency, P and K balances, and soil fertility in a wheat-maize rotation system (1991-2010) on silt clay loam in Shaanxi, China. The treatments involved the application of recommended dose of nitrogen (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorus and potassium (PK), combined NPK, wheat or maize straw (S) with NPK (SNPK), or dairy manure (M) with NPK (M1NPK and M2NPK), along with an un-treated control treatment (CK). The mean yields of wheat and maize ranged from 992 and 2 235 kg ha-1 under CK to 5 962 and 6 894 kg ha-1 under M2NPK treatment, respectively. Treatments in which either N or P was omitted (N, NK and PK) gave significantly lower crop yields than those in which both were applied. The crop yields obtained under NP, NPK and SNPK treatments were statistically identical, as were those obtained under SNPK and MNPK. However, M2NPK gave a significant higher wheat yield than NP, and MNPK gave significant higher maize yield than both NP and NPK. Wheat yields increased significantly (by 86 to 155 kg ha-1 yr-1) in treatments where NP was applied, but maize yields did not. In general, the nitrogen use efficiency of wheat was the highest under the NP and NPK treatments; for maize, it was the highest under MNPK treatment. The P balance was highly positive under MNPK treatment, increasing by 136 to 213 kg ha-1 annually. While the K balance was negative in most treatments, ranging from 31 to 217 kg ha-1 yr-1, levels of soil available K remained unchanged or increased over the 20 yr. SOM levels increased significantly in all treatments. Overall, the results indicated that combinations of organic manure and inorganic nitrogen, or returning straw with NP is likely to improve soil fertility, increasing the yields achievable with wheat-maize system in a way which is environmentally and agronomically beneficial on the tested soil.

TI  - Temporal stability of soil moisture in various semi-arid steppe ecosystems and its application in remote sensing
VL  - 359
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture is often necessary in hydrological studies on various scales. One of the challenges is to determine the mean soil moisture of large areas with minimum labour and costs. The aim of this study is to test temporal persistence of sample locations to decrease the number of samples required to make reliable estimates of mean moisture content in the top soil. Soil moisture data on four experimental sites were collected during the vegetation period in 2004-2006. The experimental sites are located in a steppe environment in northern China, and are characterised by different grazing management which causes differences in vegetation cover. A total of 100 sampling points per site were ranked with respect to their difference to field mean soil moisture using the time-stability concept. We tested whether: (a) representative sample locations exist that predict field mean soil moisture to an acceptable degree, and (b) these locations are time-stable beyond a single vegetation period. Time-stable locations with a low deviation from mean field soil moisture and low standard deviation were identified for each site. Although the time-stability characteristics of some points varied between years, the selected points were appropriate to predict mean soil moisture of the sites for multiple years. On the field scale, time-stability and the persistence of patterns were analysed by the use of a Spearman rank correlation. The analysis showed that persistence depended on grazing management and the related plant cover. It is concluded that the time-stability concept provides useful information for the validation of hydrological or remote sensing models, or for the upscaling of soil moisture information to larger scales. A preliminary comparison of soil moisture measurements derived from ground-truth and remote sensing data showed that the data matched well in some cases, but that the considerable difference in spatial extent promotes differences in other cases.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - The impact of direct-seeding mulch-based cropping systems (DMC), direct seeding (DS) and tillage seeding (TS) on Sorghum yields, soil fertility and the rehabilitation of degraded soils was evaluated in northern Cameroon. Field work consisted of visual examination, soil sampling, yield and rainfall data collection. Three fertilization rates (F1: 100 kg ha-1 NPK + 25 kg ha-1 of urea in DMC, F2: 200 kg -1 NPK + 50 kg ha-1 of urea in DMC and F3: 300 kg ha-1 NPK + 100 kg ha-1 of urea in DMC) were applied to each cropping system (DS, TS and DMC), resulting in nine experimental plots. Two types of chemical fertilizer were used (NPK 22.10.15 and urea) and applied each year from 2002 to 2012. Average Sorghum yields were 1239, 863 and 960 kg ha-1 in DMC, DS and TS, respectively, at F1, 1658, 1139 and 1192 kg ha-1 in DMC, DS and TS, respectively, at F2, and 2270, 2138 and 1780 kg ha-1 in DMC, DS and TS, respectively, at F3. pH values were 5.2-5.7 under DMC, 4.9-5.3 under DS and TS and 5.6 in the control sample. High values of cation exchange capacity were recorded in the control sample, TS system and F1 of DMC. Base saturation rates, total nitrogen and organic matter contents were higher in the control sample and DMC than in the other systems. All studied soils were permanently not suitable for Sorghum due to the high percentage of nodules. F1 and F2 of the DS were currently not suitable, while F1 and F3 of DMC, F3 of DS and F1, F2 and F3 of TS were marginally suitable for Sorghum due to low pH values. Â© Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Triple collocation-based estimation of spatially correlated observation error covariance in remote sensing soil moisture data assimilation
VL  - 12
SN  - 1931-3195
AB  - Spatially correlated errors are typically ignored in data assimilation, thus degenerating the observation error covariance R to a diagonal matrix. We argue that a nondiagonal R carries more observation information making assimilation results more accurate. A method, denoted TC\_Cov, was proposed for soil moisture data assimilation to estimate spatially correlated observation error covariance based on triple collocation (TC). Assimilation experiments were carried out to test the performance of TC\_Cov. AMSR-E soil moisture was assimilated with a diagonal R matrix computed using the TC and assimilated using a nondiagonal R matrix, as estimated by proposed TC\_Cov. The ensemble Kalman filter was considered as the assimilation method. Our assimilation results were validated against climate change initiative data and ground-based soil moisture measurements using the Pearson correlation coefficient and unbiased root mean square difference metrics. These experiments confirmed that deterioration of diagonal R assimilation results occurred when model simulation is more accurate than observation data. Furthermore, nondiagonal R achieved higher correlation coefficient and lower ubRMSD values over diagonal R in experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of TC\_Cov to estimate richly structuralized R in data assimilation. In sum, compared with diagonal R, nondiagonal R may relieve the detrimental effects of assimilation when simulated model results outperform observation data.

TI  - Detecting and analyzing soil phosphorus loss associated with critical source areas using a remote sensing approach
VL  - 573
SN  - NA
AB  - The detection of critical source areas (CSAs) is a key step in managing soil phosphorus (P) loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of water bodies at regional scale. Most related studies, however, focus on a local scale, which prevents a clear understanding of the spatial distribution of CSAs for soil P loss at regional scale. Moreover, the continual, long-term variation in CSAs was scarcely reported. It is impossible to identify the factors driving the variation in CSAs, or to collect land surface information essential for CSAs detection, by merely using the conventional methodologies at regional scale. This study proposes a new regional-scale approach, based on three satellite sensors (ASTER, TM/ETM and MODIS), that were implemented successfully to detect CSAs at regional scale over 15 years (2000â€“2014). The approach incorporated five factors (precipitation, slope, soil erosion, land use, soil total phosphorus) that drive soil P loss from CSAs. Results show that the average area of critical phosphorus source areas (CPSAs) was 15,056 km2 over the 15-year period, and it occupied 13.8\% of the total area, with a range varying from 1.2\% to 23.0\%, in a representative, intensive agricultural area of China. In contrast to previous studies, we found that the locations of CSAs with P loss are spatially variable, and are more dispersed in their distribution over the long term. We also found that precipitation acts as a key driving factor in the variation of CSAs at regional scale. The regional-scale method can provide scientific guidance for managing soil phosphorus loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of water bodies at regional scale, and shows great potential for exploring factors that drive the variation in CSAs at global scale.

TI  - An algorithm to estimate soil moisture over vegetated areas based on \textit{in situ} and remote sensing information
VL  - 31
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - An algorithm is proposed for estimating soil moisture over vegetated areas. The algorithm uses in situ and remote sensing information and statistical tools to estimate soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution and at 20 cm depth over Puerto Rico. Soil moisture within the study region is characterized by spatial and temporal variability. The temporal variability for a given area exhibits long- and short-term variations that can be expressed by two empirical models. The average monthly soil moisture exhibits the long- term variability and is modelled by an artificial neural network ( ANN), whereas the short-term variability is determined by hourly variation and is represented by a nonlinear stochastic transfer function model. Monthly vegetation index, land surface temperature, accumulated rainfall and soil texture are the major drivers of the ANN to estimate the monthly soil moisture. Radar, satellite and in situ observations are the major sources of information of the soil moisture empirical models. A self-organized ANN was also used to identify spatial variability to be able to determine a similar transfer function that best resembles the properties of a particular grid point and estimate the hourly soil moisture across the island. Validation techniques reveal an average absolute error of 3.34\% of volumetric water content and this result shows that the proposed algorithm is a potential tool for estimating soil moisture over vegetated areas.

TI  - Electromagnetic scattering from multilayer rough surfaces with arbitrary dielectric profiles for remote sensing of subsurface soil moisture
VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - Radar remote sensing of soil moisture content at low frequencies requires an accurate scattering model of realistic soils, which often involves multilayer rough surfaces and dielectric profiles. In this paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to two-dimensional scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and transmission matrices of rough interfaces are constructed using EBCM. The dielectric profiles are modeled as stacks of piecewise homogeneous dielectric thin layers, whose scattering matrices are computed by recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and stratified dielectric profiles are taken into account by applying the generalized scattering matrix technique. The scattering coefficients are obtained by combining the powers computed from the resulting Floquet modes of the overall system. The bistatic scattering coefficients are validated against existing analytical and numerical solutions. Field-collected soil moisture data are then used for numerical simulations to investigate the penetration capability at different frequencies and to address the potential of low-frequency radar systems in estimating deep soil moisture. In particular, soil moisture profiles during dry ground, wet ground, and wet subsurface layer conditions are examined. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and copolarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using copolarized phase difference than scattering coefficients. Â© 2007 IEEE.

TI  - An observing system simulation experiment for the aquarius/{SAC}-{D} soil moisture product
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D mission has been developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from passive L-band remote sensing. The implementation of the OSSE is based on the following: a 1-km land surface model over the Red-Arkansas River Basin, a forward microwave emission model to simulate the radiometer observations, a realistic orbital and sensor model to resample the measurements mimicking Aquarius operation, and an inverse soil moisture retrieval model. The simulation implements a zero-order radiative transfer model. Retrieval is performed by direct inversion of the forward model. The Aquarius OSSE attempts to capture the influence of various error sources, such as land surface heterogeneity, instrument noise, and retrieval ancillary parameter uncertainty, all on the accuracy of Aquarius surface soil moisture retrievals. In order to assess the impact of these error sources on the estimated volumetric soil moisture, a quantitative error analysis is performed by comparison of footprint-scale synthetic soil moisture with 'true' soil moisture fields obtained from the direct aggregation of the original 1-km soil moisture field input to the forward model. Results show that, in heavily vegetated areas, soil moisture retrievals have a positive bias that can be suppressed with an alternative aggregation strategy for ancillary parameter vegetation water content (VWC). Retrieval accuracy was also evaluated when adding errors to 1-km VWC (which are intended to account for errors in VWC derived from remote sensing data). For soil moisture retrieval root-mean-square error on the order of 0.05 m3/m3, the error in VWC should be less than 12\%. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Improvement and field testing of a combined horizontal penetrometer for on-the-go measurement of soil water content and mechanical resistance
VL  - 123
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content has a significant effect on penetrometer resistance, so simultaneous on-the-go measurement of both these parameters can provide useful information on within-field spatial variations in soil compaction. In this study we improved and refined the electronic circuitry and mechanical construction of an existing sensor and evaluated it as a combined horizontal penetrometer in the field. This paper concentrates on its ability to determine soil water content (volumetric basis) in the field. Stationary calibration was first performed in the laboratory on remoulded loam soil (gleyic Cambisol) at gravimetric water content 0-0.28gg -1 and wet bulk density 1.4-1.8gcm -3. A quadratic relationship was found between sensor output and volumetric water content. Simulations of the sensor fringe field using a finite element model showed that at a dielectric constant of 5 (dry soil) the zone of influence of the sensor (i.e. the distance from the centre of the sensor) was approximately 70mm, whilst at a dielectric constant of 30 (an estimate of wet soil) it was 40mm. The dielectric sensor was then implemented together with a load cell on a tine for field measurement of water content and penetrometer resistance, and a series of transect measurements were conducted to assess its accuracy over a range of natural soil water contents in the field. Within the volumetric water content range 0.30-0.40cm 3cm -3, a linear relationship fitted the sensor output versus water content data, which was in close agreement with the laboratory calibration. Additional studies on the effect of travelling speed on dielectric sensor performance showed no clear trends, but further investigations are needed. A significant negative correlation was observed between penetrometer resistance and water content. The developed combined horizontal penetrometer can be a promising useful instrument for future studies in soil compaction and precision agriculture. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V..

VL  - 42
SN  - 0255-660X
AB  - The assessment and quantification of spatio-temporal soil characteristics and moisture patterns are important parameters in the monitoring and modeling of soil landscapes. Remote-sensing techniques can be applied to characterize and quantify soil moisture patterns, but only when dealing with bare soil. For soils with vegetation, it is only possible to quantify soil-moisture characteristics through indirect vegetation indicators, i.e. the â€œvitalityâ€ of plants. The â€œvitalityâ€ of vegetation is a sum of many indicators, whereby different stress factors can induce similar changes to the biochemical and physiological characteristics of plants. Analysis of the cause and effect of soil-moisture properties, patterns and stress factors can therefore only be carried out using an experimental approach that specifically separates the causes. The study describes an experimental approach and the results from using an imaging hyperspectral sensor AISA-EAGLE (400-970 nm) and a non-imaging spectral sensor ASD (400-2,500 nm) under controlled and comparable conditions in a laboratory to study the spectral response compared to biochemical and biophysical vegetation parameters (â€vitalityâ€) as a function of soil moisture characteristics over the entire blooming period of Ash trees. At the same time that measurements were taken from the hyperspectral sensors, the following vegetation variables were also recorded: leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll meter value - SPAD-205, vegetation height, C/N content and leaf water content as indicators of the â€œvitalityâ€ and the state of the vegetation. The spectrum of each hyperspectral image was used to calculate a range of vegetation indices (VI's) with relationships for soil moisture characteristics and stress factors. The relationship between vegetation indices and plant â€œvitalityâ€ indicators was analysed using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The results show that leaf water content is the most appropriate vegetation indicator for assessing the â€œvitalityâ€ of vegetation. With the Water Index (WI) it was possible to differentiate between the moisture treatments of the control, moisture drought stress and the moisture flooding treatment over the entire growing season of the plants (R (2) = 0.94). There is a correlation between the â€œvitalityâ€ vegetation parameters (LAI, C/N content and vegetation height) and the indicators NDVI, WI, PRI and Vog2. In our study with Ash trees the vegetation parameter chlorophyll was found not to be a suitable indicator for detecting the â€œvitalityâ€ of plants using the spectral indicators. There is a possibility that the sensitivity of the indicators selected was too low compared to changes in the chlorophyll content of Ash trees. Adding the co-variable `time' strengthens the correlation, whereas incorporating time and moisture treatment only improves the model very slightly. This shows that changes to the biochemical and biophysical characteristics caused by phenology, overlay a differentiation of the moisture treatments.

TI  - Experiments of one-dimensional soil moisture assimilation system based on ensemble {Kalman} filter
VL  - 112
SN  - NA
AB  - Ensemble Kalman filter is a new sequential data assimilation algorithm which was originally developed for atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation. It can be applied to calculate error covariance matrix through Monte-Carlo simulation. This approach is able to resolve the nonlinearity and discontinuity existed within model operator and observation operator. When observation data are assimilated at each time step, error covariances are estimated from the phase-space distribution of an ensemble of model states. The error statistics is then used to calculate Kalman gain matrix and analysis increments. In this study, we develop a one-dimensional soil moisture data assimilation system based on ensemble Kalman filter, the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) and microwave radiation transfer model (AIEM, advanced integration equation model). We conduct numerical experiments to assimilate in situ soil surface moisture measurements and low-frequency passive microwave remote sensing data into a land surface model, respectively. The results indicate that data assimilation can significantly improve the soil surface moisture estimation. The improvement in root zone is related to the model bias errors at surface layer and root zone. The soil moisture does not vary significantly in deep layer. Additionally, the ensemble Kalman filter is predominant in dealing with the nonlinearity of model operator and observation operator. It is practical and effective for assimilating observations in situ and remotely sensed data into land surface models. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a deterministic downscaling algorithm for remote sensing soil moisture footprint using soil and vegetation classifications
VL  - 49
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) at the local scale is required to account for small-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface because many hydrological processes manifest at scales ranging from cm to km. Although remote sensing (RS) platforms provide large-scale soil moisture dynamics, scale discrepancy between observation scale (e.g., approximately several kilometers) and modeling scale (e.g., few hundred meters) leads to uncertainties in the performance of land surface hydrologic models. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new deterministic downscaling algorithm (DDA) for estimating fine-scale soil moisture with pixel-based RS soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) products using a genetic algorithm. This approach was evaluated under various synthetic and field experiments (Little Washita-LW 13 and 21, Oklahoma) conditions including homogeneous and heterogeneous land surface conditions composed of different soil textures and vegetations. Our algorithm is based on determining effective soil hydraulic properties for different subpixels within a RS pixel and estimating the long-term soil moisture dynamics of individual subpixels using the hydrological model with the extracted soil hydraulic parameters. The soil moisture dynamics of subpixels from synthetic experiments matched well with the observations under heterogeneous land surface condition, although uncertainties (Mean Bias Error, MBE: -0.073 to -0.049) exist. Field experiments have typically more variations due to weather conditions, measurement errors, unknown bottom boundary conditions, and scale discrepancy between remote sensing pixel and model grid resolution. However, the soil moisture estimates of individual subpixels (from the airborne Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) footprints of 800 m Ã— 800 m) downscaled by this approach matched well (R: 0.724 to -0.914, MBE: -0.203 to -0.169 for the LW 13; R: 0.343-0.865, MBE: -0.165 to -0.122 for the LW 21) with the in situ local scale soil moisture measurements during Southern Great Plains Experiment 1997 (SGP97). The good correspondence of observed soil water characteristics Î¸(h) functions (from the soil core samples) and genetic algorithm (GA) searched soil parameters at the LW 13 and 21 sites demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. Although the algorithm is tested under limited conditions at field scale, this approach improves the availability of remotely sensed soil moisture product at finer resolution for various land surface and hydrological model applications.

TI  - Reconstruction and analysis of temporal and spatial variations in surface soil moisture in {China} using remote sensing
VL  - 57
SN  - 1001-6538
AB  - An ensemble method was used to combine three surface soil moisture products, retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing data, to reconstruct a monthly soil moisture data set for China between 2003 and 2010. Using the ensemble data set, the temporal and spatial variations of surface soil moisture were analyzed. The major findings were: (1) The ensemble data set was able to provide more realistic soil moisture information than individual remote sensing products; (2) during the study period, the soil moisture increased in semiarid regions and decreased in arid regions with anoverall drying trend for the whole country; (3) the soil moisture variation trends derived from the three retrieval products and the ensemble data differ from each other but all data sets show the dominant drying trend for the summer, and that most of the drying regions were in major agricultural areas; (4) compared with the precipitation trends derived from Global Precipitation Climatology Project data, it is speculated that climate change is a possible cause for the drying trend in semiarid regions and the wetting trend in arid regions; and (5) combining soil moisture trends with land surface temperature trends derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete, the study domain was divided into four categories. Regions with drying and warming trends cover 33.2\%, the regions with drying and cooling trends cover 27.4\%, the regions with wetting and warming trends cover 21.1\% and the regions with wetting and cooling trends cover 18.1\%. The first two categories primarily cover the major grain producing areas, while the third category primarily covers nonarable areas such as Northwest China and Tibet. This implies that the moisture and heat variation trends in China are unfavorable to sustainable development and ecology conservation.

TI  - Comparison of two retrieval methods with combined passive and active microwave remote sensing observations for soil moisture
VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - The brightness temperature (BT) and backscattering coefficient (BSC) measured simultaneously by passive and active microwave sensors have great potential for the estimation of land surface soil moisture (SM). Several methods with combined passive and active microwave remote sensing observations for SM have been reported. Usually, the use of these methods, requires an accurate roughness condition, especially when dealing over the bare surface or surface with low vegetation. In this paper, two different retrieval methods for estimating SM using synthetic microwave remote sensing data were compared. The difference between the two methods is the way to estimate the roughness parameter. The three-parameter retrieval approach (THRA) takes the roughness parameter as a variable to be retrieved, and derives land surface parameters (e.g., SM, surface temperature (ST) and roughness) simultaneously from BT and BSC using nonlinear algorithms. The two-parameter retrieval approach (TWRA) retrieves roughness from BSC firstly, then takes the roughness as an input parameter to retrieve SM and ST from BT. The two retrieval methods were applied on AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and QuikSCAT/Seawinds (The Seawinds scatterometer on NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Quick Scatterometer) observations which have been carried out for the SMEX03 (Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in ON, the north of Oklanoma. The comparison results shows TWRA has achieved a higher accuracy than THRA in dealing with the active and passive microwave observations at different overpass times. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An inter-comparison of soil moisture data products from satellite remote sensing and a land surface model
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Significant advances have been achieved in generating soil moisture (SM) products from satellite remote sensing and/or land surface modeling with reasonably good accuracy in recent years. However, the discrepancies among the different SM data products can be considerably large, which hampers their usage in various applications. The bias of one SM product from another is well recognized in the literature. Bias estimation and spatial correction methods have been documented for assimilating satellite SM product into land surface and hydrologic models. Nevertheless, understanding the characteristics of each of these SM data products is required for many applications where the most accurate data products are desirable. This study inter-compares five SM data products from three different sources with each other, and evaluates them against in situ SM measurements over 14-year period from 2000 to 2013. Specifically, three microwave (MW) satellite based data sets provided by ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (CCI-merged, -active and -passive products), one thermal infrared (TIR) satellite based product (ALEXI), and the Noah land surface model (LSM) simulations. The in-situ SM measurements are collected from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD), which involves more than 600 ground sites from a variety of networks. They are used to evaluate the accuracies of these five SM data products. In general, each of the five SM products is capable of capturing the dry/wet patterns over the study period. However, the absolute SM values among the five products vary significantly. SM simulations from Noah LSM are more stable relative to the satellite-based products. All TIR and MW satellite based products are relatively noisier than the Noah LSM simulations. Even though MW satellite based SM retrievals have been predominantly used in the past years, SM retrievals of the ALEXI model based on TIR satellite observations demonstrate skills equivalent to all the MW satellite retrievals and even slightly better over certain regions. Compared to the individual active and passive MW products, the merged CCI product exhibits higher anomaly correlation with both Noah LSM simulations and in-situ SM measurements. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Validation of the {ASAR} global monitoring mode soil moisture product using the {NAFE}'05 data set
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - The Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Global Monitoring (GM) mode offers an opportunity for global soil moisture (SM) monitoring at much finer spatial resolution than that provided by the currently operational Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System and future planned missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active Passive. Considering the difficulties in modeling the complex soilvegetation scattering mechanisms and the great need of ancillary data for microwave backscatter SM inversion, algorithms based on temporal change are currently the best method to examine SM variability. This paper evaluates the spatial sensitivity of the ASAR GM surface SM product derived using the temporal change detection methodology developed by the Vienna University of Technology. This evaluation is made for an area in southeastern Australia using data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005. The spatial evaluation is made using three different types of SM data (station, field, and airborne) across several different scales (125 km). Results confirmed the expected better agreement when using point(Rstation = 0.75) data as compared to spatial (RPLMR 1 km = 0.4) data. While the aircraftASAR GM correlation values at 1-km resolution were low, they significantly improved when averaged to 5 km (R PLMR 5 km = 0.67) or coarser. Consequently, this assessment shows the ASAR GM potential for monitoring SM when averaged to a spatial resolution of at least 5 km. Â© 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Drought is a major cause of limited agricultural productivity and of crop yield uncertainty throughout the world. For that reason, agricultural drought research and monitoring are of increasing interest. Although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought, the actual soil water content is rarely taken into account because this type of drought is commonly studied using methodologies based on either climatological data or hydrological modeling. Currently, it is possible to use remote sensing to obtain global and frequent soil moisture data that could be directly used for agricultural drought monitoring everywhere. For example, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite was launched in 2009 and provides global soil moisture maps every 1-2 days. In this work, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) was calculated using the SMOS L2 soil moisture series in the REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) area (Spain) during the period 2010-2014. The satellite index was thus calculated using several approaches to obtain the soil water parameters and was compared with the SWDI obtained from in situ data. One approach was based directly on SMOS soil moisture time series (using the 5th percentile as an estimator for wilting point and the 95th percentile and the minimum of the maximum value during the growing season as estimators for field capacity). In this case, the results of the comparison were good, but the temporal distribution and the range of the index data were unrealistic. Other approaches were based on in situ data parameters and pedotransfer functions estimation. In this case, the results were better, and the satellite index was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics. Therefore, the final choice to apply the index in one particular site will depend on the availability of data. Finally, a comparison analysis was made with the SMOS SWDI and two indices (Crop Moisture Index, CMI, and Atmospheric Water Deficit, AWD) commonly used for agricultural drought monitoring and assessment. In both cases, the agreement was very good, and it was proven that SMOS SWDI reproduces well the soil water balance dynamics and is able to appropriately track agricultural drought.

TI  - Value addition to crop residues: {An} indigenous resource conserving and soil fertility enhancing technology of {India
VL  - 31
SN  - 1044-0046
AB  - A two-year field experiment was conducted during the rainy seasons of 2004 and 2005 in the farmers' fields of Mahbubnagar district in Andhra Pradesh, India, to test the practice of cattle shed bedding with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) shells by preparing Groundnut Shell Manure (GSM) and its application along with Farmers' practice (FP) and in comparison with five treatments namely, FP only, FP and GSM, FP and compost, regenerative (only organics) and Recommended Dose of Fertilizers (RDF), FP and RDF being the checks on rainy season rainfed groundnut and castor (Ricinus communis L.) crops. The results indicated that crops receiving GSM and compost performed well during the deficit rainfall year (2004) as well as during the normal rainfall year (2005) and recorded 12-16\% higher yields of groundnut and 9-14\% higher yields in castor over the FP. During 2004 which was a deficit rainfall year, GSM and compost application enhanced soil moisture by 14-40\%, percentage of filled pods by 59-65\% and 100 seed weight by 18\% in groundnut while in castor 6-33\% improved soil moisture enhanced capsules per plant from 45 to 57\% without any significant effect on 100 seed weight. These treatments were followed by groundnut shell applied crop, RDF and regenerative (organics only) treatments. However, during 2005 the order in which higher yields achieved by treatments were GSM application, compost followed by RDF due to well-distributed rainfall. Therefore to sustain yields in rainfed groundnut and castor crops, present experimentation emphasized application of organics to improve soil fertility and drought management ability by recycling crop residues through a simple process of cattle shed bedding. This was an attempt to introduce the practice of cattle shed bedding as value addition to process other locally available crop residues to the practitioners of farming (especially parts of Africa and Latin America).

TI  - Research on the optimumwater content of detecting soil nitrogen using near infrared sensor
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Nitrogen is one of the important indexes to evaluate the physiological and biochemical properties of soil. The level of soil nitrogen content influences the nutrient levels of crops directly. The near infrared sensor can be used to detect the soil nitrogen content rapidly, nondestructively, and conveniently. In order to investigate the effect of the different soil water content on soil nitrogen detection by near infrared sensor, the soil samples were dealt with different drying times and the corresponding water content was measured. The drying time was set from 1 h to 8 h, and every 1 h 90 samples (each nitrogen concentration of 10 samples) were detected. The spectral information of samples was obtained by near infrared sensor, meanwhile, the soil water content was calculated every 1 h. The prediction model of soil nitrogen content was established by two linear modeling methods, including partial least squares (PLS) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE). The experiment shows that the soil has the highest detection accuracy when the drying time is 3 h and the corresponding soil water content is 1.03\%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration set are 0.9721 and 0.9656, and the correlation coefficients of the prediction set are 0.9712 and 0.9682, respectively. The prediction accuracy of both models is high, while the prediction effect of PLS model is better and more stable. The results indicate that the soil water content at 1.03\% has the minimum influence on the detection of soil nitrogen content using a near infrared sensor while the detection accuracy is the highest and the time cost is the lowest, which is of great significance to develop a portable apparatus detecting nitrogen in the field accurately and rapidly.

TI  - Multilayer soil model for improvement of soil moisture estimation using the small perturbation method
VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - A multilayer soil model is presented for improved estimation of soil moisture content using the first-order small perturbation method (SPM) applied to measurements of radar backscattering coefficient. The total reflection coefficient of the natural bare soil including volume scattering contribution is obtained using the multilayer model. The surface reflection terms in SPM model are replaced by the total reflection coefficient from the multilayer soil surface in estimating soil moisture. The difference between the modified SPM model and the original SPM surface model is that the modified SPM model includes both the surface scattering and the volumetric scattering of the natural bare soil. Both the modified SPM model and the original SPM model are tested in soil moisture retrievals using experimental microwave backscattering coefficient data in the literature. Results show that the mean square errors between the measured data and the values estimated by the modified SPM model from all samples are 5.2\%, while errors from the original SPM model are 8.4\%. This indicates that the capability of estimating soil moisture by the SPM model is improved when the surface reflection terms are replaced by the total reflection coefficients of multilayer soil model over bare or very sparsely vegetation covered fields.

TI  - An examination of direct ground wave soil moisture monitoring over an annual cycle of soil conditions
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Direct ground wave (DGW) measurements obtained with ground-penetrating radar have been used in a number of previous studies to estimate volumetric water content in the shallow soil zone; however, these studies have generally involved controlled field experiments or measurements collected across limited natural ranges of soil moisture conditions. To further investigate the capacity of this method, we have undertaken an extensive field study using multifrequency (i.e., 225, 450, and 900 MHz) DGW measurements to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil water content variations typical of midlatitude climates at three sites with different soil textures. The use of common-midpoint surveys allowed us to understand the nature and evolution of the near-surface electromagnetic wavefields and their impact on DGW moisture predictions. We present the novel characterization of a wide-range of seasonal moisture dynamics including soil freezing and thawing process using multifrequency DGW measurements for a range of soil textures. These data showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface wavefield and multifrequency DGW velocities corresponding to both seasonal and shorter-term variations in soil conditions. Although all of the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil water contents, which were controlled by the soil textural properties. Although there were no observed systematic differences in DGW velocities due to frequency dispersion for the 225-900 MHz range, the DGW measurements obtained using higher-frequency antennas was less impacted by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse duration. DGW velocity measurements combined with an appropriate dielectric mixing formula provided quantitative predictions of soil water content that accurately replicated the soil sample data over the annual cycle of moisture conditions.

TI  - A method for soil moisture estimation in {Western} {Africa} based on the {ERS} scatterometer
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - The analysis of feedback phenomena, which occur between continental surfaces and the atmosphere, is one of the keys to an improved understanding of African monsoon dynamics. For this reason, the monitoring of surface parameters, particularly soil moisture, is very important. This paper presents a new methodology for the estimation of surface soil moisture over Western Africa based on the data provided by the European Remote Sensing wind scatterometer instrument, in which an empirical model is used to estimate volumetric soil moisture. This approach takes into account the effects of vegetation and soil roughness in the soil moisture estimation process. The proposed estimations have been validated using different methods, and a good degree of coherence has been observed between satellite estimations and ground truth measurements over the Banizambou site in Niger. Moisture and rainfall estimations for the same site are shown to be strongly correlated. Comparison with the multimodel analysis product provided by the Global Soil Wetness Project, Phase 2, indicates that their estimations are well correlated, although land surface models provide slightly overestimated levels of soil moisture.

TI  - Improving soil moisture profile prediction with the particle filter-{Markov} chain {Monte} {Carlo} method
VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - Satellite soil moisture estimates have received increasing attention over the past decade. This paper examines the applicability of estimating soil moisture states and soil hydraulic parameters through two particle filter (PF) methods: The PF with commonly used sampling importance resampling (PF-SIR) and the PF with recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (PF-MCMC) methods. In a synthetic experiment, the potential of assimilating remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture measurements into a 1-D mechanistic soil water model (HYDRUS-1D) using both the PF-SIR and PF-MCMC algorithms is analyzed. The effects of satellite temporal resolution and accuracy, soil type, and ensemble size on the assimilation of soil moisture are analyzed. In a real data experiment, we first validate the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture products in the Oklahoma Little Washita Watershed. Aside from rescaling the remotely sensed soil moisture, a bias correction algorithm is implemented to correct the deep soil moisture estimate. Both the ascending and descending AMSR-E soil moisture data are assimilated into the HYDRUS-1D model. The synthetic assimilation results indicated that, whereas both updating schemes showed the ability to correct the soil moisture state and estimate hydraulic parameters, the PF-MCMC scheme is consistently more accurate than PR-SIR. For real data case, the quality of remotely sensed soil moisture impacts the benefits of their assimilation into the model. The PF-MCMC scheme brought marginal gains than the open-loop simulation in RMSE at both surface and root-zone soil layer, whereas the PF-SIR scheme degraded the open-loop simulation. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - The impact of vertical measurement depth on the information content of soil moisture times series data
VL  - 41
SN  - 0094-8276
AB  - Using a decade of ground-based soil moisture observations acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture's Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), we calculate the mutual information (MI) content between multiple soil moisture variables and near-future vegetation condition to examine the existence of emergent drought information in vertically integrated (surface to 60 cm) soil moisture observations (theta(0-60) ([cm])) not present in either superficial soil moisture observations (theta(5) ([cm])) or a simple low-pass transformation of theta(5). Results suggest that while theta(0-60) is indeed more valuable than theta(5) for predicting near-future vegetation anomalies, the enhanced information content in theta(0-60) soil moisture can be effectively duplicated by the low-pass transformation of theta(5). This implies that, for drought monitoring applications, the shallow vertical penetration depth of microwave-based theta(5) retrievals does not represent as large a practical limitation as commonly perceived.

VL  - 65

AB  - The conventional gravimetric methods of estimating soil moisture content (Î¸) are laborious, time-consuming, and destructive to agricultural fields. We evaluated the performance of DualEM-II sensor in non-destructive way of Î¸ prediction and for predicting Î¸ variations within potato fields in Atlantic Canada. Values of Î¸ were measured from four potato fields in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island using a pre-calibrated (R2 = 0.98) time domain reflectometry (TDR) from root zone of potato tubers under grid sampling arrangements. Horizontal co-planar (HCP) and perpendicular co-planar (PRP) readings were taken using DualEM-II sensor from the same locations of Î¸ measurements. There was a better correlation between PRP and Î¸ (r: 0.64â€“0.83) was calculated than between HCP and Î¸ (r: 0.41â€“0.79). There was no significant difference (R2: 0.60â€“0.69; RMSE (root mean square error): 2.32â€“4.02) between the Î¸ values measured with TDR (Î¸M) and those predicted with DualEM-II (Î¸P) confirming that the use of electromagnetic induction technique, evaluated during this study, is labor saving, quick, non-destructive, and accurate and can be considered a precision agriculture tool for efficiently managing soil water in potato fields.

TI  - A physically based soil moisture and microwave emissivity data set for global precipitation measurement ({GPM}) applications
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - The joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission will provide considerably more observations over complex and dynamically changing land backgrounds. A physically based precipitation retrieval using GPM's satellite constellation of passive microwave (PMW) observations has to accommodate the spatially and temporally varying radiometric signature of the land surface to constrain the set of candidate rainfall solutions. The challenge for retrieval algorithms is to identify and isolate precipitation profiles whose simulated observations agree with the satellite observations and are also representative of the surface conditions. Microwave emissivity modeling results are presented from a physically based land algorithm that retrieves soil moisture, vegetation water content, and surface temperature, along with the emissivity using polarized 10, 18, and 37 GHz channel measurements from the WindSat sensor onboard the Coriolis satellite, and results from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The emissivity mean, coefficient of variation, covariance, and correlation slope are examined for the range of clear-scene surface properties observed by WindSat and TRMM between 2003-2012 and 2002-2011, respectively, under a range of seasons, time of day, rain events, etc. These joint data provide a means to examine the extent to which the surface geophysical properties control the microwave land surface emissivity covariability, to better utilize these lower frequency observations in overland PMW-based precipitation retrievals.

TI  - Development of a low-cost multi-depth real-time soil moisture sensor using time division multiplexing approach
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an integral parameter for scheduling irrigation. The precise and real-time measurement of SM is difficult due to its complex nature. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether the time division multiplexing (TDM) approach would effectively estimate SM content. We developed a sensor to detect SM from four soil depths (10, 20, 40, and 60 cm) simultaneously by using the TDM technique. This is a type of EM sensor that indirectly estimates the SM on the basis of the dielectric properties of soil. Three types of soil samples were used to calibrate the sensor. The calibration models were established using polynomial (3rd order) fitting equations. The performance of the sensor was evaluated both in the laboratory and in situ conditions. The sensitivity of the sensor was examined in a micro-control irrigation system. The sensor measured SM contents in a soil box were compared with HYDRUS-2D simulated wetting patterns. The results were in the optimal range, and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 and root means square error (RMSE) from 0.72 to 2.01. The TDM detection circuit-based sensor R 2 value was 0.97, and its RMSE was 2.78. Whereas the independent detection circuit R 2 values ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 and RMSE from 4.09 to 5.07. The results determined that the sensor could be used for continuous SM measurements, which would be advantageous for planning the irrigation practices in arid and irrigated regions. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Field level soil moisture variability at 6- and 3-cm sampling depths: {Implications} for microwave sensor validation
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Field-level statistical moments of volumetric soil moisture were compared between the 6- and 3-cm measurement depths. Results are of interest for the ground calibration/validation of microwave remote sensing algorithms, which is commonly performed only at a fixed 6-cm measurement depth. Calibration/validation experiments are critical to developing and testing soil moisture retrieval algorithms from microwave remote sensing platforms. Ground sampling must be optimally designed to minimize sources of error or bias during data collection. An important consideration in the design of ground sampling campaigns is that the in situ measured soil moisture is representative of the retrieval depth of a microwave sensor. Because of the popularity of portable impedance probe instruments, volumetric soil moisture is usually measured at a constant depth of approximately 0 to 6 cm and aggregated over a spatial extent representative of a pixel footprint. However, the retrieval depth of microwave signals can vary, and in agricultural soils is typically representative of the top 5 cm (or less) of the soil surface. It is unknown whether this mismatch between the depth of ground measured soil moisture and microwave retrieved soil moisture significantly contributes to error during sensor calibration/validation. This issue is addressed based on an analysis of over 3400 impedance probe measurements collected in 72 agricultural fields over four sampling occasions. Volumetric soil moisture was measured at depths of approximately 6 and 3 cm, at 24 locations in each field. The observed soil moisture sampling distributions and statistical moments are compared between these two measurement depths. Results demonstrate that the majority of fields exhibit a near-normal sampling distribution at both the 6- (60 of 72) and 3-cm (59 of 72) depths. An average difference of 0.016 m3 m-3 exists between all field means, generally indicating that wetter measurements are observed from the samples at 6 cm than those at 3 cm. Statistically significant differences were found between the measurement depths for field means (23 of 72), distributions (21 of 72), and variances (9 of 72). These findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing near-surface volumetric soil moisture spatial and depth variability effects during ground sampling experiments to minimize error in calibration/validation of retrieval algorithms.

AB  - Within the GLOWA-Danube project, the integrated decision support system DANUBIA was developed to address effects of global change on water resources of the Upper Danube watershed (âˆ¼80,000 km2). Key components of DANUBIA in respect to water quality and plant growth modelling are nitrogen turnover, nitrogen fluxes and storages. This paper discusses an approach to model soil nitrogen dynamics in a mesoscale watershed. Within the model, the soil column is represented by three soil layers. The model components for water fluxes, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen transformation are process-based. To validate the model, field data from four locations were used. Nitrogen modelling results are in good agreement with measured data. Statistical analysis for soil nitrogen and water content resulted in satisfactory indices of agreement. The study demonstrated that the coupled soil moisture and soil nitrogen transformation model is suitable to simulate the fate of mineral nitrogen within the soil profile on the field scale. Sensitivity studies indicate that the model quality for large scale modelling depends particularly upon the appropriate representation of sandy soils, the accurate parameterization of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the precise initialization of soil mineral nitrogen content.

TI  - Analysis of farm-level adoption of soil nutrient management technology by paddy farmers in {Karnataka}, {India
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Adoption of soil test-based nutrient management is important for achieving sustainable development of agriculture. The present study analysed the factors influencing the adoption of soil nutrient management technology package comprising adoption of soil test and recommended fertiliser by paddy farmers in the southern Indian state of Karnataka by using field survey data. Bivariate probit model was used to estimate the sequential adoption decisions on soil test and fertiliser application technologies. The study results showed that farmersâ€™ training on fertiliser application and education had positive and significant effect on adoption of soil nutrient technology package. The likelihood of adoption of soil test technology decreases with increase in distance measured from farm to soil test laboratory. Availability of fewer family labour increases the probability of adoption of soil nutrient management technology. These results have significant policy implications for provision of soil testing facilities nearer to villages and for conducting periodical training programmes for encouraging the farmers to adopt soil test-based nutrient management.

TI  - Mapping variability of soil water content and flux across 1-1000 m scales using the actively heated fiber optic method
VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - The Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO) method is shown to be capable of measuring soil water content several times per hour at 0.25 m spacing along cables of multiple kilometers in length. AHFO is based on distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observation of the heating and cooling of a buried fiberoptic cable resulting from an electrical impulse of energy delivered from the steel cable jacket. The results presented were collected from 750 m of cable buried in three 240 m colocated transects at 30, 60, and 90 cm depths in an agricultural field under center pivot irrigation. The calibration curve relating soil water content to the thermal response of the soil to a heat pulse of 10 W m-1 for 1 min duration was developed in the lab. This calibration was found applicable to the 30 and 60 cm depth cables, while the 90 cm depth cable illustrated the challenges presented by soil heterogeneity for this technique. This method was used to map with high resolution the variability of soil water content and fluxes induced by the nonuniformity of water application at the surface. Â©2014. American Geophysical Union.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture and salinity are two crucial coastal saline soil variables, which influence the soil quality and agricultural productivity in the reclaimed coastal region. Accurately characterizing the spatial variability of these soil parameters is critical for the rational development and utilization of tideland resources. In the present study, the spatial variability of soil moisture and salinity in the reclaimed area of Hangzhou gulf, Shangyu City, Zhejiang Province, China, was detected using the data acquired from radar image and the proximal sensor EM38. Soil moisture closely correlates radar scattering coefficient, and a simplified inversion model was built based on a backscattering coefficient extracted from multi-polarization data of ALOS/PALSAR and in situ soil moisture measured by a time domain reflectometer to detect soil moisture variations. The result indicated a higher accuracy of soil moisture inversion by the HH polarization mode than those by the HV mode. Soil salinity is reflected by soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Further, ECa can be rapidly detected by EM38 equipment in situ linked with GPS for characterizing the spatial variability of soil salinity. Based on the strong spatial variability and interactions of soil moisture and salinity, a cokriging interpolation method with auxiliary variable of backscattering coefficient was adopted to map the spatial variability of ECa. When compared with a map of ECa interpolated by the ordinary kriging method, detail was revealed and the accuracy was increased by 15.3\%. The results conclude that the integrating active remote sensing and proximal sensors EM38 are effective and acceptable approaches for rapidly and accurately detecting soil moisture and salinity variability in coastal areas, especially in the subtropical coastal zones of China with frequent heavy cloud cover.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - A surface soil moisture (SSM) product at a 1-km spatial resolution derived from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Global Monitoring (GM) mode data was evaluated over the entire African continent using coarse spatial resolution SSM acquisitions from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Noah land surface model from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-NOAH). The evaluation was performed in terms of relative soil moisture values (\%), as well as anomalies from the seasonal cycle. Considering the high radiometric noise of the ASAR GM data, the SSM product exhibits a good ability (Pearson correlation coefficient (R) = similar to 0.6 for relative soil moisture values and root mean square difference (RMSD) = 11\% when averaged to 5-km resolution) to monitor temporal soil moisture variability in regions with low to medium density vegetation and yearly rainfall {\textgreater}250 mm. The findings agree with previous evaluation studies performed over Australia and further strengthen the understanding of the quality of the ASAR GM SSM product and its potential for data assimilation. Problems identified in the ASAR GM algorithm over arid regions were explained by azimuthal effects. Diverse backscatter behavior over different soil types was identified. The insights gained about the quality of the data were used to establish a reliable masking of the existing ASAR GM SSM product and the identification of areas where further research is needed for the future Sentinel-1-derived SSM products.

TI  - Permanent-soil monitoring sites for documentation of soil-fertility development after changing from conventional to organic farming
VL  - 169
SN  - NA
AB  - For monitoring soil fertility after changing farm management from highly conventional to organic farming on the newly established research farm of Kassel University, two permanent-soil monitoring sites were installed in 1999. Representative locations for installing the permanent-soil monitoring sites were selected using geographical information systems (GIS), based on available data from geology, topography, soil taxation, land use, and intensive auger-borehole records and analysis with a very high spatial resolution of data. The soils are represented by a Luvisol derived from loess and a Vertisol developed from claystone. The soil properties of the two monitoring sites measured immediately after changing to organic farming showed high contents of extractable nutrients as a result of the former intensive fertilization practice during conventional farm management. The microbial soil properties of the two monitoring sites were in the medium range of regional soils. A first evaluation of the development of soil properties was done after 5 y of monitoring. The soil organic-matter content increased slightly after grass-clover and after application of farmyard manure. The amounts of K and P decreased clearly at the loess site without application of farm-yard manure. At the clay site, the unique application of farm-yard manure led to increasing contents of extractable K and P in the top soil. The variation of soil properties increased clearly after perennial crops like grass-clover and in years after application of farmyard manure. Â© 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.

AB  - Soil moisture is a critical element in the hydrological cycle, which is intimately tied to agriculture production, ecosystem integrity, and hydrological cycle. Point measurements of soil moisture samples are laborious, costly, and inefficient. Remote sensing technologies are capable of conducting soil moisture mapping at the regional scale. The advanced microwave scanning radiometer on earth observing system (AMSR-E) provides global surface soil moisture (SSM) products with the spatial resolution of 25 km which is not sufficient enough to meet the demand for various local-scale applications. This study refines AMSR-E SSM data with normalized multiband drought index (NMDI) derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to provide fused SSM product with finer spatial resolution that can be up to 1 km. Practical implementation of this data fusion method was carried out in Central America Isthmus region to generate the SSM maps with the spatial resolution of 1 km during the dry seasons in 2010 and 2011 for various agricultural applications. The calibration and validation of the SSM maps based on the fused images of AMSR-E and MODIS yielded satisfactory agreement with in situ ground truth data pattern wise.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The paper compares two independent approaches to estimate soil moisture at the regional scale over a 4625 km2 catchment (Liebenbergsvlei, South Africa). The first estimate is derived from a physically-based hydrological model (TOPKAPI). The second estimate is derived from the scatterometer on board the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS). Results show a good correspondence between the modelled and remotely sensed soil moisture, particularly with respect to the soil moisture dynamic, illustrated over two selected seasons of 8 months, yielding regression R2 coefficients lying between 0.68 and 0.92. Such a close similarity between these two different, independent approaches is very promising for (i) remote sensing in general (ii) the use of hydrological models to back-calculate and disaggregate the satellite soil moisture estimate and (iii) for hydrological models to assimilate the remotely sensed soil moisture.

VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - This study demonstrated a new method for mapping high-resolution (spatial: 1 m, and temporal: 1 h) soil moisture by assimilating distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observed soil temperatures at intermediate scales. In order to provide robust soil moisture and property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by maximizing the reliability of the soil temperature estimates of each batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation. Â© 2016.

TI  - Integrated sensing of soil moisture at the field-scale: {Measuring}, modeling and sharing for improved agricultural decision support
VL  - 107
SN  - NA
AB  - Determining the best way to efficiently use limited water resources, for food and energy-dedicated crops, has become crucial due to the rise in extreme events (floods/droughts) and higher variability in rainfall attributed to global climate change. Changing climate conditions will require new crops to be adapted to a changing agricultural environment. Reliable information on seasonal trends in crop growth and evapotranspiration with associated uncertainty/confidence ranges is crucial to guide the development of new crops and management strategies to cope with future climate. Given that crop growth is strongly coupled to soil moisture, developing reliable growth curves requires a detailed understanding of soil moisture at the field-scale. Typically, it is impractical to collect soil samples to adequately assess soil moisture that represents both spatial distribution at the field-scale and temporal dynamics on the scale of a growing season (e.g. 110. days for cereals). A novel way to address soil moisture monitoring challenges is through an integrated, agro-ecosystems-level approach using an integrated sensing system that can link data from multiple platforms (wireless sensors, satellites, airborne imagery, near real-time climate stations). Assimilated data can, then, be fed into predictive models to generate reference crop growth curves and predict regionally-specific yield potentials. However, integrated sensing requires interagency cooperation, common data processing standards and long-term, timely access to data. Large databases need to be reusable by various organizations and accessible, in the future, with comprehensive metadata. During the 2012 growing season a feasibility study was conducted which involved measuring field-scale soil moisture with sensor network technology. The experiment utilized radially-distributed sensors for tracking in-season soil moisture. OpenGIS-compliant services and standards were utilized to provide long-term access to sensor data and construct corresponding metadata. Sensor Model Language, an inter-operable metadata format, was used to create documentation for the sensor system and sensing components. Two different third party implementations of the Sensor Observation Service were tested for providing long-term access to the data. This work discusses a set of key recommendations for monitoring field-scale soil moisture dynamics for integration with remote sensing and models, including: (1) Improved in situ sensing technology that would allow for less restrictive soil moisture measurements. (2) Integration of field-scale in situ networks with regional remote sensing monitoring. (3) The development of software and web services to integrate data from multiple sources with models for decision support. Â© 2014 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Agricultural cyber-physical system: {In}-situ soil moisture and salinity estimation by dielectric mixing
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Integration of cyber technologies with agriculture provides opportunities for precision agriculture. It requires buried underground sensors to provide useful content information to the end-user for crop management. In our earlier studies, we developed an impedance measurement-based in-situ wireless soil moisture and salinity sensor, an electrophoretic sensor for measuring soil ions/nutrients, and nano-patterned plasmonic-resonance, as well as guided-mode resonance-based optical sensors for the plant, released volatile organic compounds. Here we present a physics-based approach to infer the moisture and ionic concentration in the soil from in-situ, multi-frequency measurements of the impedance of a metamaterial-inspired sensing element buried underground. Such model holds the advantage over empirical models by obviating the need to redo the calibration for different soil types. Our method involves performing an inversion analysis on the Bruggeman's dielectric mixing model. Under the quasi-static assumption, the approach predicts volumetric moisture content and ion concentration with 90\% accuracy in terms of the molar fraction of total volume for silver nitrate concentrations of 0 to 100 mM. We observed that soil conductivity is near-linear to the inferred ionic concentration for a given saline water fraction in the soil. The model has been validated by making multi-frequency impedance measurements of a soil mixture at different concentrations comprising of various constituents of soil, air, water, and ions.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring in mountain areas by using high-resolution {SAR} images: {Results} from a feasibility study
VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - Summary: This paper presents the results of a two-year experiment carried out in mountain areas on soil moisture retrieval from remotely sensed images. In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, SÃ¼dtirol region, northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data. This work was carried out with the main aim of demonstrating the feasibility of soil moisture retrieval in mountain areas with high-resolution images in view of the upcoming Sentinel 1 mission.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - The collocation technique has become a popular tool in oceanography and hydrology for estimating the error variances of different data sources such as in situ sensors, models and remote sensing products. It is also possible to determine calibration constants, for example to account for an off-set between the data sources. So far, the temporal autocorrelation structure of the errors has not been studied, although it is known that it has detrimental effects on the results of the collocation technique, in particular when calibration constants are also determined. This paper shows how the (triple) collocation estimators can be adapted to retrieve the autocovariance functions; the statistical properties as well as the structural deficencies are described. The coupling between the autocorrelation of the error and the estimation of calibration constants is studied in detail, due to its importance for analysing temporal changes. In soil moisture applications, such time variations can be induced, for example, by seasonal changes in the vegetation cover, which affect both models and remote sensing products. The limitations of the proposed technique associated with these considerations are analysed using remote sensing and in situ soil moisture data. The variability of the inter-sensor calibration and the autocovariance are shown to be closely related to temporal patterns of the data. Â© 2013 IAHS Press.

TI  - Characterizing soil physical properties for soil moisture monitoring with the {North} {Carolina} environment and climate observing network
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture has important implications for meteorology, climatology, hydrology, and agriculture. This has led to growing interest in development of in situ soil moisture monitoring networks. Measurement interpretation is severely limited without soil property data. In North Carolina, soil moisture has been monitored since 1999 as a routine parameter in the statewide Environment and Climate Observing Network (ECONet), but with little soils information available for ECONet sites. The objective of this paper is to provide soils data for ECONet development. The authors studied soil physical properties at 27 ECONet sites and generated a database with 13 soil physical parameters, including sand, silt, and clay contents; bulk density; total porosity; saturated hydraulic conductivity; air-dried water content; and water retention at six pressures. Soil properties were highly variable among individual ECONet sites [coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging from 12\% to 80\%]. This wide range of properties suggests very different behavior among sites with respect to soil moisture. A principal component analysis indicated parameter groupings associated primarily with soil texture, bulk density, and air-dried water content accounted for 80\% of the total variance in the dataset. These results suggested that a few specific soil properties could be measured to provide an understanding of differences in sites with respect to major soil properties. The authors also illustrate how the measured soil properties have been used to develop new soil moisture products and data screening for the North Carolina ECONet. The methods, analysis, and results presented here have applications to North Carolina and for other regions with heterogeneous soils where soil moisture monitoring is valuable.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of U. P. Council of Sugarcane Research, Shahjahanpur, India for two consecutive years during autumn seasons of 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 to compare modified trench method of sugarcane planting with other prevalent planting methods for its production potentiality and uptake of nutrients and soil fertility status. The experiment consisting of five planting method treatments viz., conventional furrow planting at 90 cm apart (T1), deep furrow (20 cm) planting at 90 cm apart covering setts with 2. 5 cm of soil layer (T2), paired row furrow planting at 120:60:120 cm (T3), paired row deep furrow (20 cm) planting at 120:60:120 cm covering setts with 2. 5 cm of soil layer (T4) and modified trench planting at 120 cm apart placing setts across the furrow and covering them with 2. 5 cm of soil layer (T5) was laid out in randomized block design with five replications. Experimental results revealed that cane yield obtained under modified trench method of planting was 18. 72, 23. 87, 21. 22, and 27. 01 \% higher than that of T4, T3, T2, and T1 treatments, respectively. Significantly highest uptake of N, P, and K (168. 60, 87. 31, and 254. 46 kg/ha, respectively) was noticed under modified trench method of planting. The soil fertility status of soil observed initially and after the harvest of sugarcane crop clearly indicated positive effect of modified trench method of planting on soil fertility status. Thus, a favourable soil fertility helped better uptake of nutrients and cane growth, which ultimately resulted in higher cane yield under modified trench method of sugarcane planting.

VL  - 114
SN  - 0011-3891
AB  - Soil fertility has direct implications on the agricultural production scenarios of a region. Surface soil samples at 1 km grid were collected to assess the fertility status of Lakhimpur district (Assam) in North East India. Fertility parameters like soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, zinc and copper were determined using standard analytical procedure. Spatial distribution maps of the soil parameters were generated using regularized spline method in ArcGIS 10.0. The average soil organic carbon content was 1.05\% and the maximum area was under high availability status (78\%). In the case of nitrogen, 57\% of the area was under low availability status. In the case of available potassium and phosphorus, the areas under low availability status were 48\% and 49\% respectively. But for micronutrients, in general, the availability status was high except for zinc, which indicated that 40\% of the area was under low availability. A methodology was developed to integrate the individual nutrient layers using a set of decision rules to identify the multinutrient deficient zones. The integrated map showed that 24\% of the area had multiple nutrient deficiencies and fell under high priority zone that warrant immediate nutrient management interventions to mitigate the situation.

TI  - A horizontal mobile dielectric sensor to assess dynamic soil water content and flows: {Direct} measurements under drip irrigation compared with {HYDRUS}-{2D} model simulation
VL  - 179
SN  - NA
AB  - The HYDRUS-2D simulation software has been used for irrigation management. Its performance under realistic irrigation regimes requires evaluation with new methodologies that integrate larger soil volumes, because soil water content is highly variable in time, space and scale. We compare direct measurements in a sloping field environment under drip irrigation with simulation using HYDRUS-2D. An advanced mobile sensor technology is used to track the dynamics of soil water content, and thus of unsaturated flow, at 0.25 m and 0.50 m depth in a field plot (6 m Ã— 3 m; 4Â° slope) beneath two parallel (0.5 m separation; 7 emitters per delivery tube) dripper arrays. We document an asynchronous sequence of wetting fronts driven by the sloping surface and capture the field results well using HYDRUS-2D, in the spatial (R 2 = 0.935â€“0.963, p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 0.024â€“0.027 cm 3 cm âˆ’3 ) and time (R 2 = 0.804â€“0.983, p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 0.9â€“1.8 h) domains. In general, the HYDRUS-2D simulation system has potentially excellent capability for characterizing temporal moisture redistribution, tracking wetting front dynamics and predicting the time required for volumetric soil water content (VSWC) to reach field capacity under drip irrigation. Moreover, our study showed that the mobile dielectric sensor is a powerful tool to monitor infiltration of drip array irrigation both in spatial and time domains. Â© 2018 IAgrE

TI  - Hyperspectral measurements of wet, dry and saline soils from the {McMurdo} {Dry} {Valleys}: {Soil} moisture properties from remote sensing
VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a spatially heterogeneous quantity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica that exerts a large influence on the biological community and on the thermal state of Dry Valleys permafrost. The goal of this project was to determine whether hyperspectral remote sensing techniques could be used to determine soil moisture conditions in the Dry Valleys. We measured the spectral reflectance factors of wetted soil samples from the Dry Valleys under natural light conditions and related diagnostic spectral features to surface layer soil moisture content. Diagnostic water absorption features in the spectra at 1.4 Ã‚m and 1.9 Ã‚m were present in all samples, including samples doped with high concentrations of chloride salts. The depth of the 1.4 Ã‚m absorption is shown to increase linearly with increasing gravimetric water content. These results suggest that airborne hyperspectral imaging of the Dry Valleys could generate soil moisture maps of this environment over large spatial areas using non-invasive remote-sensing techniques.

TI  - An intercomparison of available soil moisture estimates from thermal infrared and passive microwave remote sensing and land surface modeling
VL  - 116
SN  - NA
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture studies have mainly focused on retrievals using active and passive microwave (MW) sensors, which provide measurements that are directly related to soil moisture (SM). MW sensors have obvious advantages such as the ability to retrieve through nonprecipitating cloud cover which provides shorter repeat cycles. However, MW sensors offer coarse spatial resolution and suffer from reduced retrieval skill over moderate to dense vegetation. A unique avenue for filling these information gaps is to exploit the retrieval of SM from thermal infrared (TIR) observations, which can provide SM information under vegetation cover and at significantly higher resolutions than MW. Previously, an intercomparison of TIR-based and MW-based SM has not been investigated in the literature. Here a series of analyses are proposed to study relationships between SM products during a multiyear period (2003-2008) from a passive MW retrieval (AMSR-E), a TIR based model (ALEXI), and a land surface model (Noah) over the continental United States. The three analyses used in this study include (1) a spatial anomaly correlation analysis, (2) a temporal correlation analysis, and (3) a triple collocation error estimation technique. In general, the intercomparison shows that the TIR and MW methods provide complementary information about the current SM state. TIR can provide SM information over moderate to dense vegetation, a large information gap in current MW methods, while serving as an additional independent source of SM information over low to moderate vegetation. The complementary nature of SM information from MW and TIR sensors implies a potential for integration within an advanced SM data assimilation system.

TI  - Contribution of red alder to soil nitrogen input in a silvopastoral system
VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - Studies on Alnus rubra Bong. (red alder) were carried out to assess its potential for use as a component of a silvopastoral system. Comparison was between two treatments: red alder at 400 stems ha-1 (silvopasture) and red alder at 2,500 stems ha-1 (forestry control). Î´15N values close to zero were recorded in all red alder plant parts except for root nodules, indicating that a large proportion of N in red alder was fixed from the atmosphere. Overall, it was estimated that there was 63.45 kg N ha-1 fixed N accumulated in red alder trees, and the rate of N fixation was estimated at 30.95 kg ha-1 year-1 in the silvopasture treatment. The total amount of N that could potentially be added to the soil in the silvopasture treatment as a result of decomposition of senescent leaves, roots, and dead nodules was estimated at 40.56 kg ha -1 year-1. Of the total N added to the soil, 27.1 kg ha-1 year-1 was due to N fixation from the atmosphere. These results show that red alder has a potential to improve and maintain soil fertility in a silvopastoral system. Â© 2007 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Soil moisture and thermal behavior in the vicinity of buried objects affecting remote sensing detection: {Experimental} and modeling investigation
VL  - 51
SN  - NA
AB  - Improvements in buried mine detection using remote sensing technology rest on understanding the effects on sensor response of spatial and temporal variability created by soil and environmental conditions. However, research efforts on mine detection have generally emphasized sensor development, while less effort has been made to evaluate the effects of the environmental conditions in which the mines are placed. If the processes governing moisture and temperature distribution near the ground surface can be captured, sensor development and deployment can be more realistically tailored to particular operational scenarios and technologies. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the soil environment on landmine detection by studying the influence of the thermal boundary conditions at the landatmosphere interface and the buried objects themselves on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture around shallow-buried objects. Two separate large tank experiments were performed with buried objects with different thermal properties. Experimental results were compared to results from a fully coupled heat and mass transfer numerical model. Comparison of experimental and numerical results suggests that the vapor enhancement factor used to adjust the vapor diffusive flux described based on Fick's law is not necessary under dry soil conditions. Data and simulations from this study show that the thermal signature of a buried object depends on the complex interaction among a soil's water content and its thermal and hydraulic properties. Simulated thermal and saturation contrasts were generally very different for a buried landmine than for other buried objects. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring of stem water content of native and invasive trees in arid environments using {GS3} soil moisture sensors
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Dielectric soil moisture sensors have the potential for nondestructive and real-time monitoring of the stem water content (Î¸st) of living trees. This study was conducted to investigate the water use characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of Î¸st using newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species. Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of Î¸st caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of Î¸st in arid environments. The Î¸st of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The Î¸st of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The Î¸st of the tamarisk decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.

TI  - A novel soil nutrient detection method based on combined {ATR} and {DRIFT} mid-infrared spectra
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Conventional soil nutrient detection methods are time-consuming and laborious and cannot realize rapid measurement. Mid-infrared spectroscopy with the advantages of high detection speed, non-destructive testing, and a pretreatment-free process has been widely applied in soil nutrient analysis. In previous studies on the detection of soil compositions, diffuse reflection and attenuated total reflection are two commonly adopted ways in mid-infrared spectroscopy. In this paper, we developed a method which could simultaneously measure the infrared attenuated total reflection (ATR) and diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of soils, in order to obtain more abundant spectral information. We analyzed and predicted the contents of organic matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen quantitatively in soils by using chemometrics. The results showed that after combining ATR spectra and DRIFT spectra, the MSC-processed PLS models allowed a higher prediction accuracy than that of using ATR or DRIFT spectra alone. The coefficients of determination of organic matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen models were 0.93, 0.952 and 0.971, respectively. By combining ATR and DRIFT spectral information, the analytical ability of infrared spectroscopy was enhanced. This study provided a new method for the rapid measurement of soil nutrients.

TI  - Comparative assessment of soil moisture estimation from land surface model and satellite remote sensing based on catchment water balance
VL  - 21
SN  - 1350-4827
AB  - Land surface models and satellite remote sensing are among the modern soil moisture retrieval techniques that can be used over large areas. However, the lack of `ground truth' soil moisture measurements is still an obstacle in the evaluation and validation of soil moisture retrievals. In this study, a new scheme is used to assess soil moisture retrieval from both the NOAH Land surface Model (LSM) coupled with the fifth generation Mesoscale Model MM5 and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer AMSR-E. The proposed scheme is based on the strong correlation between changes in soil storage from rainfall runoff events and changes in the retrieved soil moisture either from the MM5-NOAH LSM or the AMSR-E. The aim of this study is to compare the application of the proposed scheme between these two different approaches for soil moisture estimation. The MM5-NOAH LSM provides soil moisture estimations at three different layers with depths 0-10 cm (surface layer 1), 10-40 cm (layer 2) and 40-100 cm (layer 3). In this study, the combined soil moisture over the top two layers (first and second) and the combined soil moisture over the first three layers (first, second and third) are used to account for the entire soil column for assessing the estimated soil moisture using changes in the storage from the water balance. The results have shown that the MM5 soil moisture from the combined top two layers has the better performance than either of the individual layers when compared to the catchment water storage. The results also show that the MM5-NOAH LSM soil moisture estimates have a slightly better performance than the AMSR-E surface soil moisture measurement. This preliminary assessment shows the benefits of using hydrological data in the validation of soil moisture retrieval methods.

TI  - A combined modeling and multipectral/multiresolution remote sensing approach for disaggregation of surface soil moisture: {Application} to {SMOS} configuration
VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - A new physically based disaggregation method is developed to improve the spatial resolution of the surface soil moisture extracted from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data. The approach combines the 40-km resolution SMOS multiangular brightness temperatures and 1-km resolution auxiliary data composed of visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing data and all the surface variables involved in the modeling of land surface-atmosphere interaction available at this scale (soil texture, atmospheric forcing, etc.). The method successively estimates a relative spatial distribution of soil moisture with fine-scale auxiliary data, and normalizes this distribution at SMOS resolution with SMOS data. The main assumption relies on the relationship between the radiometric soil temperature inverted from the thermal infrared and the microwave soil moisture. Based on synthetic data generated with a land surface model, it is shown that the radiometric soil temperature can be used as a tracer of the spatial variability of the 0-5 cm soil moisture. A sensitivity analysis shows that the algorithm remains stable for big uncertainties in auxiliary data and that the uncertainty in SMOS observation seems to be the limiting factor. Finally, a simple application to the SGP97/AVHRR data illustrates the usefulness of the approach. Â© 2005 IEEE.

VL  - 5
SN  - 2072-4292
AB  - Understanding the hydrological dynamics of boreal wetland ecosystems (peatlands) is essential in order to better manage hydropower inter-annual productivity at the La Grande basin (Northern Quebec, QC, Canada). Given the remoteness and the huge dimension of the La Grande basin, it is imperative to develop remote sensing monitoring techniques to retrieve hydrological parameters. The main objective of this study is to find out if multi-date and multi-polarization Radar Satellite 2 (RADARSAT-2) (C-band) image analysis could detect seasonal variations of surface soil moisture conditions of the acrotelm. A change detection approach through the use of multi temporal indexes was chosen based on the assumption that the temporal variability of surface roughness and natural vegetation biomass is generally at a much longer time scale than that of surface soil moisture (-Index is based on a reference image that represents dry soil, in order to maximize the sensitivity of sigma degrees to changes in soil moisture with respect to the same location when soil is wet). The -Index approach was tested with each polarization: sigma degrees for fully polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VV) and the cross-polarization coefficient (HV/HH). Results show that the best regression adjustment with regard to surface soil moisture content in boreal wetlands was obtained with the cross-polarization coefficient. The cross-polarization multi-temporal index enables precise volumetric surface soil moisture estimation and monitoring on boreal wetlands, regardless of the influence of vegetation cover and surface roughness conditions (bias was under 1\%, standard deviation and RMSE were under 10\% for almost all estimation errors). Surface soil moisture estimation was more precise over permanently flooded areas than seasonally flooded ones (standard deviation is systematically greater for the seasonally flooded areas, at all analyzed scales), although the overall quality of the estimation is still precise. Cross-polarization ratio image analysis appears to be a useful mean to exploit radar data spatially, as we were able to relate changes in wetland eco-hydrological dynamics to variations in the intensity of the ratio.

TI  - Soil moisture variations monitoring by {AMSU}-based soil wetness indices: {A} long-term inter-comparison with ground measurements
VL  - 114
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture controls the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration and, consequently, the runoff generation. On the catchment scale its routine monitoring can be performed through remote sensing technologies. Within this framework, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), radiometer on board the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellites and operating since 1998, for the assessment of soil wetness conditions by comparing soil moisture data with both those measured in situ and provided by a continuous rainfall-runoff model applied to four catchments located in the Upper Tiber River (Central Italy). In particular, in order to perform a robust analysis an extensive and long-term period (nine years) of data was investigated. In detail, the Soil Wetness Variation Index, derived from the AMSU data modified in order to take account of the difference between the soil layer investigated by the satellite sensor and that used as a benchmark, was found to be correlated both with the in-situ and modeled soil moisture variations showing correlation coefficients in the range of 0.42-0.49 and 0.33-0.48, respectively. As far as the soil moisture temporal pattern is concerned, higher correlations were obtained (0.59-0.84 for the in-situ data and 0.82-0.87 for the modeled data set) partly due to the soil moisture seasonal pattern that enhances the correlation. Overall, the root mean square error was found to be less than 0.05m3/m3 for both the comparisons, thus assessing the potential of the AMSU sensor to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture temporal patterns. Moreover, the AMSU sensor can be considered as a useful tool to provide a reliable and frequently updated global soil moisture data set, considering its higher temporal resolution now available (about 4 passes per day) thanks to the presence of the sensor aboard different satellites.

TI  - Lacandon {Maya} traditional ecological knowledge and rainforest restoration: {Soil} fertility beneath six agroforestry system trees
VL  - 92
SN  - NA
AB  - The swidden agroforestry system of the Lacandon Maya has allowed them to sustainably manage their land for hundreds of years without observed soil degradation. Lacandon land managers plant and care for many particular tree species during the fallow period of their multi-successional swidden system to facilitate the restoration of soil fertility. Soil samples were taken around six of tree species (Poulsenia armata, Cedrela odorata, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Swietenia macrophylla, Lonchocarpus guatemalensis, and Heliocarpus appendiculatus) in different-aged sites to evaluate their effect on soil fertility. Soil nutrient levels increased in the later successional stages of the Lacandon agroforestry system. Available phosphorus was elevated in soils beneath P. armata, C. odorata, and L. guatemalensis trees, and decreased with distance away from the trunk. L. guatemalensis presented similar effects with total nitrogen and soil organic matter content. These results demonstrate that Lacandon Maya agroforestry management choices relate positively to soil restoration. This TEK could lend guidance to countering the ecological degradation of the surrounding Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve region and for other humid Neotropical lowland forests. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Earthworms, soil fertility and aggregate-associated soil organic matter dynamics in the {Quesungual} agroforestry system
VL  - 155
SN  - NA
AB  - Issues of food security, environmental degradation and global climate change underscore the need for the improved understanding of sustainable agricultural systems around the globe. The Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) of western Honduras offers a promising alternative to traditional slash-and-burn (SB) agriculture for the mountainous tropical dry forest zones of Central America, but the overall influence of this system on soils is not fully understood. We examined earthworm populations, soil fertility and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics under QSMAS and SB agriculture, with secondary forest (SF) as a reference. Both QSMAS and SB consisted of treatments with and without inorganic fertilizer (N-P-K) additions, resulting in five management treatments, each present on three replicate farms. Baseline soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected prior to forest clearing and establishment of QSMAS plots in 2003 and in SB and SF plots in 2005 to determine initial soil concentrations of C and N. Soils were sampled in 2006 and 2007 for bulk soil C and N and P availability, as well as for aggregate fractionation and determination of C and N within the different aggregate size fractions. Earthworm populations were assessed in July 2007. Earthworm numbers and biomass were higher under QSMAS than under SB (13.4 vs. 0.8 g fresh biomass m- 2; respectively). Significant interactions between cropping system and fertilization suggest that QSMAS increased the availability of added inorganic P, 3 times more under QSMAS than for SB. Comparisons with SF, indicated that both cropping systems resulted in a dramatic loss of C (average 5 g C kg- 1 soil) since treatment implementation, and that this loss was mainly associated with the disruption of C rich large macroaggregates ({\textgreater} 2000 Î¼m). After taking into account baseline soil C differences between plots, no major differences in total SOM losses were found between QSMAS and SB management. However, earlier establishment of QSMAS plots suggests that the overall rate of C loss since treatment establishment was lower for QSMAS than for SB. Results from this study suggest that the Quesungual agroforestry system offers great potential to improve soil fertility and biological health in the region relative to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture.

TI  - Biochar use in a legumeâ€“rice rotation system: effects on soil fertility and crop performance
VL  - 62
SN  - NA
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether by applying biochar, it is possible to augment the beneficial effects of legumeâ€“crop rotation systems on soil fertility and crop performance. Repeated experiments were established in 2012 and 2013 in South-western Benin using a split-split plot design. Two legumes, Mucuna pruriens (mucuna) and Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), were planted for 42 days on biochar-amended and unamended plots and subsequently cut and applied as mulch 5 days before planting rice. Rice plants were either fertilized or not using a fertilizer rate of 60, 30, and 30 kg haâˆ’1 of N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively. The results showed that the application of legume green manures and fertilizer, either singly or in combination, improved soil nutrient availability, CEC, shoot yield, and grain yield of rice on both biochar-amended and unamended plots. However, the effect was significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) greater on biochar-amended plots. The mean grain yield for all cropping seasons was 1.8 t haâˆ’1 for biochar-amended plots and 1.3 t haâˆ’1 for unamended plots. The greater grain yield of rice on biochar-amended plots was associated with improved soil fertility and increased N uptake. Â© 2015 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Reconstruction of {GF}-1 {Soil} {Moisture} {Observation} {Based} on {Satellite} and {In} {Situ} {Sensor} {Collaboration} under {Full} {Cloud} {Contamination
VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Clouds often limit the ability of optical satellite sensors (such as the newly launched Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite in China) to observe regional soil moisture at high spatial resolutions, especially under full-cloud-contamination condition. Thus, accurate reconstruction of regional soil moisture in this case became a great methodological challenge because of the complexity and ill-posed nature of the problem. In this paper, we present a Satellite and In situ sensor Collaborated Reconstruction (SICR) method. In this method, four reconstruction rules were proposed to rebuild four kinds of corresponding missing pixels, defined as follows: C1 pixel (including one in situ sensor in its area), C2 pixel (physically similar to C1), C3 pixel (with a regular soil moisture observation sequence), and C4 pixel (remaining). By analyzing soil moisture observation relationships between these four types of pixels with in situ measurements and within these pixels, four numerical reconstruction rules were established. Linear regression, similar pixel determination, least square method, and geostatistical interpolation algorithms were used in these four rules. At last, all blank soil moisture pixels in the target soil moisture image can be filled by the SICR method. The experiment conducted in the central south of U.S. integrated 11 in situ soil moisture sensors from the United States Department of Agriculture with 11 GF-1 satellite soil moisture images. It was demonstrated that GF-1 soil moisture observations on October 17, 2014, were successfully reconstructed by the SICR method, based on the evaluations of visual appearance comparison, error distribution analysis, subimage comparison, average relative error, and universal image quality index. SICR also performed better than the reconstruction results only based on in situ or satellite sensor data. Moreover, the comparison with the soil moisture observation from the microwave sensor demonstrated the value of SICR in regional high-resolution soil moisture reconstruction. It was suggested that the SICR method provided an effective reconstruction method under full cloud contamination and showed great potential for collaborating satellite and in situ sensors.

TI  - Comparison of near infrared and mid infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for field-scale measurement of soil fertility parameters
VL  - 171
SN  - NA
AB  - Data-intensive technologies such as precision agriculture require new approaches for acquisition of soil data on landscapes. We compared the ability of near infrared (NIR; 400-2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR; 2,500-25,000 nm) spectroscopy for field-scale acquisition of soil fertility parameters. Samples were obtained in a grid pattern (25 m spacing) from the surface (0-10 cm) and sub-surface (10-30 cm) samples collected at 272 locations. Samples were analyzed for organic C and total N, texture (clay, silt, and sand), soil pH, and Mehlich I extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P. We found that chemometric analyses NIR and MIR provided good calibrations for organic carbon, total N, and soil texture. To varying degrees of precision, these regions also calibrated for pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Exchangeable P did not form useful calibrations in either spectral region. In all cases, MIR calibrations were better than those formed in the NIR region. Test of calibrations based on one-third of the samples was used to predict the remaining samples. This demonstrated the strategy of developing field-scale calibrations for the spectral regions by chemical analysis of a small sub-set of samples for the prediction of large numbers of samples. This approach can be used to accurately map the spatial distribution of soil properties within agricultural landscapes. These studies demonstrate the utility of infrared spectral approaches for generating the spatial soil properties data needed to implement precision agriculture technology.

TI  - The {Evaluation} of {Single}-{Sensor} {Surface} {Soil} {Moisture} {Anomalies} over the {Mainland} of the {People}'s {Republic} of {China
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - In recent years, different space agencies have launched satellite missions that carry passive microwave instruments on-board that can measure surface soil moisture. Three currently operational missions are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) from China's National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC). In this study, the quality of surface soil moisture anomalies derived from these passive microwave instruments was sequentially assessed over the mainland of the People's Republic of China. First, the impact of a recent update in the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was assessed for MWRI observations. Then, the soil moisture measurements retrieved from the X-band observations of MWRI were compared with those of AMSR2, followed by an internal comparison of the multiple frequencies of AMSR2. Finally, SMOS retrievals from two different algorithms were also included in the comparison. For each sequential step, processing and verification chains were specifically designed to isolate the impact of algorithm (version), observation frequency or instrument characteristics. Two verification techniques are used: the statistical Triple Collocation technique is used as the primary verification tool, while the precipitation-based Rvalue technique is used to confirm key results. Our results indicate a consistently better performance throughout the entire study area after the implementation of an update of the LPRM. We also find that passive microwave observations in the AMSR2 C-band frequency (6.9 GHz) have an advantage over the AMSR2 X-band frequency (10.7 GHz) over moderate to densely vegetated regions. This finding is in line with theoretical expectations as emitted soil radiation will become masked under a dense canopy with stricter thresholds for higher passive microwave frequencies. Both AMSR2 and MWRI make X-band observations; a direct comparison between them reveals a consistently higher quality obtained by AMSR2, specifically over semi-arid climate regimes. Unfortunately, Radio Frequency Interference hampers the usefulness of soil moisture products for the SMOS L-band mission, leading to a significantly reduced revisit time over the densely populated eastern part of the country. Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture products from a number of multi-frequency microwave sensors are credible alternatives for this dedicated L-band mission over the mainland of the People's Republic of China.

TI  - Method for soil moisture and surface temperature estimation in the tibetan plateau using spaceborne radiometer observations
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - A method for soil moisture and surface temperature estimation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using spaceborne radiometer observations was presented. Based on the physical basis that the 36.5-GHz (Ka-band) vertical brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the topsoil temperature, a new surface temperature model was developed using all ground measurements available from three networks named CAMP/Tibet, Maqu, and Naqu, established in the TP, which can significantly improve the accuracy of surface temperature derived from the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Then, the new surface temperature model, which was calibrated with in situ data, was integrated into the soil moisture retrieval algorithm proposed in this letter using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) observations. The algorithm combines the vegetation optical depth and roughness into an integrated factor to avoid making unreliable assumptions and using auxiliary data to get these two parameters. Finally, the algorithm was validated by ground measurements from the dense Naqu network and was compared with NASA AMSR-E and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) official algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can provide much more accurate soil moisture retrievals than the other two satellite algorithms in the Naqu network region. The algorithm can be applied to the areas with spare vegetation but may not be very suitable for densely vegetated surfaces. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Effects of slope position, aspect and cropping system on soil nutrient variability in hilly areas
VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - Human activities and topography are main factors affecting soil nutrient variation. However, the relationships between these factors are both site- and scale-specific. In hilly areas of south-western China, the dominant cropping systems are rice, vegetables, oranges, Chinese red pepper and maize-sweet potato intercropping. In the present study, slope position (valley, low slope, flat slope, middle slope, upper slope, ridge) and aspect (north, east, south, west) were derived to investigate the relationships among cropping system, terrain, and soil nutrients at county scale. Crops were mainly planted at middle or flat slope positions. Rice and orange plants were evenly distributed across the aspects whereas vegetables were mostly planted on the northern aspect. Red pepper and maize-sweet potato plants were mainly grown on the western and southern aspects. Rice sites had higher contents of organic matter and available nitrogen (N) and lower contents of available phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K). For dryland cropping systems, vegetable sites had higher contents of organic matter, available N, and available P. Red pepper sites had higher contents of available K. Contents of organic matter and available N were generally higher at lower landscape positions. Contents of available K were higher at lower and flat slope positions. Contents of available P were higher at higher landscape positions. Contents of organic matter and available N were higher on the northern and eastern, and lower on the western aspects. Contents of available P were higher on the western and lower on the northern aspects. No significant differences were found for available K across the aspects. Classification tree algorithms indicated that relative importance of the variables on soil nutrient variation was in the order: (i) cropping system, (ii) slope position, and (iii) aspect.

TI  - Influence of trees on soil nutrient pools in a silvopastoral system in the {Brazilian} {Savannah
VL  - 329
SN  - NA
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been suggested as an approach to reduce pasture degradation and, consequently, reduce the deforestation of new areas in the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). This study assessed the contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 19Â° 35â€² 36â€³ S, 43Â° 51â€² 56â€³ W; altitude 747 m. The SPS has developed since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees ha-1. The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+). In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole. In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree, forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are unlikely. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

TI  - Sensing landscape level change in soil fertility following deforestation and conversion in the highlands of {Madagascar} using {Vis}-{NIR} spectroscopy
VL  - 133
SN  - NA
AB  - Research data on soil quality are scarce in Madagascar, despite the island's widely recognized problems of soil and environmental degradation. One of the major constraints to properly assessing current status, trends and processes of soil degradation is the high level of costs involved when using conventional soil analytical methods. Previous studies have demonstrated that visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) reflectance spectroscopy may permit rapid and cost effective analysis of tropical soils that could provide new opportunities for farmers, land managers, local authorities and researchers in assessing and managing soil quality. This study tested the potential of Vis-NIR soil spectral libraries for predicting and mapping soil properties in the eastern highlands of Madagascar. Stable calibration models were developed for several key soil properties. Cross-validated r2 values were soil organic carbon (SOC), 0.94; total nitrogen (TN), 0.96; and cation exchange capacity (CEC), 0.80. A spectral soil fertility index (SFI) was developed based on ten commonly used agronomic indicators of soil fertility. SFI varied significantly with current and historic land use. The index was successfully calibrated to both soil reflectance measured in the laboratory (p = 0.003) and Landsat TM reflectance (p = 0.003), which permitted mapping of the index.

TI  - A coupling model for soil moisture retrieval in sparse vegetation covered areas based on microwave and optical remote sensing data
VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important component of natural water cycles and plays a crucial role for the healthy development of ecological environment in arid and semiarid areas. Microwave remote sensing techniques are promising to rapidly monitor regional soil moisture. However, major difficulties associated with retrieving soil moisture via microwave remote sensing are attributed to effects of surface roughness and vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potentials of combined roughness parameters and develop a model that mostly relies on the satellite data and requires minimum a priori information for soil moisture inversion over sparse vegetation covered areas through combing Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GF-1 data. For the purpose, the impacts of vegetation on the radar backscattering coefficient were removed by the water-cloud model (WCM) and a new roughness parameter Zs (Zs = S3/L is defined as a combined roughness parameter) was proposed by simulating relationships between surface roughness parameters, soil moisture, and backscattering coefficients using advanced integral equation model (AIEM). On the basis, a coupling model of soil moisture inversion for blown-wind areas of the Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China, was in turn developed with Radarsat-2 HH and VV polarization data, and the soil moisture content (SMC) values for sparse vegetation covered surfaces were retrieved with limited use of in situ roughness parameters. The in situ measurements and satellite data set were used to validate the reliability of the developed model. The results showed that the retrieved soil moisture levels fell below in situ soil moisture levels before the vegetation effect was removed, and the precision of retrieved soil moisture was effectively improved when the vegetation effect was corrected by the WCM, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error decreasing from 7.45\% and 6.24\% to 5.12\% and 3.44\%, respectively. According to the map of retrieved soil moisture levels generated for the study area, most of SMCs were below 35\% in accordance with field observations. These study results can serve as a foundation for monitoring soil moisture and water environments in arid and semiarid regions. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - L band microwave remote sensing and land data assimilation improve the representation of prestorm soil moisture conditions for hydrologic forecasting
VL  - 44
SN  - 0094-8276
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing and land data assimilation purport to improve the quality of antecedent soil moisture information available for operational hydrologic forecasting. We objectively validate this claim by calculating the strength of the relationship between storm-scale runoff ratio (i.e., total streamflow divided by total rainfall accumulation in depth units) and prestorm surface soil moisture estimates from a range of surface soil moisture data products. Results demonstrate that both satellite-based, L band microwave radiometry and the application of land data assimilation techniques have significantly improved the utility of surface soil moisture data sets for forecasting streamflow response to future rainfall events. Plain Language Summary Forecasting streamflow conditions is important for minimizing loss of life and property during flooding and adequately planning for low streamflow conditions accompanying drought. One way to improve these forecasts is measuring the amount of water in the soilsince soil moisture conditions determine what fraction of rainfall will run off horizontally into stream channels (versus vertically infiltrate into the soil column). Within the past 5years, there have been important advances in our ability to monitor soil moisture over large scales using both satellite-based sensors and the application of new land data assimilation techniques. This paper illustrates that these advances have significantly improved our capacity to forecast how much streamflow will be generated by future precipitation events. These results may eventually be used by operational forecasters to improve flash flood forecasting and agricultural water use management.

VL  - 8
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - This paper presents an approach for retrieval of soil moisture content (SMC) from different satellite sensors with a focus on mountain areas. The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper selection of input features. During the result analysis, several algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out on images acquired over the SÃ¼dtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during 2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements, resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045 to 0.07 m3/m3. Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m3/m3 for both satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal dynamics.

VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and water content (WC) in the root zone are two major hydro-meteorological parameters that exhibit a dominant control on water, energy and carbon fluxes, and are therefore important for any regional eco-hydrological or climatological study. To investigate the potential for retrieving these parameter from hyperspectral remote sensing, we have investigated plant spectral reflectance (400-2,500 nm, ASD FieldSpec3) for two major agricultural crops (sugar beet and spring barley) in the mid-latitudes, treated under different water and nitrogen (N) conditions in a greenhouse experiment over the growing period of 2008. Along with the spectral response, we have measured soil water content and LAI for 15 intensive measurement campaigns spread over the growing season and could demonstrate a significant response of plant reflectance characteristics to variations in water content and nutrient conditions. Linear and non-linear dimensionality analysis suggests that the full band reflectance information is well represented by the set of 28 vegetation spectral indices (SI) and most of the variance is explained by three to a maximum of eight variables. Investigation of linear dependencies between LAI and soil WC and pre-selected SI's indicate that: (1) linear regression using single SI is not sufficient to describe plant/soil variables over the range of experimental conditions, however, some improvement can be seen knowing crop species beforehand; (2) the improvement is superior when applying multiple linear regression using three explanatory SI's approach. In addition to linear investigations, we applied the non-linear CART (Classification and Regression Trees) technique, which finally did not show the potential for any improvement in the retrieval process.

TI  - Combined use of optical and radar satellite data for the monitoring of irrigation and soil moisture of wheat crops
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of this study is to get a better understanding of radar signal over irrigated wheat fields and to assess the potentialities of radar observations for the monitoring of soil moisture. Emphasis is put on the use of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data (Envisat/ASAR and Formosat-2). Time series of images were collected over the Yaqui irrigated area (Mexico) throughout one agricultural season from December 2007 to May 2008, together with measurements of soil and vegetation characteristics and agricultural practices. The comprehensive analysis of these data indicates that the sensitivity of the radar signal to vegetation is masked by the variability of soil conditions. On-going irrigated areas can be detected all over the wheat growing season. The empirical algorithm developed for the retrieval of topsoil moisture from Envisat/ASAR images takes advantage of the Formosat-2 instrument capabilities to monitor the seasonality of wheat canopies. This monitoring is performed using dense time series of images acquired by Formosat-2 to set up the SAFY vegetation model. Topsoil moisture estimates are not reliable at the timing of plant emergence and during plant senescence. Estimates are accurate from tillering to grain filling stages with an absolute error about 9\% (0.09 m3 m-3, 35\% in relative value). This result is attractive since topsoil moisture is estimated at a high spatial resolution (i.e. over subfields of about 5 ha) for a large range of biomass water content (from 5 and 65 t ha-1 independently from the viewing angle of ASAR acquisition (incidence angles IS1 to IS6).

TI  - Trace element concentration in wheat grain: {Results} from the {Swedish} long-term soil fertility experiments and national monitoring program
VL  - 31
SN  - NA
AB  - Concentrations of trace elements in wheat grain sampled between 1967 and 2003 from the Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments were analyzed using ICP-MS. The long-term effect of inorganic and organic fertilization on trace metal concentrations was investigated including the impact of atmospheric deposition and myccorhiza, whereas other factors such as soil conditions, crop cultivar, etc. are not discussed in this paper. Mean values derived from 10 experimental sites were reported. Significantly declining Pb and Cd concentrations in wheat grain could be explained by lower atmospheric deposition. Mean Se contents in all samples were 0.031 mg kg-1 grain dry weight. No samples had sufficiently high Se concentrations for human (0.05 mg Se kg-1) or animal demand (0.1 mg Se kg-1). Concentrations of Co in wheat grain were extremely low, 0.002-0.005 mg Co kg-1 grain dry weight, and far below the minimum levels required by animals, which applied to all fertilizer treatments. A doubling of Mo concentrations in grain since 1975 resulted in Cu/Mo ratios often below one, which may cause molybdenosis in ruminants. The increase in Mo concentrations in crops correlated with the decline in sulfur deposition. Concentrations of Cu and Fe declined in NPK-fertilized wheat as compared to unfertilized or manure-treated wheat. Very low concentrations of Se and Co and low concentrations of Fe and Cu require attention to counteract risks for deficiencies. The main characteristic of the study is that there are few significant changes over time between different fertilizer treatments, but throughout there are low concentrations of most trace elements in all treatments. In general, good agreement between concentrations in wheat from the long-term fertility experiments and the national monitoring program indicate that values are representative.

VL  - 547
SN  - NA
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the performance of community land surface model (CLM4.5) to simulate the hydrologic fluxes, such as, soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff with (without) remote sensing data assimilation. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR\_E) daily SM (both ascending and descending) are incorporated into the CLM4.5 model using data assimilation (DA) technique. The GLDAS data is used to validate the AMSR\_E SM data and evaluate the performance of CLM4.5 simulations. The AMSR\_E SM data are rescaled to meet the resolution of CLM4.5 model. By assimilating the AMSR\_E SM data into the CLM4.5 model can improve the SM simulations, especially over the climate transition zones in Africa, East Australia, South South America, Southeast Asia, and East North America in summer season. The Local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) technique improves the performance of CLM4.5 model compared to the directly substituted method. The improvement in ET and surface runoff simulations from CLM4.5 model assimilated with AMSR\_E SM data shares similar spatial patterns with SM. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 61
SN  - 0030-8870
AB  - The leeward Kohala Field System on the island of Hawai'i was one of the most intensive pre-European contact dryland agricultural systems. Archaeological and soil analysis has documented changes in soil nutrients over time. Soils were collected under agricultural field walls of different relative ages within the Kohala Field System. These field walls preserved soil from the time of their construction (between ca. A.D. 1400 and 1800), so soil samples from underneath older field walls have been exposed to a shorter period of cultivation than the soils under more recent field walls. Total P and P:Nb ratios of these buried soils were greater under walls than in once-cultivated surface soils, and greater under older walls than under younger walls. These results suggest that precontact cultivation decreased soil P reserves in this intensive agricultural landscape.

TI  - Flat thin mm-sized soil moisture sensor ({MSMS}) fabricated by gold compact discs etching for real-time in situ profiling
VL  - 255
SN  - NA
AB  - In situ direct soil moisture monitoring suffers from crucial problems including bulky sensor size, disturbance of soil texture, low accuracy and costly sensors. This study aimed at tackling this challenge by developing a novel flat thin mm-sized soil moisture sensor (MSMS) using gold compact discs etching. MSMSs were examined in six soil samples (sand/silt/clay mixtures), with soil moisture in each varying from zero to saturated. The capacitance and resistance readings of MSMSs were real-time recorded, and compared with soil moisture derived from conventional measurement. Both capacitance and resistance were found to correlate linearly with soil moisture, and the regression slopes were linearly correlated with soil porosity. This unique relationship facilitates accurate calculation of soil moisture based on MSMS readings for any given soil texture, which eliminates the need for tedious calibration of MSMSs in field applications. Four-week stability tests of MSMS showed the resistance readings did not drift throughout the test period, and the sensor surface observation indicated anti-scratching capability, demonstrating high stability for long-term continuous in situ monitoring of soil moisture.

VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - In regions affected by seasonal and permanently frozen conditions soil moisture influences the thermal regime of the ground as well as its ice content, which is one of the main factors controlling the sensitivity of mountain permafrost to climate changes. In this study, several well established soil moisture monitoring techniques were combined with data from geophysical measurements to assess the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of soil moisture at three high elevation sites with different ground properties and thermal regimes. The observed temporal evolution of measured soil moisture is characteristic for sites with seasonal freeze/thaw cycles and consistent with the respective site-specific properties, demonstrating the general applicability of continuous monitoring of soil moisture at high elevation areas. The obtained soil moisture data were then used for the calibration and validation of two different model approaches used in permafrost research in order to characterize the lateral and vertical distribution of ice content in the ground. Calibration of the geophysically based four-phase model (4PM) with spatially distributed soil moisture data yielded satisfactory two dimensional distributions of water-, ice-, and air content. Similarly, soil moisture time series significantly improved the calibration of the one-dimensional heat and mass transfer model COUP, yielding physically consistent soil moisture and temperature data matching observations at different depths.

TI  - A fiber bragg-grating-based miniature sensor for the fast detection of soil moisture profiles in highway slopes and subgrades
VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - A fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based aluminum oxide tube packed sensor (ATPS) was developed for the fast detection of the soil moisture profile in highway slopes and subgrades. The novel ATPS consists of an aluminum oxide tube with a diameter of 5 mm, an optical fiber containing a quasi-distributed FBG sensors, a â€œUâ€-shaped resistance wire, and a flange. There are four 0.9-mm diameter holes in the ATPS. Laboratory experiments were carried out to calibrate the relationship between the thermal response of ATPS and the soil moisture content. Two laboratory rainfall validation model tests were performed to validate the ATPS for capturing the soil moisture profile in highway slopes and subgrades. During the validations, the accuracy of the ATPS was quantified, and water infiltration through grassy and grassless ground surfaces were investigated. The calibrations indicate that the ATPS can detect and record real-time changes in the highway slope and subgrade moisture after rainfall, and reveal the most dangerous zones that occur at the connection between different construction materials. The average measurement accuracy of soil moisture monitoring was 0.015 m3/m3. Please note that the connection is where cracks form easily and the soil hydraulic conductivity increases significantly. The test results also indicate that grassy cover (lawn) significantly prevents water infiltration during the first few minutes of rainfall (twelve minutes in this study), after which, however, the infiltration rate drops sharply. The influence of lawn on water infiltration depends on the soil structure, hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall time. In summary, due to its small size and fast detection, the ATPS is a portable probe that can be used for moisture monitoring in highway slopes and subgrades. Â© 2018 by the authors.

VL  - 198
SN  - NA
AB  - The â€œtrapezoidâ€ or â€œtriangleâ€ model constitutes the most popular approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on coupled thermal (i.e., land surface temperature) and optical RS observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-Optical TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (STR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution within the STR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain. The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were below 0.04 cm3 cmâˆ’ 3 with local calibration and about 0.04â€“0.05 cm3 cmâˆ’ 3 without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing of soil moisture.

TI  - A combination of temperature, vegetation indexes and albedo, as obtained by airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, for the evaluation of soil moisture
VL  - 8
SN  - 1768-6733
AB  - Temperature as obtained by infrared remote sensing of bare soil or vegetation covered soil during day depends on soil water content ranging from the surface down to the root-zone. The main reason is that evaporation and plant transpiration cools down the soil surface and the leaves. However surface temperature does not only depend on soil moisture. It has to be combined with other measured variables. In this work we start with the classical combination between temperature and a vegetation index and we explore the benefit of adding the albedo or the cellulose absorption index to retrieve the surface soil moisture. The correlation between the inferred Soil Vegetation Wetness Index and the true moisture content is analyzed based on the thermal infrared and visible-NIR hyperspectral images recorded during Hymap 2007 campaign over Camargue (France).

TI  - Combining remote sensing and in situ soil moisture data for the application and validation of a distributed water balance model ({HIDROMORE
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - An application of the FAO56 approach to calculate actual evapotranspiration (AET) and soil moisture is reported, implemented by means of the HIDROMORE computerized tool, which performs spatially distributed calculations of hydrological parameters at watershed scale. The paper describes the application and validation of the model over 1 year in an area located in the central sector of the Duero Basin (Spain), where there is a network of 23 stations for continuous measurement of soil moisture (REMEDHUS; Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) distributed over an area of around 1300km2. The application integrated a series of Landsat 7 ETM+ images of 2002, from which the NDVI series (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and the map of land covers/uses were derived. Validation consisted of the use of the REMEDHUS soil moisture series and their comparison with the series resulting from the application. Two simulations were performed, with soil parameters values at the surface (0-5cm depth) and at the mean of the profile scale (0-100cm depth). The behaviour of the simulated soil moisture was described by means of its correlation with the measured soil moisture (determination coefficient, R2=0.67 for the surface values and 0.81 for the mean profile values), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), resulting in a range of it for the 23 stations between 0.010 and 0.061cm3cm-3. The application afforded an underestimation of the soil moisture content, which suggests the need for a redefinition of the limits of the plant available water used in the calculation. The results showed that HIDROMORE is an efficient tool for the characterization of hydrological parameters at global scale in the study zone. The combination of the FAO56 methodology and remote sensing techniques was efficient in the spatially distributed simulation of soil moisture. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect of vegetation index choice on soil moisture retrievals via the synergistic use of synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing
VL  - 80
SN  - NA
AB  - The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6Ëœ12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas. However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI) produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally, meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VI-derived roughness parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about 0.6âˆ¼0.8 [-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4âˆ¼0.6 [-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Microwave remote sensing of soil moisture: {Evaluation} of the {TRMM} microwave imager ({TMI}) satellite for the {Little} {River} {Watershed} {Tifton}, {Georgia
VL  - 307
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a critical role in many hydrological processes including infiltration, evaporation, and runoff. Satellite-based passive microwave sensors offer an effective way to observe soil moisture conditions over vast areas. There are currently several satellite systems that can detect soil moisture. Calibration, validation, and characterization of data received from these satellite systems are an ongoing process. One approach to these requirements is to collect and compare long-term in situ (field) measurements of soil moisture with remotely sensed data. The in situ measurements for this paper were collected at the Little River Watershed (LRW) Tifton, Georgia and compared to the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) 10.65 GHz vertical and horizontial (V and H) sensors and vegetation density Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period from 1999 through 2002. The in situ soil moisture probes exist in conjunction with rain gauge stations throughout the sampling region. It was found that the TMI was able to observe soil moisture conditions when vegetation levels were low. However, during several months each year high vegetation levels mask the soil moisture signal from the TMI. When the monthly averaged observation from the TMI, MODIS, and in situ probes were subjected to a multivariable comparison the correlation value increased slightly, improving the accuracy of the TMI - soil moisture correlation. Our results show that the TMI estimate would not result in an adequate monitoring of large land areas but when used in conjunction with other satellite sensors and in situ networks and model output can constitute an effective means of monitoring soil moisture of the land surface.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Sustainable nutrient cycling in agroecosystems combining grazing and crops has global ramifications for protecting these ecosystems and for the livelihoods they support. We sought to understand environmental, management, and social drivers of nutrient management and sustainability in Andean grazing/crop systems. We assessed the impact of farmer wealth, fields' proximity to villages, topography, and rangeland net primary productivity (NPP) on mass balances for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) of 43 fields. Wealthier farmers applied greater total amounts (kg) of manure nutrients. However, higher manure application rates (kg ha-1) were associated with field proximity and NPP rather than wealth. Manure P inputs in far fields ({\textgreater} 500-m distant) were half those in near fields. Harvest exports increased with manure inputs (P {\textless} 0.001) so that balances varied less than either of these flows. Erosion nutrient losses in steeper far fields matched crop exports, and yields declined with increasing field slope (P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting that erosion reduces productivity. Balances for P were slightly positive in near and far fields (+2.2 kg P ha-1y-1, combined mean) when calculated without erosion, but zero in near fields and negative in far fields with erosion included (-6.1 kg P ha-1y-1 in far fields). Near/far differences in both inputs and erosion thus drove P limitation. Crop K exports dominated K balances, which were negative even without accounting for erosion. Modeled intensification scenarios showed that remediating far field deficits would require P addition and erosion reduction. Management nested within environmental constraints (NPP, erosion) rather than socioeconomic status drives soil nutrient sustainability in these agroecosystems. Time-lags between management and long-term degradation are a principal sustainability challenge to farming in these montane grazing/crop agroecosystems.

VL  - 7
SN  - 1939-1404
AB  - In-depth study of the soil moisture mechanisms and understanding of the soil moisture transport law has an important practical significance for regional water resources management and the challenge of the water resources scarcity. Using traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring, deep soil layers can be monitored, but continuous monitoring of soil moisture at the regional level cannot be achieved. Although remote sensing simulation models can meet regional scale needs, these models are confined to the surface soil layer, and research on deep soil moisture inversion is still lacking. This paper focuses on these two issues, and investigates a remote sensing-driven soil moisture monitoring model for the Weihe River Basin. Considering water resource management needs in the Weihe River Basin, we improved the structure of the soil moisture balance model and optimized model parameters to build the remote sensing driven soil moisture balance model (RS-SWBM). Based on soil moisture modeling, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture in the Weihe River Basin was analyzed. The RS-SWBM developed for the Weihe River Basin was validated with observational data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data products. Based on the correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were all above 0.80, reflecting the effectiveness of the model. The effects of different vegetation types on soil moisture dynamics and consumption efficiency were analyzed. The results indicated that different vegetation types experienced different seasonal variations, vertical patterns, and consumption efficiencies, with strong correlations existing between these parameters and land use as well as precipitation.

TI  - Earth observation metadata ontology model for spatiotemporal-spectral semantic-enhanced satellite observation discovery: a case study of soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 53
SN  - 1548-1603
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture with satellite sensors is an effective approach for agricultural drought assessment. Currently, large quantities of sensor-derived observation data with different observation metadata models exist, and they require efficient and accurate methods of discovery. In this study, an earth observation (EO) metadata ontology with a spatiotemporal-spectral-enhanced structure is designed to solve this problem. The ontology is based on the proposed EO metadata model, which is composed of nonfunctional and functional sub-modules and supports the Open Geospatial Consortium EO profile of observations and measurements. Using EO metadata ontology, an application for soil moisture monitoring in Hubei Province in China is tested. The results indicate that metadata retrieval with a spatiotemporal-spectral-enhanced method can efficiently achieve fine-grained discovery of qualified EO metadata and obtain soil moisture monitoring information from sensor images. In summary, the spatiotemporal-spectral semantics in the proposed ontology demonstrate the use of EO metadata in the context of a soil moisture monitoring application, improving the efficiency and accuracy of EO metadata discovery.

TI  - Remote monitoring of soil moisture using passive microwave-based techniques - {Theoretical} basis and overview of selected algorithms for {AMSR}-{E
VL  - 144
SN  - NA
AB  - Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing has been shown to be a valuable tool in mapping and monitoring global soil moisture. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has made significant contributions to this application. As the result of agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented. Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing its operational soil moisture product. In order to achieve this goal, the theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences between the algorithms and how these differences affect their performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these algorithms.

VL  - 200
SN  - NA
AB  - Farmers in Central India practice a unique rain water management system ('Haveli') based on impounding rain water in the fields during three months monsoon season (June-September) and draining out in October. Winter crops, mainly grain legumes are then grown that utilize the soil moisture conserved in the soil profile. We monitored the soil physico-chemical and fertility properties, C and N mineralization, microbial populations and biomass and soil enzymes in the 0-30cm soil layer at ten sites over three years at four stages viz., prior to submergence in summer (PS), during water-logging (WL), after drainage (AD) and after legume cropping (AC). Anaerobic conditions during water-logging (for 11 weeks) led to extensive losses of soil carbon amounting to 1900mgCkg-1 soil but no significant change in soil N. Post-drainage and decomposition of weeds (for 6 weeks), there was an increase in soil C of 3700mgCkg-1 and soil N of 74.1mgNkg-1 soil. Overall in 17 weeks, there was a net increase of 1800mgCkg-1 (+30.5\%) and 87.5mgNkg-1 (+20.1\%) amounting to soil C and N accretion rate of 15.1mgCkg-1 soilday-1 and 0.74mgNkg-1 soilday-1. Microbial biomass decreased by 19.7\% during 11 weeks of water logging and improved by 54\% in the 6 weeks aerobic phase; an overall increment of 23.5\% (31mg microbial Ckg-1) in 17 weeks. Prolonged water-logging induced severe stress on microbial processes. However, post-drainage, there was significant improvement in microbial populations, nitrogen mineralization, soil enzymes and soil fertility. There were strong relationships between soil enzymes and microbial carbon; and, nitrogen mineralization and soil carbon. Results unequivocally demonstrated the benefits of rain-water conservation in Vertisols for carbon sequestration and nitrogen accretion and improvement of soil biological quality. Â© 2014.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - In situ soil moisture monitoring networks are critical to the development of soil moisture remote sensing missions as well as agricultural and environmental management, weather forecasting, and many other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0.04 m3 m-3. For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m3 m-3.

TI  - Estimation of volumetric soil water content over the {Liudaogou} river basin of the {Loess} {Plateau} using the {SWEST} method with spatial and temporal variability
VL  - 118
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture with spatial and temporal distribution is in big demand in arid and semi-arid regions. In Loess Plateau in China, where soil erosion is a major issue, information about soil water content helps in the planning of regional water resources and vegetation restoration for the prevention of erosion. In this study, we have developed the SWEST (soil water estimation from surface temperature) method by integrating well-known relationships among surface temperature, evapotranspiration and soil water content. An advantage of the proposed SWEST method is that it can estimate soil water content for the location of a water source of evapotranspiration, where there would be a near-surface for bare soil and the root zone for well vegetated surfaces. A verification study conducted at Liudaogou River Basin of the Loess Plateau, China, indicated the method could estimate soil water content accurately, with an estimation error of about 2.6\% of the total volume of soil. Application of the method to satellite thermal imaging successfully presented the applicability of the SWEST method to estimate soil water content with spatial and temporal variability.

TI  - Effects of 29-year long-term fertilizer management on soil phosphorus in double-crop rice system
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - Rational soil phosphorus (P) management is significant to crop production and environment protection. Little information is available on soil Olsen-P balance and critical values in double-crop rice in China. The main aim of the study was to relate soil Olsen-P to apparent P balance and to determine Olsen-P critical value for early and late rice using data from a 29-year study (1984 2012) at the Jiangxi province. The results showed that Olsen-P decreased by 0.12 0.26 mg/kg/year without P addition and increased by 0.56 2.52 mg/kg/year with P fertilization. Olsen-P decreased by 0.30 mg/kg for CK and NK under an average deficit of 100 kg P/ha, and increased by an average of 9.10 mg/kg in treatments with organic manures and were 4.55 times higher than chemical fertilizers with 100 kg/ha of P surplus. The critical values for early and late rice were 22.70 and 22.67 mg/kg, respectively. The average Olsen-P content is 90.89 mg/kg after 29-year application of chemical fertilizer and manures. Therefore, decreasing the amount of total P input and increasing the compost portion should be recommended to improve food production and protect environment in red paddy soils in south China.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55-km2 Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9-ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy. Â©2018. American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Reducing soil fertility to enable ecological restoration: {A} new method to test the efficacy of {Full}-{Inversion} {Tillage
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - Ecological restoration of high-quality, semi-natural communities of conservation value on ex-arable soils with raised fertility has been a major problem in northern Europe. One suggested way of tackling this problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile top-soil is moved below infertile sub-surface layers. This should provide infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique, usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment. In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to perturbation through time.

TI  - Calibration of a combined dielectric probe for soil moisture and porewater salinity measurement in organic and mineral coastal wetland soils
VL  - 161
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate measurement of soil moisture (Î˜), bulk electrical conductivity (Ïƒb), and porewater electrical conductivity (Ïƒw) in the vadose zone is critical for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. The use of combined dielectric probes allows for the automated collection of high-resolution, long-term data, however variation in probe response to different soil types can lead to unacceptably large measurement errors, especially in soils with high organic content such as those found in wetlands. The objectives of this study were to calibrate and field-test a combined, capacitance-based dielectric probe for three soil series encountered in the floodplain of a southeastern (USA) coastal river where watershed modifications have led to reduced freshwater flow and saltwater intrusion. To calibrate the probe, floodplain soils were categorized into three groups: a low organic content fine sand; a moderately organic, depositional fluvent soil; and a highly organic muck. PVC soil cores were packed at field bulk density, and Î¸ and Ïƒb were measured in the lab over a range of soil moistures (pressure potentials of 0-333cm H2O) and Ïƒw values (0.01-1.0S/m). Soil dielectric properties measured with the probe were used to test several potential models relating real and imaginary dielectric constants to Î¸, Ïƒb, and Ïƒw. Soil-specific calibrations improved Î¸ estimation over standard manufacturer calibrations, particularly for the more organic soils. Of all Î¸-Î¸b-Î¸w models tested, the empirical relationship proposed by Vogeler et al. (1996) performed the best (overall R2=0.97 for the three soils), though all models performed well in all soils (0.94â‰¤R2â‰¤0.98) and each can be selected for the specific range of Ïƒb expected in the field. Calibrations were successfully tested in the field by comparing in-ground probe estimates of Ïƒw with collocated soil water samples. These calibrations add to the limited published data available for soils of high organic content and support accurate monitoring of the vadose zone in coastal wetlands to inform restoration and management of these valued ecosystems.

TI  - The impact of soil erosion on soil fertility and vine vigor. {A} multidisciplinary approach based on field, laboratory and remote sensing approaches
VL  - 622-623
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape can determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of this research was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor, sediment delivery and SOC in a sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six pedons were studied along the slope by digging 6 pits up to 60 cm depth. Soil was sampled every 10 cm and SOC, water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were analyzed. Erosion rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the pole height method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared with measured pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion, sediment redistribution and SOC across the slope was strongly affected by topographic features, slope and curvature. The erosion rate was 16 Mg haâˆ’ 1 yâˆ’ 1 since the time of planting (6 years). SOC redistribution was strongly correlated with the detachment or deposition areas as highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC loss over six years amounted to 1.2 Mg C haâˆ’ 1. SUVA254 values, which indicate hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment site is more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor was strongly correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated that high resolution passive remote sensing data combined with soil and plant analyses can survey areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility, soil erosion and plant vigor. This will allow monitoring of soil erosion and degradation risk areas and support decision-makers in developing measures for friendly environmental management. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Extending the {SCOPE} model to combine optical reflectance and soil moisture observations for remote sensing of ecosystem functioning under water stress conditions
VL  - 221
SN  - NA
AB  - A radiative transfer and process-based model, called Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE), relates remote sensing signals with plant functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and evapotranspiration). Relying on optical remote sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state variables: (i) vapor pressure (ei), both in the soil pore space and leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the maximum carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) by a soil moisture dependent stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (rss) through approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3 grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004. By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled ei; (ii) with modeled ei and Vcmax; and (iii) with modeled ei, Vcmax, and rss. The outputs of all four simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements. The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in thermal observations.

TI  - The influence of water, land, energy and soil-nutrient resource interactions on the food system in {Uganda
VL  - 51
SN  - NA
AB  - Food Security continues to be elusive in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), several decades after the first World Food Summit in 1974. The causes of food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa include among others; poverty, economic constraints, agricultural and agronomical challenges, rapid population growth, and the effects of adverse climate change. These causes however, are linked to complex interactions, constraints and dependencies amongst the key physical resources in food systems, namely - Water, Land, Energy and Soil Nutrients (WLEN). There is limited insight on the combined impacts of the resource nexus, and how this may constrain the performance of food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This understanding is essential if the food challenges in the region are to be tackled sustainably. This study provides a detailed analysis of the Uganda's 2012 WLEN nexus resources vis-Ã -vis the country's current and potential food demand using calorific-demand analysis and source-to-service resource transformation modelling. The analysis determines estimates of the current resource stresses within Uganda's insufficient food system and the interconnected resource implications for the achievement of food security by 2050. The results are visualised using Sankey diagrams. The inferences highlight evident limits across all four resources. Overall, the analysis helps to inform food security policy and the resource context for the present and future management of Uganda's food system. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluation of near-surface soil moisture data from an {AAFC} monitoring network in {Manitoba}, {Canada}: {Implications} for {L}-band satellite validation
VL  - 521
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper examines near-surface soil moisture data (top 6cm) from an Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) monitoring network in southern Manitoba, Canada, over the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. This network is intended for use (in part) as a core validation site for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The network currently consists of 9 stations sited within agricultural fields. Each station uses a triplicate configuration of horizontally installed Hydra Probe soil moisture sensors at near-surface ( 5cm) to root-zone soil depths, in addition to permanently installed vertical surface sensors (0-5.7cm). This domain was studied intensively over the 6.5week SMAPVEX12 ground campaign in June/July 2012, providing coincident soil moisture datasets to assess network up-scaling over the domain. Results demonstrate that statistical differences exist between the network-level data from the horizontal (Î¸3.5-6.5cm) and vertical (Î¸0-5.7cm) surface Hydra Probes over 2012-13. Bootstrap resampling shows that a mean difference of 0.018m3m-3 (at 99\% confidence) is observed between Î¸3.5-6.5cm and Î¸0-5.7cm measurement depths (Î¸0-5.7cm sensors exhibit dry bias). Individual station analysis shows that the largest differences between Î¸3.5-6.5cm and Î¸0-5.7cm measurement depth occur at sites with higher clay content, whereas sensors located in sandy soils exhibit negligible differences. Up-scaling comparisons of the AAFC network to field-sampled data and a dense temporary network over SMAPVEX12 demonstrate that it is representative of the domain within 0.04m3m-3 RMSE. This suggests that the AAFC network is suitable for coarse resolution L-band microwave soil moisture validation. Comparison of Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture product data to the up-scaled AAFC network data over 2012-13 shows that superior temporal correlation is found with the Î¸0-5.7cm dataset. The difference in RMSEs between the SMOS comparisons to Î¸3.5-6.5cm and Î¸0-5.7cm network datasets is approximately 0.018m3m-3. These results suggest that differences of near-surface measurement depth and sensor configuration should be considered when conducting L-band satellite validation. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Photoassimilated carbon allocation in a wheat plant-soil system as affected by soil fertility and land-use history
VL  - 383
SN  - NA
AB  - Background and aims: Carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is influenced by the distribution of photo-assimilated C in the plant-soil system. Photo-assimilated C allocation in a wheat cropping system was examined to identify the links between soil fertility, C partitioning and soil C sequestration.; Methods: A pulse labelling experiment was conducted where14CO2 was introduced to wheat plants grown in two groups of soils of varying fertility: arable soils spiked with nutrients, and soils with differing land-use histories. Wheat shoot, root and soil samples were taken 1, 14 and 28 days after pulse labelling to examine the fluxes of14C in the plant-root-soil system.; Results: The partitioning of14C in wheat plant-root-soil system was found to vary with time, nutrient spiked soil fertility and land-use history. At the end of the experiment using spiked soils, a positive correlation was observed between the allocation of14C in the shoots and soil fertility, whereas in the roots, this relationship was negative. The overall allocation of14C in the plant-root system differed significantly between the land-use histories; while in the spiked arable soils14C allocation in the shoots and roots systematically followed their fertility status.; Conclusions: There was a weak relationship between C allocation and soil fertility in the soils of different land-use history compared to the strong relationship in the spiked arable soils. This suggests that other factors in the soils under different land uses were more important than nutrient status alone in driving photo-assimilated C allocation. This study demonstrated that soil fertility and land-use history have a crucial role in the allocation of photo-assimilated C in the plant-soil system and are important factors by which C sequestration in soil may be impacted.

TI  - Establishing the relationship of soil nitrogen immobilization to cereal rye residues in a mulched system
VL  - 426
SN  - NA
AB  - Background and aims: Soil nitrogen (N) immobilization from cover crop residues may help suppress weeds. We established a gradient of cereal rye shoot biomass to determine the extent that soil N can be immobilized and its effect on redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.). Methods: A microplot study was conducted in no-till cereal rye (Secale cereale L.)â€”soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr.)) systems at two sites in eastern USA. Microplots received 0, 2000, 5000, 8000, 12,000 or 15,000 kg haâˆ’1 of cereal rye shoot biomass, and were injected with two mg 15N kgâˆ’1 soil 5 cm below the soil surface. Pigweeds were sown and allowed to germinate. Results: Maximum rates of cereal rye shoot decomposition were observed at â‰¥5000 kg haâˆ’1. Although cereal rye shoot N declined, shoots became enriched with 15N, indicating fungal transfer of soil N to shoots. Soil inorganic N declined by an average of 5 kg N haâˆ’1. Pigweed tissue N and biomass were reduced in the presence of cereal rye. The magnitude of pigweed N reduction was similar across all shoot application rates. Conclusions: We found weak evidence for a cereal rye shoot-based N immobilization mechanism of weed suppression. Our results indicate N immobilization may be primarily due to root residues.

AB  - This study applied a dynamic nutrient balance method to estimate a stock of soil phosphorus and its usage pattern. We used panel data of published agricultural production, fertilizers supply, and livestock population to assess the net inflows, outflows, and stock of phosphorus in 19 regions of Tamil Nadu in the years 1990â€“2012. The dynamic model supported us to find pattern of phosphorus stocks and flow over the period, and more importantly, the total phosphorus outflow breakdown into removal by crop, soil, air, and water. This model simultaneously assesses the phosphorus stock, flows, and outflows inclusion of time factor, and thus it is one of robust agricultural environmental indicators. This paper will support the farmers and stakeholders to take an appropriate policy according to status of nutrient in the estimated agricultural regions. Â© 2017 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation with a remotely sensed dry edge determination based on the land surface temperature-vegetation index method
VL  - 13
SN  - 1931-3195
AB  - As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches, which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources, and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale. However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots, which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques.

TI  - A method for estimating the spatial distribution of soil moisture of arid microenvironments by close range thermal infrared imaging
VL  - 27
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - The topsoil moisture content, its spatial distribution and dynamics, are important variables in understanding the response of arid eco-geomorphic hill slope systems to rainfall. This study presents a method of measuring the soil moisture within a shrub's microenvironment by employing thermal infrared (TIR) imaging. A model for converting soil moisture (SMCM) is based on multi-temporal TIR images. The method incorporates data from in situ measurements of soil temperature, moisture content and local meteorological variables collected simultaneously with TIR imaging. The results obtained, together with the high spatial resolution of the TIR images, demonstrated the efficacy of this method for mapping soil moisture on micro-scale and also the potential for spatial analysis and change detection over time.

TI  - Simultaneous estimation of both soil moisture and model parameters using particle filtering method through the assimilation of microwave signal
VL  - 114
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a very important variable in land surface processes. Both field moisture measurements and estimates from modeling have their limitations when being used to estimate soil moisture on a large spatial scale. Remote sensing is becoming a practical method to estimate soil moisture globally; however, the quality of current soil surface moisture products needs to be improved in order to meet practical requirements. Data assimilation (DA) is a promising approach to merge model dynamics and remote sensing observations, thus having the potential to estimate soil moisture more accurately. In this study, a data assimilation algorithm, which couples the particle filter and the kernel smoothing technique, is presented to estimate soil moisture and soil parameters from microwave signals. A simple hydrological model with a daily time step is utilized to reduce the computational burden in the process of data assimilation. An observation operator based on the ratio of two microwave brightness temperatures at different,' frequencies is designed to link surface soil moisture with remote sensing measurements, and a sensitivity analysis of this operator is also cond ucted. Additionally, a variant of particle filtering method is developed for the joint estimation of soil moisture and soil parameters such as texture and porosity. This assimilation scheme is validated against field moisture measurements at the CEOP/Mongolia experiment site and is found to estimate near-surface soil moisture very well. The retrieved soil texture still contains large uncertainties as the retrieved values cannot converge to fixed points or narrow ranges when using different initial soil texture values, but the retrieved soil porosity has relatively small uncertainties.

TI  - Soil compaction, corn yield response, and soil nutrient pool dynamics within an integrated crop-livestock system in {Illinois
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems directly link crop and livestock production together to generate positive economic and environmental outcomes. Some methods used in integrated systems, like winter grazing on cropland, could negatively affect soil properties and crop productivity. We compared soil compaction, corn (Zea mays L.) yield, and soil nutrient pools between an integrated crop-livestock system and continuous com system to address this issue. The study was conducted near Pana, IL, between 2002 and 2006. Soil compaction was evaluated indirectly by measuring soil penetration resistance (PR) and surface CO2 effluxes. Total soil C, N, and microbial biomass C, were measured from 2002 to 2005. Soil PR and CO2 effluxes showed inconsistent trends related to soil compaction and cattle presence. Corn yield from 2004 to 2006 was higher (P = 0.01) in the integrated system (11.6 Mg ha-1) compared with continuous corn (10.6 Mg ha-1). Total soil C concentration increased significantly from 2002 to 2005 within components of the integrated system but remained unchanged in continuous corn. Microbial biomass C was also higher in the integrated system but only in 2005. The study determined that integration of crops with livestock had generally positive effects on crop yield and soil organic matter despite the potential for livestock to compact soil during winter grazing.

TI  - Soil phosphorus bioavailability assessed by {XANES} and {Hedley} sequential fractionation technique in a glacier foreland chronosequence in {Gongga} {Mountain}, {Southwestern} {China
VL  - 57
SN  - 1674-7313
AB  - The primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems is influenced by soil phosphorus bioavailability, which depends largely on chemical fractions of phosphorus. The sequential fractionation technique developed by Hedley et al. or its subsequent modification is a well-known method to determine soil phosphorus forms. Hedley sequential fractionation technique separates the phosphorus into fractions based on their different chemical solubilities in extractants with certain chemical properties. Recently, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been employed to measure soil phosphorus species directly and non-invasively. The XANES method provides information concerning local structure and chemical information of target elements at a molecular level. Thus, it can distinguish phosphorus fractions bound by metal oxides or hydroxides (such as Fe, Al, and Ca). In this present work, the phosphorus speciation of topsoil along a glacial foreland chronosequence in Gongga Mountain is determined using these two methods. The changes in soil phosphorus bioavailability along the 120-year-old chronosequence are assessed based on comparisons of the results obtained by these two methods. The results indicate that Hedley sequential fractionation technique shows a greater ability to determine soil bioavailable phosphorus (Resin-P and NaCHO3-P), while XANES is effective in distinguishing phosphorus bound by metal compounds. In the chronosequence, Ca- and Al-bound phosphorus were derived mainly from primary minerals, whose phosphorus contents decreased within 120 years of moraine weathering and soil development. The content of soil bioavailable phosphorus increased rapidly after 30 years since deglaciation. The increasing phosphorus bioavailability promoted the colonizing and primary succession vegetation.

TI  - Direct and residual effect of sewage sludge on yield, heavy metals content and soil fertility under rice-wheat system
VL  - 69
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil application of sewage sludge in crop production offers an alternative technique for its disposal and management. The present study was taken up to evaluate the effect of sewage sludge on yield of rice, soil fertility and heavy metals accumulation in grain and straw in a glass house. The residual effect of sludge application was evaluated in subsequent wheat crop in the sequence. Five doses of sludge i.e., 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40tha-1 were applied to rice and their effects were compared with the recommended dose of fertilizers i.e., 120, 60 and 60kgN, P2O5 and K2Oha-1, respectively. There was significant increase in straw and grain yields of both the crops with application of sludge. The grain yield of rice increased 45\% at 40tha-1 sludge application over no sludge. The residual effect on wheat yield was more pronounced. Soil pH in post harvest rice soil increased with the application of sludge, however, it decreased in post harvest wheat soil at higher levels of sludge application. Increase in available nutrients content of soil was also recorded with increasing levels of sludge application after harvest of rice and wheat crops. Application of sludge also increased the heavy metals contents in soil and plant. The Cd content in rice grain was above the Indian safe limit at 20tha-1 or higher levels of sludge application. There was a significant build up of P, S, Zn, Fe, and Mn in post harvest wheat soil at 40tha-1 sludge application. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of native or exotic trees on soil fertility in decades of silvopastoral system at the {Brazilian} savannah biome
VL  - 92
SN  - NA
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPSs) are considered a conservationist system by combining forestry species cultivation with domesticated grazing animals, intercropping trees, and pasture in the same area. SPSs are noun for its contribution to improve soil chemical and physical properties, enhance grass nutritional status, provide healthier animal environment, and increase farmersâ€™ options to maximize the use of land. In soil degraded areas, such as those found in Brazilian savannah biome (BSB), the SPSs constitute an alternative to soil recuperation in these areas. Therefore, our aim was to assess soil fertility attributes at different depths on a BSB grown with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu grass, the influence of SPS with native tree zeyheria (Zeyheria tuberculosa) settled in 1984, or with the exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) settled in 1994. The soil water pH, P, Ca, Mg, and K contents, as well as soil base sum and saturation, were found superior mostly at the top layer (0â€“2 cm) of the eucalyptus site, than for the ipÃª-felpudo site. This response was correlated to greater soil organic matter and carbon at the eucalyptus site, which demonstrated to have high nutrient cycling rates. Around 50 \% of the CEC in both SPSs was occupied by bases, demonstrating that the areas have large potential to absorb applied nutrients. The SPSs have no significant impact on S-SO42âˆ’ or micronutrient availability. The litter composition in eucalyptus site was accountable for the superior results of this SPS, which has shown as a promising choice for land use and conservation in the BSB.

TI  - Phosphorous and mung bean residue incorporation improve soil fertility and crop productivity in sorghum and mungbean-lentil cropping system
VL  - 31
SN  - NA
AB  - In sorghum and mungbean - lentil cropping system, field experiments were conducted for three successive years to assess the effect of mung bean residue incorporation on sorghum and succeeding lentil productivity along with different doses of phosphorus (P; 0, 30, 60 kg ha- 1) applied to these crops. The level of soil fertility was also tested with or without incorporation of mung bean residue. The interaction of phosphorus to mungbean residue incorporation was thus studied in relation to improve crop productivity with balancing fertilizer requirements through an eco-friendly approach. Sorghum grain yield increased significantly when 60 kg P2O5 ha- 1 was applied and mungbean residue incorporated. The response was reduced to 30 kg P2O5 ha- 1 when mungbean residue was not incorporated. The succeeding lentil crop responded up to 60 kg P2O5 ha- 1 only when preceding sorghum crop received 0 or 30 kg P2O5 ha- 1. Response to applied P2O5 to lentil reduced to 30 kg ha- 1 when preceding sorghum crop received 60 kg P2O5 ha- 1 and mungbean residue incorporated. Available soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon content increased when mungbean residue was incorporated; however, available potassium (K) of the soil decreased from its initial value.

TI  - Evaluation of a surface energy balance method based on optical and thermal satellite imagery to estimate root-zone soil moisture
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a vital parameter in various land surface processes, and microwave remote sensing is widely used to estimate regional soil moisture. However, the application of the retrieved soil moisture data is restricted by its coarse spatial resolution. To overcome this weakness, many methods were proposed to downscale microwave soil moisture data. The traditional method is the microwave-optical/IR synergistic approach, in which land surface temperature (LST), vegetation index and surface albedo are key parameters. However, due to the uncertainty in absolute LST estimation, this approach is partly dependent on the accuracy of LST estimation. To eliminate the impacts of LST estimation, an improved downscaling method is proposed in this study to downscale Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture product with visible and thermal data of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Two temperature temporal variation parameters related to soil moisture, including mid-morning rising rate and daily maximum temperature time, are introduced in the proposed method to replace LST. The proposed method and the traditional method are both applied to the Iberian Peninsula area for July and August 2007. Comparison of the two results shows that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) has an average improvement of 0.08 and the root mean square error has a systematic decrease. The downscaled soil moisture by the proposed method was validated by REMEDHUS soil moisture network in the study area, and site specific validation gets poor correlation between the two datasets because of the low spatial representativeness of site measurement for one MSG-SEVIRI pixel. Although the comparisons at 15 km and network scale show an improvement over the site specific comparison, it is found that the downscaling method systematically degrades the accuracy in soil moisture data, with a R-squared of 0-0.4 and 0.218 for the downscaled data set against 0.7-0.8 and 0.571 for AMSR-E data at 15 km scale and the network scale respectively.

TI  - Impact of center pivot irrigation system uniformity on growth of potato crop and residual soil nitrogen
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Maintaining the homogeneity of soil nitrogen (N) and plant vigor across agricultural fields is a major concern for farmers and agricultural scheme planners, particularly fields that are irrigated through pressurized systems, such as center pivots. Therefore, this study was carried out on a 30 hm 2 potato field located 650 km south of Riyadh, the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to investigate the impact of the center pivot irrigation distribution uniformity on the crop development and the spatial distribution of residual soil N. Irrigation performance test was designed to investigate water application rate and distribution uniformities. The overall water application uniformity coefficients (Cu), determined through Christiansen (CuC) and Heerman (CuH) methods, were determined at 81.29\% and 80.64\%, respectively. However, the overall water distribution uniformity (Du) was determined at 70\%. A considerable variability in the distribution uniformity of irrigation water was observed across the experimental field (a Du value of 67\% over the medium spans compared to a Du value of 88\% over the inner spans). Results of this study showed a linear correlation between the irrigation water distribution uniformity and the soil N (R 2 =0.88). On the other hand, the vegetation cover distribution, indicated by the Cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (CNDVI), was not found to be much responsive to the irrigation distribution uniformity (R 2 =0.11). A time series of successive NDVI maps extracted throughout the potato crop growth stages showed a consistent trend in the distribution of NDVI across the field, with R 2 values that ranged between 0.25-0.73.

VL  - 117
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper the soil moisture is estimated at airborne level and at satellite level by combining remotely sensed images with in situ measurements. At airborne level we process high-resolution images acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) sensor, and at satellite level we compute images acquired with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The study has been accomplished in the framework of two field campaigns in the Barrax region (Spain): the SEN2FLEX (SENtinel-2 and FLuorescence EXperiment) campaign which was developed in July of 2005 and the SEN3EXP (Sentinel-3 Experiment) campaign which was carried out in June of 2009. The methodology proposed considers the correlation between the surface temperature, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the emissivity. With this methodology the soil moisture from AHS data can be obtained with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05m 3/m 3 compared with ground measurements and from ASTER images with a RMSE of 0.06m 3/m 3.

TI  - Improving productivity and increasing the efficiency of soil nutrient management on grassland farms in the {UK} and {Ireland} using precision agriculture technology
VL  - 106
SN  - NA
AB  - Grass growth and utilisation on grassland farms across the UK and Ireland are below their potential, and nutrient management is sub-optimal. Excessive soil phosphorus concentrations are an issue, contributing to eutrophication of waterways, while sub-optimal soil pH due to a reduction in lime use is seen in many areas. This paper discusses the potential for introducing technology onto grassland farms, and implementing sensible farm-specific management decisions as a means of enhancing productivity and minimising the environmental impact of livestock farming. The adoption rate of Precision Agriculture (PA) technology by grassland farmers in the UK and Ireland is still relatively low, and significantly lagging behind the advances that have taken place within the arable farming community. With rapidly advancing technology and investment in research, there are now a range of soil sensors available along with technology for grass growth monitoring, yield mapping, remote sensing, satellite imagery, and devices for tracking animal movement, behaviour and feed intake. In this review paper we examine the latest technology developments specific to grassland farming and we question their suitability and â€˜readinessâ€™ for adoption by farmers. The review identifies the challenges that are specific to grassland such as complex soil, vegetation and climatic variables along with economic barriers that may be preventing change within the farming community in these areas.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation for spring wheat in a semiarid area based on low-altitude remote-sensing data collected by small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles
VL  - 12
SN  - 1931-3195
AB  - As an important component of the Earth's ecosystem, soil moisture plays a vital role in the global water cycle and serves as an important parameter in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and agroecology. Based on the energy balance theory of underlying surface, the atmospheric temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station as well as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal infrared and multispectral remote-sensing data were used to establish inversion models of relative soil moisture at different depths based on remote-sensing UAV data and date from near-ground quadrats, respectively. Spatial differences and data accuracy verification were then performed using the 2017 spring wheat moisture data as a control. The results showed that: (1) the relative moisture of farmland soil can be effectively estimated using the proposed soil moisture inversion model. In terrestrial ecosystems, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, which is often used to characterize potential drought levels, is linearly correlated to soil moisture at different depths; (2) during the inversion of farmland soil moisture, the UAV-based observation method is superior to the near-ground quadrat observation method in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the relative soil moisture estimation model based on UAV data has a high accuracy, with R-2 reaching 0.629, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of {\textless}0.100; and (3) the number and size of quadrats are important factors affecting the inversion accuracy. The data collected by the UAVs covered a wide range and had high spatial matching degree at the field scale. Especially, during estimation of the relative moisture of surface soil (0 to 10 and 0 to 20 cm), the linear fitting between the inversion model based on UAV data and the measured value was optimal. The error was minimal (RMSE {\textless}0.07) and R-2 was {\textgreater}0.714, so this method is more suitable for estimating and dynamically monitoring relative soil moisture of farmland at the field scale.

TI  - Elimination of the soil moisture effect on the spectra for reflectance prediction of soil salinity using external parameter orthogonalization method
VL  - 10
SN  - 1931-3195
AB  - Soil salinization is a common desertification process, especially in arid lands. Hyperspectral remote sensing of salinized soil is favored for its advantages of being efficient and inexpensive. However, soil moisture often jointly has a great influence on the soil reflectance spectra under field conditions. It is a challenge to establish a model to eliminate the effect of soil moisture and quantitatively estimate the salinity contents of slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted by way of continuously monitoring changes of soil moisture and salt content, which was mainly focused on the slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. We investigated the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) method to remove the effect of soil moisture (4 to 36\% in weight base) by preprocessing soil spectral reflectance and establishing the partial least squares regression after EPO preprocessing model (EPO-PLS) to predict soil salt content. Through comparing PLS with EPO-PLS model, R-2 and ratio of prediction to deviation rose from 0.604 and 1.063, respectively, to 0.874 and 2.865 for validation data. Root mean square error and bias were, respectively, reduced from 1.163 and 0.141 g/100 g to 0.718 and 0.044 g/100 g. The performance of the model after EPO algorithm preprocessing was improved significantly. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Monitoring soil moisture status in a {Black} {Vertosol} on the {Liverpool} {Plains}, {NSW}, using a combination of neutron scattering and electrical image methods
VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - Electrical image data were used to estimate soil moisture content beneath smectite-dominated black Vertosol in the Liverpool Plains catchment in northern New South Wales. Measurements carried out over a range of soil moisture conditions included: water use by lucerne sown into a full profile, recharge of profiles after lucerne and long fallow after a cereal crop. Measurements were repeated approximately every 2 months between September 2000 and August 2001. Estimates of bulk electrical conductivity (EC), determined from inversion of apparent conductivity electrical images, were compared to soil moisture measurements made using neutron access tubes. A correlation of 0.77 (n = 228, P {\textless} 0.0001) between the 2 datasets indicates that electrical imaging can be used to satisfactorily predict bulk moisture content in soils of this type. Interpretation of the bulk EC images indicates drying of the soil profile to 6m depth beneath lucerne. Â© CSIRO 2005.

TI  - Long-term effects of controlled release urea application on crop yields and soil fertility under rice-oilseed rape rotation system
VL  - 184
SN  - NA
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has played an important role in increasing rice and oilseed rape yields, but more than half of the N fertilizer applied into the field has been lost and results in not only an environmental hazard but also a substantial economic loss. Thus, the controlled release N fertilizer was expected to reduce the labor cost from fertilizer dressing, to the convenience of fertilizers application and to increase N use efficiency. A 7-year field fertilization experiment applied controlled-release urea (CRU) 100\% (180kgha-1), 70\% (126kgha-1) and 50\% (90kgha-1) of the recommended N fertilizer to explore its effects on crops yield and soil fertility under the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation system in Hubei province of China. Meanwhile the equivalent rates of N as common urea were supplied as split applications in different growth stages as the control. The N release characteristic of CRU in field condition was closely matched to the demand for N during the whole growth periods of crops. Consequently, the CRU treatments achieved significantly higher rice and oilseed rape yield by 6.1-8.2\% and 6.3-15.5\%, the mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of CRU treatments was increased by 15.4-38.4\%, and the average annual net profit was also increased by 16.0-20.8\%, compared with urea treatment at the same N rate. For each type of N fertilizer, the yield increased as the input N rate increased. However, reducing CRU rate by 30\% produced the same yield of rice and oilseed rape as with the 100\% rate of urea. And, the rice yield of CRU50\% treatment was even showed no significant with Urea100\% treatment. The contents of nitrate N (NO3â€“N) and ammonium N (NH4+-N) were higher in 0-40cm soil of CRU treatments than urea treatments over 7-year fertilization in 2013, but the opposite trend was found in 60-100cm soil, which indicating that CRU decreased the NO3â€“N and NH4+-N leaching to deep in the soil. The contents of total N and organic matter were increased by applying CRU for 7 years compared with urea fertilizer. Although the contents of available P and K were increased over the 7 years of fertilization and cultivation, no prominent difference was observed between CRU70\% and Urea100\%. The results suggest that a 30\% decrease in the recommended application rate of N is possible with CRU while maintaining the same yield, preserving the soil fertility and also labor/time-saving.

TI  - Numerical assisted assessment of vadose-zone nitrogen transport under a soil moisture controlled wastewater {SDI} dispersal system in a {Vertisol
VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - A real-time soil moisture controlled wastewater SDI dispersal system was tested in a Vertisol for approximately one year to regulate soil nitrogen from an artificially prepared septic effluent. The control strategy was to allow wastewater hydraulic disposal only when the drain field moisture level was near field capacity. Due to limited field sampling and resulting uncertainty in rate of field nitrification/denitrification, numerical simulation (HYDRUS 2D) was utilized to assess system control over nitrogen concentrations in the drain field. Using nitrification/denitrification rates estimated from cumulative frequency distributions (CFD), simulated drain field moisture levels were found statistically lower than actual field observations over the entire year, suggesting persistent drain field soil swelling which is theoretically favorable to denitrification. Short- and long-term simulations suggest that denitrification level should be 50\% higher than 50\% CFD (first-order reaction, 0.042day-1). Although no conclusive results are presented, this study indicates a potential management approach that favors denitrification by regulating nitrogen application using soil moisture. Further study is required to optimize soil moisture to increase wastewater hydraulic disposal while restricting nitrogen concentrations within the managed soil horizon. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Intercomparison of microwave remote-sensing soil moisture data sets based on distributed eco-hydrological model simulation and \textit{in situ} measurements over the {North} {China} {Plain
VL  - 34
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Intercomparisons of microwave-based soil moisture products from active ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and passive AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System) is conductedbased onsurface soil moisture (SSM) simulations from the eco-hydrological model, Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP), after it is carefully validated with in situ measurements over the North China Plain. Correlations with VIP SSM simulation are generally satisfactory with average values of 0.71 for ASCAT and 0.47 for AMSR-E during 2007-2009. ASCAT and AMSR-E present unbiased errors of 0.044 and 0.053 m(3) m(-3) on average, with respect to model simulation. The empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis results illustrate that AMSR-E provides more consistent SSM spatial structure with VIP than ASCAT; while ASCAT is more capable of capturing SSM temporal dynamics. This is supported by the facts that ASCAT has more consistent expansion coefficients corresponding to primary EOF mode with VIP (R=0.825, p{\textless}0.1). However, comparison based on SSM anomaly demonstrates that AMSR-E and ASCAT have similar skill in capturing SSM short-term variability. Temporal analysis of SSM anomaly time series shows that AMSR-E provides best performance in autumn, while ASCAT provides lower anomaly bias during highly-vegetated summer with vegetation optical depth of 0.61. Moreover, ASCAT retrieval accuracy is less influenced by vegetation cover, as it is in relatively better agreement with VIP simulation in forest than in other land-use types and exhibits smaller interannual fluctuation than AMSR-E. Identification of the error characteristics of these two microwave soil moisture data sets will be helpful for correctly interpreting the data products and also facilitate optimal specification of the error matrix in data assimilation at a regional scale.

TI  - Use of a partial-width tillage system maintains benefits of no-tillage in increasing total soil nitrogen
VL  - 118
SN  - NA
AB  - Tillage treatments had impact on total soil nitrogen (N) storage and consequently on soil carbon (C) sequestration. The objective of this study was to assess effects of long-term (1992-2010) tillage practices, including a partial-width tillage system (paraplow) on N concentration and stratification. The tillage treatments were: no-tillage (NT), minimum tillage (18-22cm depth) with chisel plow (MT), conventional tillage (25-30cm depth) with mouldboard plow (CT) and zone-tillage subsoiling (25-30cm) with a paraplow (ZT) applied in alternate years in rotation with NT. The soil was a Calcic Haploxeralf from Central Spain. The crop rotation was chick pea (Cicer arietinun L.) cv. Inmaculada/barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Volley. The equivalent mass approach was used to compare N stocks in the various tillage methods. Tillage treatments had significant effects on soil bulk density and no-till increased soil bulk density of the top layer. At the end of 19 years, the stocks of N had increased under NT compared with MT and CT. Most changes occurred within the 0-5cm layer, where plots under NT had 0.48MgNha -1 and 0.53MgNha -1 greater than in MT and CT, respectively. Zone tillage maintained most of the long-term benefit of NT in increasing N stocks in the top layer (0-5cm). At the end of the experiment, total N concentration in the 0-5cm depth under ZT was 42\% and 53\% higher that under MT and CT, respectively. Stratification ratios of N from 1992 to 2000 showed no significant differences between NT, MT and CT. In contrast, from 2001 onwards, all stratification ratios were significantly higher in NT than in the other two tillage systems. In addition, in 2010 the stratification ratio of N in NT was {\textgreater}2 and more than 2-fold those obtained in MT and CT. Values of stratification ratios under ZT followed the same trend than under NT and were significantly greater than under MT or CT. These greater stratification ratios of N observed under NT and ZT confirm, in the soil studied, not only the benefits associated with the long-term application of no-till in increasing total N in the top layer, but also the positive impact of the use of a paraplow as a rotational tillage system.

VL  - 100
SN  - NA
AB  - An experiment with the free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) method was conducted in a paddy field at Wuxi (Jiangsu Province, China) to study effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] on availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown under ambient CO2 or FACE (ambient + 200 Î¼mol mol-1 CO2) conditions throughout the growth season. Low N (LN) and normal N (NN) were applied, LN being 150 kg ha-1 for rice and 125 kg ha-1 for wheat and NN being 250 kg ha-1 for both rice and wheat. Compared with the ambient [CO2] condition, elevated [CO2] significantly increased crop biomass and P uptake for both rice and wheat and N uptake only for wheat at several main growth stages. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on biomass, N and P uptake of wheat were greater than of rice. Soil available N was decreased by elevated [CO2] by 47\% in LN and 29\% in NN at the rice tillering stage at jointing stage and decreased by 25.4\% and 28.3\% in LN and by 33.3\% and 53.1\% in NN at the wheat seeding and heading stages, respectively. Soil available P was decreased by elevated [CO2] in rice by 32.0\% in LN and by 29.6\% in NN at the jointing stage, but increased by 22.4\% and 20.8\% at the heading stage and by 33.8\% and 30.7\% at the ripening stage in LN and NN, respectively. While in the wheat season, soil available P was not affected significantly by elevated [CO2] at each stage. These results suggest that under elevated [CO2] availability of soil N and P increased, particularly P and application of N and P should be adjusted to need for rice at tillering and jointing and for wheat at whole growth stages.

TI  - Evaluation of multiple surface soil moisture for {Korean} regional flux monitoring network sites: {Advanced} {Microwave} {Scanning} {Radiometer} {E}, land surface model, and ground measurements
VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - In the past few decades, there have been great developments in remotely sensed soil moisture, with validation efforts using land surface models (LSMs) and ground-based measurements, because soil moisture information is essential to understanding complex land surface-atmosphere interactions. However, the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture has been very limited because of the scarcity of the ground measurements in Korea. This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0Â·10-0Â·14 m 3 m -3 and wet BIAS = 0Â·09 - 0Â·04 m 3 m -3) with the CLM and ground-based measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized by complex geophysical conditions. Additional evaluations should be required to facilitate the use of recent and forthcoming remotely sensed soil moisture data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive missions at representative future validation sites.

TI  - Global warming potential and greenhouse gas emission under different soil nutrient management practices in soybeanâ€“wheat system of central {India
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient management is a key component contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) flux and mitigation potential of agricultural production systems. However, the effect of soil nutrient management practices on GHG flux and global warming potential (GWP) is less understood in agricultural soils of India. The present study was conducted to compare three nutrient management systems practiced for nine consecutive years in a soybeanâ€“wheat cropping system in the Vertisols of India, in terms of GHG flux and GWP. The treatments were composed of 100\% organic (ONM), 100\% inorganic (NPK), and integrated nutrient management (INM) with 50\% organic + 50\% inorganic inputs. The gas samples for GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) were collected by static chamber method at about 15-day interval during 2012â€“13 growing season. The change in soil organic carbon (SOC) content was estimated in terms of the changes in SOC stock in the 0â€“15 cm soil over the 9-year period covering 2004 to 2013. There was a net uptake of CH4 in all the treatments in both soybean and wheat crop seasons. The cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions were in the order of INM {\textgreater} ONM {\textgreater} NPK with significant difference between treatments (p {\textless} 0.05) in both the crop seasons. The annual GWP, expressed in terms of CH4 and N2O emission, also followed the same trend and was estimated to be 1126, 1002, and 896 kg CO2 eq haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 under INM, ONM, and NPK treatments, respectively. However, the change in SOC stock was significantly higher under ONM (1250 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1) followed by INM (417 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1) and least under NPK (198 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1) treatment. The wheat equivalent yield was similar under ONM and INM treatments and was significantly lower under NPK treatment. Thus, the GWP per unit grain yield was lower under ONM followed by NPK and INM treatments and varied from 250, 261, and 307 kg CO2 eq Mgâˆ’1 grain yield under ONM, NPK, and INM treatments, respectively.

TI  - In-{Situ} {Measurement} of {Soil} {Permittivity} at {Various} {Depths} for the {Calibration} and {Validation} of {Low}-{Frequency} {SAR} {Soil} {Moisture} {Models} by {Using} {GPR
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - At radar frequencies below 2 GHz, the mismatch between the 5 to 15 cm sensing depth of classical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe soil moisture measurements and the radar penetration depth can easily lead to unreliable in situ data. Accurate quantitative measurements of soil water contents at various depths by classical methods are cumbersome and usually highly invasive. We propose an improved method for the estimation of vertical soil moisture profiles from multi-offset ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. A semi-automated data acquisition technique allows for very fast and robust measurements in the field. Advanced common mid-point (CMP) processing is applied to obtain quantitative estimates of the permittivity and depth of the reflecting soil layers. The method is validated against TDR measurements using data acquired in different environments. Depth and soil moisture contents of the reflecting layers were estimated with root mean square errors (RMSE) on the order of 5 cm and 1.9 Vol.-\%, respectively. Application of the proposed technique for the validation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) soil moisture estimates is demonstrated based on a case study using airborne L-band data and ground-based P-band data. For the L-band case we found good agreement between the near-surface GPR estimates and extended integral equation model ((IEM)-E-2) based SAR retrievals, comparable to those obtained by TDR. At the P-band, the GPR based method significantly outperformed the TDR method when using soil moisture estimates at depths below 30 cm.

TI  - Triangle space-based surface soil moisture estimation by the synergistic use of insitu measurements and optical/thermal infrared remote sensing: {An} alternative to conventional validations
VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Together with the continuous development of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products from newly launched satellites, it is necessary to perform reliable validations to assess their accuracy. With this aim, a new 'bottom-up' validation approach is proposed based on the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18 cloud-free days from Landsat-8. An SSM estimation method using the boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional SSM mapping. The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance (mean R2 and root-mean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 m3/m3 , respectively). Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3 high-resolution (0.1Â° /10 km) soil moisture product to validate it both at network and grid-cell levels. At the network level, the derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ measurements over the network ( R = 0.731 ). However, at the grid-cell level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases (-0.044 to -0.090m3/m3) and positive correlations ( R {\textgreater} 0.25 ) for most cells. In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a slightly better performance than does the ascending one. The preliminary assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales between satellite observation and in situ measurements.

TI  - Chickpea water use efficiency in relation to cropping system, cultivar, soil nitrogen and {Rhizobial} inoculation in semiarid environments
VL  - 97
SN  - NA
AB  - Crops grown in semiarid rainfed conditions are prone to water stress which could be alleviated by improving cultural practices. This study determined the effect of cropping system, cultivar, soil nitrogen status and Rhizobium inoculation (Rz) on water use and water use efficiency (WUE) of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in semiarid environments. The cultivars Amit, CDC Anna, CDC Frontier, and CDC Xena were grown in no-till barley, no-till wheat, and tilled-fallow systems and under various rates of N fertilizer (0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 kg N ha-1) coupled with or without Rz. The study was conducted at Swift Current and Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, from 2004 to 2006. On average, chickpea used about 10 mm of water from the top 0-15 cm soil depth. In the tilled-fallow system, chickpea extracted 20\% more water in the 15-30 cm depth, 70\% more in the 30-60 cm depth, and 156\% more in the 60-120 cm depth than when it was grown in the no-till systems. CDC Xena had WUE of 5.3 kg ha-1 mm-1 or 20\% less than the average WUE (6.6 kg ha-1 mm-1) of the three other cultivars, even though these cultivars used the same amounts of water. Water use efficiency increased from 4.7 to 6.8 kg ha-1 mm-1 as N fertilizer rate was increased from 0 to 112 kg N ha-1 when chickpea was grown in the no-till barley or wheat systems, but chickpea grown in the tilled-fallow system did not respond to changes in the fertilizer N rates averaging WUE of 6.5 kg ha-1 mm-1. In the absence of N fertilizer, the application of Rz increased WUE by 33\% for chickpea grown in the no-till barley system, 30\% in the no-till wheat system, and 9\% in the tilled-fallow system. Chickpea inoculated with Rhizobium achieved a WUE value similar to the crop fertilized at 84 kg N ha-1. Without the use of Rz, chickpea increased WUE in a linear fashion with increasing fertilizer N rates from 0 to 84 kg N ha-1. Cropping system, cultivar, and inoculation all had greater impact on WUE than on the amount of water extracted by the crop from the soil. The improvement of cultural practices to promote general plant health along with the development of cultivars with improved crop yields will be keys for improving water use efficiency of chickpea in semiarid environments.

TI  - Organically fertilized onions ({Allium} cepa {L}.): {Effects} of the fertilizer placement method on quercetin content and soil nitrogen dynamics
VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Field-cured onions cv. Hyskin (Allium cepa L.) supplied with organic nitrogen fertilizer were studied. The fertilizer was applied by broadcasting and harrowing, broadcasting and rotary cultivation, or placement between rows. Nitrogen dynamics were monitored throughout the growing season by soil sampling. Variation in quercetin content in the onion scales was analyzed by HPLC. The organically fertilized onions were compared with inorganically fertilized onions grown in the same field. Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the row at sowing or during commercial transplant production was tested but did not significantly affect mycorrhizal root colonization levels in the field. Onions that received no fertilizer at all or that had fertilizer placed between rows had better establishment, probably due to more favorable soil nitrogen concentrations for seedling emergence. Broadcast application led to higher nitrogen concentration in the root zone, resulting in fewer but larger individual onions. Quercetin levels were not significantly altered as a result of nitrogen fertilizer source (inorganic or organic), application method, or mycorrhizal inoculation. However, variation between years was significant, with quercetin levels in 2004 almost twice as high as those in 2005. Â© 2008 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Estimation of root zone soil moisture using passive microwave remote sensing: {A} case study for rice and wheat crops for three states in the {Indo}-{Gangetic} basin
VL  - 234
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper investigates estimation of root zone soil moisture using two passive microwave remote sensing datasets, Advanced Microwave Scattering Radiometer â€“ 2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites sensors. The study is focused on two crops, namely rice and wheat for the Indo-Gangetic basin, India, having a dynamic crop and soil type and land use land cover. A total of 21 rice crop and 23 wheat crop locations are chosen from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar falling in the basin. The root zone soil moisture information is derived by estimating soil wetness index from surface soil moisture at 10 and 40 cm depths using a recursive exponential filter. The soil wetness index based algorithm is implementable even in the absence of ground information for a basin level study. The reference soil moisture dataset is obtained from the Global Land Database Assimilation System â€“ NOAH at 10 and 40 cm depth. The research has also demonstrated significant potential of GLDAS-NOAH soil moisture data in the absence of ground (in-situ) soil moisture data. Of the various factors affecting surface and root zone soil moisture, this work evaluates the control of soil constituents on root zone soil moisture. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated for characteristic time delay with sand, silt and clay percentage at different locations. Coupling between and trends of surface and root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crop locations are studied. The accuracy of estimated soil wetness index at 10 and 40 cm from two different satellite sensors at two different acquisition times (ascending and descending passes) is investigated by calculating the coefficient of determination, mean absolute error and mean biased error. This work highlights the significant difference in surface soil moisture estimation by two satellite sensors to derive root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crops. Coefficient of determination is more (âˆ¼0.9) for SMAP derived soil wetness index whereas it is lower (âˆ¼0.65) for AMSR-2 derived soil wetness index for both crops. Characteristic time delay variation is observed at two different times and at both the depths, with characteristic time delay increasing with depth. Also, at the descending pass characteristic time delay is lower as compared to the ascending pass. A strong relationship between root zone soil moisture and soil texture is observed. For rice crop, a positive correlation with sand and clay is observed for Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar locations having loam and sandy loam as the major soil class. And, for wheat locations, a positive correlation is observed for silt and clay for Uttar Pradesh locations and sand for Madhya Pradesh locations having loam and clay (light) soil texture. This work delivers essential information in understanding sustainable irrigation scheduling and increasing irrigation potential for rice and wheat crop locations. Having the knowledge of all the factors influencing crop cultivation and the derived root zone soil moisture, crop production can be optimized. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 40
SN  - 1807-8621
AB  - There is a lack of information about the effects of interactions among lime, phosphogypsum (PG) and fertilization on soil fertility and their effects on common bean yields in the tropics. This study aimed to determine the effects of annual application of PG and limestone and rates of fertilization on the chemical attributes of soil, fertilization efficiency, yield components and the grain yield of the common bean. The study was performed for three growing seasons in an acidic Oxisol. The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 4x4 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of lime, lime + PG, PG, and control (without corrective application) with four fertilization rates. In an acidic and low-fertility Cerrado soil, limestone or limestone + PG applied annually at 1/3 of the total rate in a no tillage system increased the common bean yield and the efficiency of the fertilization, although the improvement of the soil acidity indicators did not reach the desired levels. The application of soluble fertilizers to provide adequate and balanced amounts of nutrients provided greater yield gains and improved soil fertility compared to surface liming without fertilization, but the combination of the two practices resulted in the greatest benefits to both plant and soil fertility.

TI  - Long-term effects of manure and inorganic fertilizers on yield and soil fertility for a winter wheat-maize system in {Jiangsu}, {China
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Winter wheat-maize rotations are dominant cropping systems on the North China Plain, where recently the use of organic manure with grain crops has almost disappeared. This could reduce soil fertility and crop productivity in the long run. A 20-year field experiment was conducted to 1) assess the effect of inorganic and organic nutrient sources on yield and yield trends of both winter wheat and maize, 2) monitor the changes in soil organic matter content under continuous wheat-maize cropping with different soil fertility management schemes, and 3) identify reasons for yield trends observed in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, over a 20-year period. There were eight treatments applied to both wheat and maize seasons: a control treatment (C); three inorganic fertilizers, that is, nitrogen (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); and addition of farmyard manure (FYM) to these four treatments, that is, M, MN, MNP, and MNPK. At the end of the experiment the MN, MNP, and MNPK treatments had the highest yields, about 7 t wheat ha -1 and 7.5 t maize ha-1, with each about 1 t ha -1 more than the NPK treatments. Over 20 years with FYM soil organic matter increased by 80\% compared to only 10\% with NPK, which explained yield increases. However, from an environmental and agronomic perspective, manure application was not a superior strategy to NPK fertilizers. If manure was to be applied, though, it would be best applied to the wheat crop, which showed a better response than maize.

TI  - The effects of phytophagous insects on water and soil nutrient concentrations and fluxes through forest stands of the {Level} {II} monitoring network in the {UK
VL  - 409
SN  - NA
AB  - The effects of insect defoliators on throughfall and soil nutrient fluxes were studied in coniferous and deciduous stands at five UK intensive monitoring plots (1998 to 2008). Links were found between the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fluxes through the forest system to biological activity within the canopy. Underlying soil type determined the leaching or accumulation of these elements. Under oak, monitored at two sites, frass from caterpillars of Tortrix viridana and Operophtera brumata added direct deposition of 16kgha-1extra N during defoliation. Peaks of nitrate (NO3-N) flux between 5 and 9kgha-1 (Ã—5 usual winter values) were recorded in consecutive years in shallow soil waters. Synchronous rises in deep soil NO3-N fluxes at the Grizedale sandy site indicate downward flushing, not seen at the clay site. Under three Sitka spruce stands, generation of honeydew (DOC) was attributed to two aphid species (Elatobium abietinum and Cinara pilicornis) with distinctive feeding strategies. Throughfall DOC showed mean annual fluxes (6 seasons) 45-60kgha-1 compared with rainfall values of 14-22kgha-1. Increases of total N in throughfall and NO3-N fluxes in shallow soil solution were detected - soil water fluxes reached 8kgha-1 in Llyn Brianne, 25kgha-1 in Tummel, and 40kg NO3-Nha-1 in Coalburn. At Tummel, on sandy soil, NO3-N leaching showed increased concentration at depth, attributed to microbiological activity within the soil. By contrast, at Coalburn and Llyn Brianne, sites on peaty gleys, soil water NO3-N was retained mostly within the humus layer. Soil type is thus key to predicting N movement and retention patterns. These long term analyses show important direct and indirect effects of phytophagous insects in forest ecosystems, on above and below ground processes affecting tree growth, soil condition, vegetation and water quality.

TI  - Changes in soil fertility status of maize-wheat system due to long-term use of chemical fertilizers and amendments in an alfisol
VL  - 58
SN  - 1214-1178
AB  - The present study was undertaken to quantify changes in the status of soil nutrients, their depletion and build-up after continuous long intensive cropping for last 36 years in a permanent manorial trial which has been in progress since 1972 in an alfisol of western Himalayas. The rotation was maize-wheat which included various combinations of N, P, K, Zn and FYM (farmyard manure). Continuous cultivation influenced pH, OC (organic carbon), available N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus) and K (potassium). An increase in the status of organic carbon was observed in 100\% NPK + FYM treatments for more than three decades from initial value of 7.9 to 12.0 g/kg. The use of either FYM or lime alongwith 100\% NPK sustained crop productivity or improved nutrient status. However, imbalanced use of nutrients i.e. NP or N alone is adversely affecting the fertility of soil by aggravating the problem of soil acidity. Application of S free P fertilizer DAP (diammonium phosphate) drastically reduced the yield of both the crops. Thus, continuous use of balanced fertilizers is necessary for sustaining soil fertility and productivity of crops.

TI  - Importance of cover crops in alleviating negative effects of reduced soil tillage and promoting soil fertility in a winter wheat cropping system
VL  - 256
SN  - NA
AB  - Reduction of soil tillage is of paramount importance for agricultural soil preservation. However, it is often accompanied by yield reduction and weed management problems. In this perspective, cover crops could play an important role to alleviate weed infestation and sustain yield. In this study, the results from a three-year experiment of cover crop cultivation in different soil tillage treatments is presented, together with results from DayCent simulations on the long term evolution of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Eight cover crop treatments were set up as subtreatments in a long term experiment in Switzerland. Cover crops were cultivated for a short two-month period between two winter wheats. Substantial differences in cover crop growth were observed depending on cover crop species. In all tillage treatments, high cover crop biomass production allowed to supress weed biomass compared to the no cover crop control. Wheat grain yield was higher in the minimum tillage than in the plough treatment. In the no till treatment, wheat yield was notably low, except in the field pea treatments, where wheat yield reached values similar to that observed in the plough and minimum tillage treatments. In addition, these differences in biomass production translated into important differences in nutrient inputs, and even in soil nutrient concentration in some cases. Long term simulations showed that cover crop cultivation could increase drastically soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, especially in reduced tillage treatments. Altogether, these results demonstrated that the presence of a well-developed cover crop, even for only two months, allows to sustain wheat yield in a no till treatment. It impacts also soil fertility and nutrient cycling. This study shows that an accurate use and management of cover crops, in interaction with tillage reduction, could maintain yield and improve soil fertility in the long term. Â© 2018 The Authors

TI  - Weed and insect management alter soil arthropod densities, soil nutrient availability, plant productivity, and aphid densities in an annual legume cropping system
VL  - 130
SN  - NA
AB  - Transgenic glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is cultivated throughout the United States. Soybean growth is influenced by the presence of weeds, although managing non-crop vegetation can potentially impact soil arthropods, which are being increasingly recognized for their impacts on soil health, plant growth, and above-ground trophic interactions. We investigated how weed management (weedy controls, hand-weeded, glyphosate herbicide) and soil insecticide (chlorpyrifos) application affected densities of soil arthropods, soil nutrient availability, soybean growth and yield, and densities of an above-ground herbivore on sandy and clayey soils for two consecutive growing seasons. The soil insecticide treatment was intended to lower densities of subterranean arthropods to gain insight into how their presence influenced other factors, although their densities were primarily reduced the first year of the study. Surprisingly, weed management and soil insecticide use had virtually no interactive effects on any response. Weed presence had a positive effect on soil K at the sandy site and on nodule density per unit root. Negative effects of weed management on plant growth and aphids were related to the presence of weeds rather than herbicide use. Reduced soybean aphid density (at the clayey site) and soil P availability (at the sandy site) were associated with insecticide treated plots. Conversely, several measures of plant productivity, including number of nodules per unit root, and root and shoot biomass increased in +insecticide plots compared to other treatments, although effect strength depended on year and location. Collembola were the dominant soil microarthropod, and their densities in 2012 were negatively associated with nodule numbers in 2013. One explanatory hypothesis is that increased plant growth in plots treated with insecticide was caused by altered soil arthropod-microorganism interactions, possibly affecting arbuscular mycorrhizae function. This work highlights the importance of management decisions that affect soil arthropods in annual legume production systems. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of biochar amendment on net greenhouse gas emissions and soil fertility in a double rice cropping system: {A} 4-year field experiment
VL  - 262
SN  - NA
AB  - A 4-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biochar amendment on the net greenhouse gas emission (NGHGE), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), soil fertility and crop yield in a typical double rice cropping system in the central subtropics of China, from April 2012 to April 2016. Three biochar treatments were studied in this experiment, with application rates of 0, 24 and 48 t haâˆ’1 (named CK, LB and HB, respectively) using straw-derived biochar applied once at the beginning of the experiment. In each treatment, the fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) were measured using a static chamber/gas chromatography method. Major soil fertility properties were also determined throughout the experimental period. Biochar amendment was found to persistently decrease annual total CH4 emissions by 20 to 51\% in the four years, but increased the annual total N2O emissions and Rh by 150 to 190\% and 2 to 19\% in the first year and the following three years, respectively. On a 4-year average, biochar addition significantly reduced annual NGHGE and GHGI by 156 to 264\% and 159 to 278\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), with much higher reduction in the first year than those in the following three years (916 to 1911\% vs 24 to 51\%) due to soil carbon sequestration from biochar addition in the first year. The reduction of NGHGE and GHGI was mainly caused by the decrease of CH4 emissions (71 to 74\% contribution), and the increase of soil carbon sequestration (25 to 29\% contribution) in biochar treatments. Biochar amendment also significantly and persistently increased soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TSN), and total phosphorus (TSP) by 6 to 14\%, 33 to 61\%, 11 to 15\%, and 9 to 12\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), in the four years. Significant increases (p {\textless} 0.05) of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents were found only in the first year after biochar amendment. Soil pH was also increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) with biochar amendment, but showed a declining trend in the four years. Annual grain yields for the biochar treatments were enhanced by 1 to 13\%, with an average of 4 to 7\% in the four years, compared to CK (p = 0.07â€“0.26). Compared to the LB treatment, the HB treatment significantly decreased average NGHGE and GHGI, and significantly increased average soil pH value and TOC content, but there was no significantly difference in average TSN, TSP, and yield between LB and HB treatments (p {\textless} 0.05). The gross margin analysis by considering the profit from rice grain, gain for NGHGE, and cost for biochar indicated that the economical profit for the LB treatment might be higher than that for the CK and HB treatments. Our results suggest that addition of biochar at 24 t haâˆ’1 can be regarded as a consistently effective and economic measure for greenhouse gas emission mitigation, and soil fertility improvement, in the double rice cropping system.

VL  - 10
SN  - 2072-4292
AB  - High resolution root-zone soil moisture (SM) maps are important for understanding the spatial variability of water availability in agriculture, ecosystems research and water resources management. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can flexibly monitor land surfaces with thermal and optical imagery at very high spatial resolution (meter level, VHR) for most weather conditions. We modified the temperature-vegetation triangle approach to transfer it from satellite to UAS remote sensing. To consider the effects of the limited coverage of UAS mapping, theoretical dry/wet edges were introduced. The new method was tested on a bioenergy willow short rotation coppice site during growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. We demonstrated that by incorporating surface roughness parameters from the structure-from-motion in the interpretation of the measured land surface-atmosphere temperature gradients, the estimates of SM significantly improved. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured SM increased from not significant to 0.69 and the root mean square deviation decreased from 0.045 m(3).m(-3) to 0.025 m(3).m(-3) when considering temporal dynamics of surface roughness in the approach. The estimated SM correlated better with in-situ root-zone SM (15-30 cm) than with surface SM (0-5 cm) which is an important advantage over alternative remote sensing methods to estimate SM. The optimal spatial resolution of the triangle approach was found to be around 1.5 m, i.e. similar to the length scale of tree-crowns. This study highlights the importance of considering the 3-D fine scale canopy structure, when addressing the links between surface temperature and SM patterns via surface energy balances. Our methodology can be applied to operationally monitor VHR root-zone SM from UAS in agricultural and natural ecosystems.

TI  - Management of soil phosphorus fertility determines the phosphorus budget of a temperate grazing system and is the key to improving phosphorus efficiency
VL  - 212
SN  - NA
AB  - The phosphorus (P) efficiency of fertilised grazing systems on P deficient soils is often very low. P budgets (P input vs P output) were developed to examine P use in a long-term experiment in which grazing systems were managed with contrasting soil test P concentrations: (i) no P-fertiliser (P0; Olsen P = 2-5 mg/kg), (ii) near-optimum soil P fertility (P1; Olsen P = 10-15 mg/kg), (iii) supra-optimal P fertility (P2; Olsen P = 20-25 mg/kg), or (iv) with variable P fertility. Pastures were grazed with either 9 or 18 sheep/ha. P was exported as liveweight gain in sheep removed from the fields. Fertilised fields accumulated 89-93\% of their P input over the whole P-budgeting period (1994-2006). However, this included P that was contributing to a "build up" in soil fertility (1994-2000). The efficiency of P fertiliser use was better demonstrated by P budgets during a soil P fertility "maintenance" phase (2001-2006) in which P inputs and soil test P concentrations of the grazing system treatments were relatively stable. When the amounts of P associated with the small changes in soil fertility were accounted for, the accumulation of P was 43-52. kg P/ha (83-87\% of P inputs) in P1 fields and 87. kg P/ha (88\% of P inputs) in P2 fields over the six-year period. Differences due to stocking rate were relatively small. Audits of the total P in sheep camp soil and field soil demonstrated that sheep camps were not a major sink for the P that was accumulating in the grazed fields. P was mainly accumulated in soil in the non-camp area of fields when they were fertilised and this was the major reason for low P-balance efficiency. It was concluded that the annual rate of P accumulation in fertilised soil (due mainly to P-sorption reactions) was higher when soil is being maintained at higher extractable-P concentrations. Consequently, strategies that can achieve equivalent pasture production with lower concentrations of extractable-P in the soil should reduce the amount of P fertiliser necessary for high production.

TI  - A comparative study of integrated crop management system vs. conventional crop management system for cotton yield and fiber quality with respect to fruiting position under different soil fertility levels
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to increase cotton productivity and optimize fiber quality on limited arable land, an integrated crop management system (ICMS), which combined with some optimal management practices, is projected to replace the conventional crop management system (CCMS) for cotton production in the Yangtze River valley. The seedcotton yield and fiber quality with respect to fruiting position under ICMS and CCMS were investigated in 2012 and 2013 in two fields differing in soil fertility. Reduced bolls on fruiting branches 1â€“10 (FB1âˆ’10) and at fruiting position 1â€“2 (FP1âˆ’2) on FB11âˆ’15 could not be fully compensated by increased bolls on FB16+ under CCMS, resulting in more seedcotton yield under ICMS relative to that under CCMS. Fiber at majority fruiting positions under CCMS were longer and stronger than those under ICMS, but CCMS increased the contribution of bolls on FB11+ to the cotton yield, which overall resulted in no significant change in fiber length and strength by management system at field level. The number of bolls at FP1âˆ’2 on FB1âˆ’5 under CCMS while the number of bolls on FB1âˆ’5 and at FP1âˆ’2 on FB1âˆ’5 were not significantly changed by soil fertility, resulting in diminished yield difference in soil fertility among ICMS relative to that of CCMS. The high soil fertility significantly increased seedcotton yield relative to low soil fertility, which was attributed to more number of bolls on FB11+ and higher seedcotton weight per boll at all fruiting positions. High soil fertility field not only recorded superior fiber quality on FB11+, but also increased the contribution of these bolls to the cotton yield relative to those in the low soil fertility field, resulting in no significant change in overall fiber quality among soil fertility. These findings demonstrate that by combining optimal management practices on infertile soils ICMS could minimize the yield differences due to soil fertility without sacrificing fiber quality.

TI  - Reliable estimation of evapotranspiration on agricultural fields predicted by the {Priestley}-{Taylor} model using soil moisture data from ground and remote sensing observations compared with the {Common} {Land} {Model
VL  - 32
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial factor in understanding the hydrological cycle and is essential to many applications in hydrology, ecology and water resources management. However, reliable ET measurements and predictions for a range of temporal and spatial scales are difficult. This study focused on the comparison of ET estimates using a relatively simple model, the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) approach, and the physically based Common Land Model (CLM) using ground and remotely sensed soil moisture data as input. The results from both models were compared directly with hourly eddy covariance measurements at two agricultural field sites during the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) in the corn soybean production region in the Upper Midwest, USA. The P-T model showed a significant overestimation of the potential ET compared to the measurements, with a root mean square error (RMSE) between 115 and 130 W m(-2). Actual ET was better predicted by the CLM, with the RMSE ranging between 50 and 75 W m(-2). However, actual ET from the P-T model constrained with a soil moisture dependency parameterization showed improved results when compared to the measurements, with a significantly reduced bias and RMSE values between 60 and 65 W m(-2). This study suggests that even with a simple semi-empirical ET model, similar performance in estimating actual ET for agricultural crops compared to more complex land surface-atmosphere models (i.e. the CLM) can be achieved when constrained with the soil moisture function. This suggests that remote sensing soil moisture estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and others such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission may be effective alternatives under certain environmental conditions for estimating actual ET of agricultural crops using a fairly simple algorithm.

TI  - A comparison of two methods for estimating surface soil moisture based on the triangle model using optical/thermal infrared remote sensing over the source area of the {Yellow} {River
VL  - 40
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - As an important surface parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a significant role in water resources management, crop growth, land degradation, and vegetation coverage as well as global climate change studies. In particular, the triangle model based on the spatial relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index from optical/thermal infrared remote sensing data has been widely used for the estimation of SSM. In the present study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data, including the MOD11A2 LST and MOD13A2 normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) from July to October, 2008 to 2010, over the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau, are selected to construct the LST/NDVI triangle space. Two methods based on the triangle space, namely, the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) method and second order polynomial method, is used to estimate the SSM at the regional scale. Finally, an analysis between the estimated SSM and ground-measured SSM is carried out to explore not only the quality of these two methods in triangle space but also the applicability of these two methods in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the spatial distribution of SSM in the study area is investigated. The results of the validation of the estimated SSM results using ground-measured data show that the accuracy of the second order polynomial method is significantly higher than that of the TVDI method. The TVDI method root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.072m(3)m(-3), coefficient of determination R-2 is 0.461, and bias is -0.022m(3)m(-3), while the second order polynomial method RMSE is 0.075m(3)m(-3), R-2 is 0.519, and bias is 0.007m(3)m(-3). Moreover, the SSM decreases from west to the east; this distribution can be obtained with the estimated results by using either of the two methods. In addition, the SSM estimations by using the two methods are in good correlation with the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product. The present study indicates that the second order polynomial method can simulate the change in SSM in the triangle space more realistically and effectively and that the second order polynomial method is more suitable for the estimation of SSM over the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Diversification of rice with pigeonpea in a rice-wheat cropping system on a {Typic} {Ustochrept}: {Effect} on soil fertility, yield and nutrient use efficiency
VL  - 92
SN  - NA
AB  - Continuous adoption of rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) has led to depletion of inherent soil fertility resulting in a serious threat to its sustainability in the Indo-Gangetic plain region (IGPR) of India. The inclusion of legumes in RWCS assumes a great significance to restore soil fertility. But farmers in the IGPR rarely grow legumes in the system. We, therefore, carried out farmers' participatory diagnostic survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers' fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend Fiori \& Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan(L.)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in UGP grew pigeonpea in place of rice under RWCS as only a break crop at a 2-3 year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha-1 and 24 kg P ha-1 to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha -1 and 19 kg P ha-1 to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t ha-1) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha-1). The survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29Â°4â€² N), Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years (1998-1999 to 2000-2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of wheat. In 1998-1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after rice, but improved significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) by 11.4-15.1\% in pigeonpea plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate, and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat harvest NO3-N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly greater under rice-wheat system than under pigeonpea-wheat system, suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3-N leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha-1, NO3-N beyond 45 cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased, especially in the 30-45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the system not only helped maintaining soil BD at initial level in the surface (0-15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p {\textless} 0.05) BD in sub-surface layers (15-30 cm and 30-45 cm). Compared to rice, a statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on root volume (58\%) and root weight (99.5\%) of succeeding wheat was also recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea-wheat system were greater compared with rice-wheat system. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Productivity, nutrient uptake and post-harvest soil fertility as influenced by cotton-based cropping system with integrated nutrient management practices in semi-arid tropics
VL  - 60
SN  - NA
AB  - Field experiments were conducted on cotton to evaluate the different cotton-based intercropping system along with balanced nutrient management practices on enhancing cotton productivity. Cropping systems have been considered as main plots and nutrient management practices have been considered as subplots. The results showed that cotton + onion system recorded the highest cotton equivalent yield (CEY) of 2052 and 1895 kg ha-1 which was on par with cotton intercropped with dhaincha, which recorded 2010 and 1894 kg of CEY ha-1 in both the seasons. Combined application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants (S5) registered highest CEY in both the seasons. Cotton intercropped with dhaincha (M2) recorded highest uptake of N, P, and K. Among the nutrient management practices, application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants (S5) showed highest uptake of N, P, and K. A similar trend was noticed in the post-harvest soil fertility too and it is significantly higher under cotton + dhaincha and application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants treatment compared to 100\% recommend NPK alone. It could be concluded from these results that crop productivity can be improved and soil fertility status can be sustained with integrated plant nutrient management practices.

VL  - 48

AB  - A study on the long-term effect of fertilizers and amendments on crop productivity and changes in soil fertility in maize-wheat cropping system in an acid Alfisol was carried out in randomized block design (RBD) with 11 treatments. Continuous application of chemical fertilizers along with farmyard manure (FYM) or lime significantly influenced the grain and straw/stover yield and the uptake of nutrients by wheat and maize crops significantly. The organic carbon content increased from 7.9 to 12.1 g kgâˆ’1, cation exchange capacity (CEC) from 12.1 to 14.6 cmol (p+) kgâˆ’1 and available phosphorus from 21.9 to 75.2 kg haâˆ’1 through the integrated use of organic and fertilizers for the last 42 years while the status of available nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) declined over the years in all the treatments. Continuous application of urea alone resulted in a drastic decline in soil pH at both depths. Imbalanced use of fertilizers led to a significant reduction in the productivity of both crops and depleted the soil fertility. Â© 2017 Taylor \& Francis.

AB  - Optimal soil moisture estimation may be characterized by intercomparisons among remotely sensed measurements, ground-based measurements, and land surface models. In this study, we compared soil moisture from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E), ground-based measurements, and a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model for the Soil Moisture Experiments in 2003 (SMEX03) Little River region, Georgia. The Common Land Model (CLM) reasonably replicated soil moisture patterns in dry down and wetting after rainfall though it had modest wet biases (0.001-0.054 m3/m 3) as compared to AMSR-E and ground data. While the AMSR-E average soil moisture agreed well with the other data sources, it had extremely low temporal variability, especially during the growing season from May to October. The comparison results showed that highest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.054 and 0.059 m3/m3 for short and long periods, respectively. Even if CLM and AMSR-E had complementary strengths, low MAE (0.018-0.054 m3/m3) and RMSE (0.023-0.059 m3/m3) soil moisture errors for CLM and soil moisture low biases (0.003-0.031 m3/m3) for AMSR-E, care should be taken prior to employing AMSR-E retrieved soil moisture products directly for hydrological application due to its failure to replicate temporal variability. AMSR-E error characteristics identified in this study should be used to guide enhancement of retrieval algorithms and improve satellite observations for hydrological sciences.

TI  - Improving land surface soil moisture and energy flux simulations over the {Tibetan} plateau by the assimilation of the microwave remote sensing data and the {GCM} output into a land surface model
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - The land surface soil moisture is a crucial variable in weather and climate models. This study presents a land data assimilation system (LDAS) that aims to improve the simulation of the land surface soil moisture and energy fluxes by merging the microwave remote sensing data and the general circulation model (GCM) output into a land surface model (LSM). This system was applied over the Tibetan Plateau, using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data as forcing data and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers for EOS (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures as an observation. The performance of our four data sources, which were NCEP, AMSR-E, LDAS and simulations of Simple Biosphere Model 2 (SiB2), was assessed against 5 months of in situ measurements that were performed at two stations: Gaize and Naqu. For the surface soil moisture, the LDAS simulations were superior to both NCEP and SiB2, and there was more than a one-third reduction in the root mean squared errors (RMSE) for both of the stations. Compared with the AMSR-E soil moisture retrievals, the LDAS simulations were comparable at the Gaize station, and they were superior at the Naqu station. For the whole domain intercomparison, the results showed that the LDAS simulation of the soil moisture field was more realistic than the NCEP and SiB2 simulations and that the LDAS could estimate land surface states properly even in the regions where AMSR-E failed to cover and/or during the periods that the satellite did not overpass. For the surface energy fluxes, the LDAS estimated the latent heat flux with an acceptable accuracy (RMSE less than 35W/m2), with a one-third reduction in the RMSE from the SiB2. For the 5-month whole plateau simulation, the LDAS produced a much more reasonable Bowen Ratio than the NCEP, and it also generated a clear contrast of the land surface status over the plateau, which was wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest, during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Because the LDAS only uses globally available data sets, this study reveals the potential of the LDAS to improving the land surface energy and water flux simulations in ungauged and/or poorly gauged regions.

TI  - Effects of conservation tillage and nutrient management practices on soil fertility and productivity of rice ({Oryza} sativa {L}.)-rice system in {North} eastern region of {India
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Over centuries and even today, traditional farming practices are well performed without any ecological degradation. However, management practice such as conservative tillage combined with nutrient and residue could increase the crop production as well as soil fertility. A three-year replicated study was conducted to assess the effects of agronomic modification of traditional farming practices on productivity and sustainability of rice (wet season)-rice (dry season) system (RRS). The replacement of farmers practice (T2) with conservation effective tillage (no-till (NT)) and integrated nutrient management (INM) practice along with 30\% residue retention (T5) enhanced the straw, root and biomass yield of both wet season rice (WR), dry season rice (DR) and system as a whole over T2. Treatment T5 recorded significantly lower soil bulk density (Ïb) and higher pH than the T2 after three years of the experiment. Further, treatment T5 increased total soil organic carbon (2.8\%), total soil organic carbon stock (2.8\%), carbon sequestration rate (336.5 kg ha-1 year-1), cumulative carbon stock (142.9\%) and carbon retention efficiency (141.0\%) over T2 of 0-20 cm depth after three year. The soil microbial biomass carbon concentration was significantly the highest under T5. Similarly, the dehydrogenase activity was the maximum under T5. Adoption of conservation tillage and nutrient management practice involving NT and INM along with residue retention can enhance the system productivity, and C and N sequestration in paddy soils is thereby contributing to the sustainability of the RRS.

TI  - Productivity and soil fertility of the rice-wheat system in the {High} {Ganges} {River} {Floodplain} of {Bangladesh} is influenced by the inclusion of legumes and manure
VL  - 218
SN  - NA
AB  - Productivity of the rice-wheat system is critical to the food security of Bangladesh. However, many concerns about the sustainability of this system exist because of low soil organic matter (SOM). In this context, an experiment was performed in the agro-ecological zone of the High Ganges River Floodplain (HGRF) at the Regional Wheat Research Centre (RWRC), Rajshahi of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) over two consecutive years, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. The experiment evaluated the productivity and changes in soil fertility of the wheat-rice cropping sequence as influenced by an integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS) and through the inclusion of legume crops. Two factors were considered: cropping sequence and IPNS treatment. A legume crop was fitted to the existing wheat-rice sequence, resulting in four cropping sequences: wheat-mungbean-rice, wheat-blackgram-rice, wheat-dhaincha-rice and wheat-fallow-rice. There were six fertilizer/manure treatments: 100\% recommended artificial fertilizer, farmers' practice (FP) and four IPNS treatments. The IPNS treatments comprised two rates of poultry manure (PM; 3 and 6 t ha-1) and cowdung (CD; 5 and 10 t ha-1). For the IPNS treatments, 100\% nutrient rates were adjusted with manure (PM and CD) and artificial fertilizers. The inclusion of legumes in the wheat-rice cropping sequence, particularly the use of mungbean, resulted in the highest productivity. This system rendered 57\% higher wheat equivalent yield (WEY) than the wheat-fallow-rice cropping sequence. The incorporation of legume residues into the soil increased SOM, total N, available P and available Zn, but exchangeable K and available S were depleted under all crop rotations. The simultaneous use of chemical fertilizer and organic manure (OM; PM and CD) with the IPNS approach resulted in higher crop productivity and system WEY as well as higher rates of OM, especially IPNS with 6tha-1 PM. This indicates that chemical fertilizers alone could not provide adequate and balanced nutrition for potential yield of the tested crops. SOM, total N, available P and available Zn improved in treatments that included OM (both PM and CD) but the increment was greater in the combination of IPNS with higher rates of both OMs in the wheat-dhaincha-rice cropping sequence. K and S decreased in all nutrient treatments compared to initial soil. The wheat-mungbean-rice cropping sequence under IPNS with OM (especially 3-6 t ha-1 PM) resulted in best crop productivity (wheat, 4.55; rice, 5.48; WEY of mungbean, 4.54 and system WEY, 13.19 t ha-1) in both years.

VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - The impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), inorganic phosphorus (P), and irrigation regimes was studied in an okra (Abelmoschus esculentus)â€“pea (Pisum sativum) cropping system in an acidic Alfisol. Experimentation was carried out at Palampur, India, in a randomized bock design (RBD), replicated three times with fourteen treatments comprising AM fungi (Glomus mosseae), inorganic phosphorus (50, 75, and 100\% soil-test-based recommended P dose), irrigation regimes (at 40 and 80\% available water capacity), generalized recommended NPK and irrigations (GRD), and farmersâ€™ practice. Effects of AM fungi on plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and dry-matter accumulation (DMA) were nominal at early crop growth stage, i.e., 50 DAS (days after sowing). However, at 100 DAS, AMF imbedded treatments led to higher plant height (4\%), LAI (3\%), and DMA (6\%) in okra, whereas in pea the magnitude of increase in these parameters following AMF inoculation was 6, 5, and 8\%, respectively, over non-AMF counterparts. AMF + 75\% soil-test-based P dose at either of these irrigation regimes gave statistically similar yields in both okra and pea as that obtained under 100\% soil-test-based P dose at either of two irrigation regimes, thus indicating an economy of about 25\% in soil-test-based P dose. Regarding nutrient harvest index in okra and pea, statistically similar values were registered with most nutrients under both AMF inoculated and non-AMF counterparts. In the case of okra, P harvest index was registered less by 3\% with AMF inoculation; however, its magnitude increased by 3\% in pea following AMF inoculation compared to non-AMF counterparts at similar levels of P and irrigation. At completion of two cycles of okra-pea system, AMF imbedded treatments did not alter available soil nutrient status significantly in comparison to non-AMF counterparts. Overall, current study suggests that practice of AMF inoculation has great potential in enhancing growth parameters for better productivity, fertilizer-P economy, and nutrient harvest efficiency in okra-pea production system in Himalayan acidic Alfisol.

VL  - 57
SN  - NA
AB  - Wind erosion is a major contributor to desertification in the Sahel. Although three effective countermeasures for wind erosion (i.e. ridging, mulching with post-harvest crop residue, and windbreaks) have been proposed, they are not practical for Sahelian farmers. Therefore, we designed a new land management practice, termed the "Fallow Band System," which can be used for both controlling wind erosion and improving soil fertility and crop production. This method does not impose additional expense and labor requirements on Sahelian farmers who are economically challenged and have limited manpower. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of this system on wind-erosion control and soil-fertility improvement. We conducted field experiments at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics West and Central Africa and showed that (i) a fallow band can capture 74\% of wind-blown soil particles and 58\% of wind-blown coarse organic matter, which suggests that it can effectively control wind erosion, (ii) the amount of soil nutrients available for crops in a former fallow band was increased by the decomposition of trapped soil materials containing considerable amounts of nutrients, and (iii) the amount of soil water available for crops in a former fallow band was increased by the trapped wind-blown soil materials through improvement of rainwater infiltration into surface soil. These results lead to the conclusion that the "Fallow Band System" can be useful for preventing desertification and improving soil fertility in the Sahel, West Africa.

TI  - Residual effects of lime and sewage sludge inputs on soil fertility and tree and pasture production in a {Pinus} radiata {D}. {Don} silvopastoral system established in a very acidic soil
VL  - 161
SN  - NA
AB  - In Galician (Spain) silvopastoral systems, nutrient availability to the pasture and trees can be limited by soil acidity. Liming and fertilisation with sewage sludge could enhance the productivity of silvopastoral systems (including understory and trees) by increasing Ca and reducing Al in the soil. This study evaluated changes in soil chemical properties, tree growth and understory production in test plots, both limed and unlimed, in a silvopastoral system located on an acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don. This research compared the effects of different doses of sewage sludge (160, 320 and 480kg total Nha -1) with the effects of mineral fertilisation (8\% N - 24\% P 2O 5 - 16\% K 2O) and no fertilisation. The initial lime applications improved soil fertility (increasing soil pH, effective exchange capacity, and the saturation percentage of Ca and reducing the saturation percentage of Al) more than the sewage sludge. However, the most significant effects of sewage sludge were found over the long term after high doses of sewage sludge were applied (480kg total Nha -1). Therefore, the use of sewage sludge as a fertiliser improves both soil fertility and the productivity of silvopastoral systems in the long term as long as an adequate disposal of this residue is guaranteed.

VL  - 41
SN  - NA
AB  - We analyzed data from a long-term riceâ€“wheat cropping sequence to evaluate the effects of integrated nutrient management (INM) on yield trends and sustainability, nutrient balance and soil fertility of the system. After 30th cycle, grain yield of both the crops significantly declined under control and highest rice and wheat grain yields were obtained when 50\% N supplied through green manure and farm yard manure, respectively. The magnitude of yield slope under INM was found considerably higher than 100\% recommended fertilizer (RDF). Sustainable yield index (SYI) for both the crops were found lower in control but considerably higher with the 100\% RDF and under INM. The soils under all the treatments suffered an apparent loss of K and N (except where organics replacing 50\% N). Correlation study also reveals K is the sole factor for the yield sustainability as apparent K balance was negatively correlated with SYI and yield slope.

VL  - 136
SN  - NA
AB  - We studied the long-term effect of nutrient management on soil fertility and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools under a 6-year-old pearl millet-wheat cropping system in an Inceptisol of subtropical India. Significant build-up in soil fertility in terms of alkaline KMnO 4-N, Olsen-P, NH 4OAc-K and CaCl 2-S as well as SOC pools namely, total organic carbon (TOC), Walkley and Black organic carbon (WBC), labile organic carbon (LBC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were maintained under FYM and integrated nutrient management involving FYM and NPK than unfertilized control plot in 0-15 and 15-30cm soil depths. The highest values of TOC (11.48gkg -1) and WBC (7.86gkg -1) were maintained in FYM treated plot, while the highest values of LBC (1.36gkg -1) and MBC (273mgkg -1) were found in FYM+NPK. The magnitude of change in pools of SOC in sub-surface (15-30cm) soil was low as compared to the surface soil (0-15cm). Significant increase in all the pools of SOC in FYM treated plots indicates the importance of application of organic manure like FYM in maintaining organic carbon in soil. Highly strong relationships were exhibited between LBC and MBC with yield, indicating that these pools are more important for nutrient turn-over and their availability to plants than total SOC. Carbon management index revealed that integrated nutrient management could be followed for enhancing crop productivity, nutrient availability and soil carbon pools for long-term. These results conclude that for sustainable crop production and maintaining soil quality, input of organic manure like FYM is of major importance and should be advocated in the nutrient management of intensive cropping system for improving soil fertility and biological properties of soils.

AB  - A long-term experiment was conducted at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture for 13 years to evaluate the effect of low tillage cum cheaper conjunctive nutrient management practices in terms of productivity, soil fertility, and nitrogen chemical pools of soil under sorghumâ€“mung bean system in Alfisol soils. The results of the study clearly revealed that sorghum and mung bean grain yield as influenced by low tillage and conjunctive nutrient management practices varied from 764 to 1792 and 603 to 1008 kg haâˆ’1 with an average yield of 1458 and 805 kg haâˆ’1 over a period of 13 years, respectively. Of the tillage practices, conventional tillage (CT) maintained 11.0\% higher yields (1534 kg haâˆ’1) over the minimum tillage (MT) (1382 kg haâˆ’1) practice. Among the conjunctive nutrient management treatments, the application of 2 t Gliricidia loppings + 20 kg nitrogen (N) through urea to sorghum crop recorded significantly highest grain yield of 1712 kg haâˆ’1 followed by application of 4 t compost + 20 kg N through urea (1650 kg haâˆ’1) as well as 40 kg N through urea alone (1594 kg haâˆ’1). Similar to sorghum, in case of mung bean also, CT exhibited a significant influence on mung bean grain yields (888 kg haâˆ’1) which was 6.7\% higher compared to MT (832 kg haâˆ’1). Among all the conjunctive nutrient management treatments, 2 t compost + 10 kg N through urea and 2 t compost + 1 t Gliricidia loppings performed significantly well and recorded similar mung bean grain yields of 960 kg haâˆ’1 followed by 1 t Gliricidia loppings + 10 kg N through urea (930 kg haâˆ’1). The soil nitrogen chemical fractions (SNCFs) were also found to be significantly influenced by tillage and conjunctive nutrient management treatments. Further, a significant correlation of SNCF with total soil nitrogen was observed. In the correlation study, it was also observed that N fraction dynamically played an important role in enhancing the availability pool of N in soil and significantly influenced the yield of sorghum grain and mung bean.

TI  - AHFO}-based soil water content sensing technology considering soil-sensor thermal contact resistance
VL  - 16
SN  - 1674-7755
AB  - The actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) technology has become emerged as a research focus due to its advantages of distributed, real-time measurement and good durability. These attributes have led to the gradual application of AHFO technology to the water content measurement of in situ soil. However, all existing in situ applications of AHFO technology fail to consider the effect of soil-sensor contact quality on water content measurements, limiting potential for the wider application of AHFO technology. To address this issue, the authors propose a method for determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance based on the principle of an infinite cylindrical heat source. This is then used to establish an AHFO water content measurement technology that considers the thermal contact resistance. The reliability and validity of the new measurement technology are explored through a laboratory test and a field case study, and the spatial-temporal evolution of the soil water content in the case is revealed. The results demonstrate that method for determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance is highly effective and applicable to all types of soils. This method requires only the moisture content, dry density, and thermal response of the in situ soil to be obtained. In the field case, the measurement error of soil water content between the AHFO method, which takes into account the thermal contact resistance, and the neutron scattering method is only 0.011. The water content of in situ soil exhibits a seasonal variation, with an increase in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer and winter. Furthermore, the response of shallow soils to precipitation and evaporation is significant. These findings contribute to the enhancement of the accuracy of the AHFO technology in the measurement of the water content of in situ soils, thereby facilitating the dissemination and utilization of this technology.

TI  - A modified soil water content measurement technique using actively heated fiber optic sensor
VL  - 12
SN  - 1674-7755
AB  - Soil water content measurement is critical in practical engineering. The actively heated fiber Bragg grating optic sensor (FBGS) has great potential of multi-point measurement for soil water content measurement in field. In this study, the effect of heating time on the measurement accuracy is discussed, and modifications are made for actively heated fiber optic (AHFO) sensors. The results demonstrate that if an integration data analysis method is used, the accuracy and reliability of soil water content measurement with AHFO sensors will be improved. Both a short fiber length and a short-term heating pattern are effective and can help to reduce soil disturbance. With the proposed integration method, a short heating time is guaranteed for measuring the soil water content. Such improvements will reduce the thermal disturbance to soil sample and improve the reliability of measurement. (C) 2020 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture sensing is one of the most important components in smart agriculture. It plays a critical role in increasing crop yields and reducing water waste. However, existing commercial soil moisture sensors are either expensive or inaccurate, limiting their real-world deployment. In this paper, we utilize wide-Area LoRa signals to sense soil moisture without a need of dedicated soil moisture sensors. Different from traditional usage of LoRa in smart agriculture which is only for sensor data transmission, we leverage LoRa signal itself as a powerful sensing tool. The key insight is that the dielectric permittivity of soil which is closely related to soil moisture can be obtained from phase readings of LoRa signals. Therefore, antennas of a LoRa node can be placed in the soil to capture signal phase readings for soil moisture measurements. Though promising, it is non-Trivial to extract accurate phase information due to unsynchronization of LoRa transmitter and receiver. In this work, we propose to include a low-cost switch to equip the LoRa node with two antennas to address the issue. We develop a delicate chirp ratio approach to cancel out the phase offset caused by transceiver unsynchronization to extract accurate phase information. The proposed system design has multiple unique advantages including high accuracy, robustness against motion interference and large sensing range for large-scale deployment in smart agriculture. Experiments with commodity LoRa nodes show that our system can accurately estimate soil moisture at an average error of 3.1\%, achieving a performance comparable to high-end commodity soil moisture sensors. Field studies show that the proposed system can accurately sense soil moisture even when the LoRa gateway is 100 m away from the LoRa node, enabling wide-Area soil moisture sensing for the first time.

TI  - A pipeline robot system for monitoring soil water content distribution
VL  - 620
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil water content (SWC) distribution is crucial for better understanding soil water dynamics and accurate hydrological modeling. In this study, a pipeline robot system for monitoring SWC distribution is designed to improve the current technical problems of insufficient measurement distance and low positioning accuracy of the existing SWC monitoring platform. The system consists of a pipeline robot, a fixed base station and a PVC pipe. The robot could fit into a 55-mm-diameter PVC pipe to measure SWC distribution horizontally, vertically, or at any angle to the horizontal direction. The base station serves as a data collector and also supplies power and distance information for recharging and positioning the robot, respectively. A series of tests for evaluating the performance of the pipeline robot system were conducted. Field experiments were also conducted to monitor soil water infiltration and horizontal distribution of SWC of crop root zone at three plots. The results showed that the minimum radius of volume of sensitivity of the dielectric sensor is about 2.25 cm. The robot for mobile measurement performed stable both in horizontal and vertical directions and the response of the dielectric sensor output to different dielectric materials is significant. The accumulated error of the encoder is effectively decreased from 4.3\% to 1.2\% by correcting the position error using the laser ranging sensor. The measured SWCs during the calibration experiment were highly correlated with those obtained by the drying method (R2 = 0.990 and RMSE = 0.0181 cm3 cmâˆ’3). The results of the field experiments demonstrated that the system is feasible for monitoring soil water infiltration in the vertical direction and SWC distributions of crop root zone horizontally at the three plots, indicating that the potential application of the developed system for long-term monitoring of SWC distribution under field conditions in the near future.

TI  - Soil {Moisture} {Measurement} by the {Dielectric} {Method
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract: Measuring soil moisture by the dielectric method is considered. It was revealed that the complex dielectric permeability (CDP) affects the readings of sensors using different physical principles in different ways. The results of CDP measurements for six samples are given: river sand, bentonite, three samples of Haplic Chernozem (Loamic) of the Omsk region and a mixture of chernozemic material and river sand. Content of particles less than 0.01 mm in size in the samples varied from 1.7 to 72\%; the content of organic carbon ranged from 0 to 4.12\%. Measurements of CDP were performed at different values of moisture at the frequencies from 10 kHz to 4â€“8 GHz in the same cell using the original technique developed by authors. It was noted that at frequencies below 20â€“30 MHz, the dielectric permittivity is an ambiguous function of moisture owing to the strong influence of the conductivity of the soil solution and of interlayer dielectric relaxation on it. Moisture measurements are best to perform in the frequency range 0.5â€“3 GHz, where the effect of interlayer relaxation and soil solution conductivity on the CDP is negligible. Measurements of soil moisture and conductivity were performed using a Decagon 5TE capacitive sensor. The calibration dependency that is valid for different soils, considering the conductivity of the soil measured by this sensor was found. The error of moisture measurements using this dependency is 0.035 m3/m3. The use of individual calibration dependencies for each of soils reduces the error to 0.014 m3/m3. Results of the work can be used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture measurement by the dielectric method. Â© 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

TI  - A compact magnetic resonance system with inside-out sensor for soil moisture measurement
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate measurement of soil moisture parameters plays a vital role in promoting agricultural production. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measuring instruments have become increasingly compact, especially in low field applications. However, NMR soil moisture measurement instruments still have problems with portability. We report on a compact NMR measuring instrument that focuses on the circuit's design and construction. The instrument includes an inside-out sensor, NMR spectrometer, radio frequency power amplifier, low-noise preamplifier, and duplexer. They are integrated into a slim 3D-printed cylinder. The integrated NMR instrument is portable and user-friendly and can reduce the influence of nonideal factors, such as transmission line effects and electromagnetic interference. We conducted different soil moisture experiments with the prototype using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence to obtain the corresponding transverse relaxation time (T 2) decay curves. Then, the T 2 1D spectrum distributions were obtained by inverse Laplace transformation. Finally, the results reveal that the area of long T 2 component decreases as the soil moisture content decreases. Â© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents a highly sensitive differential soil moisture sensor (DSMS) using a microstrip line loaded with triangular two-turn resonator (T2-SR) and complementary of the rectangular two-turn spiral resonator (CR2-SR), simultaneously. Volumetric Water Content (VWC) or permittivity sensing is conducted by loading the T2-SR side with dielectric samples. Two transmission notches are observed for identical loads relating to T2-SR and CR2-SR. The CR2-SR notch at 4.39 GHz is used as a reference for differential permittivity measurement method. Further, the resonance frequency of T2-SR is measured relative to the reference value. Based on this frequency difference, the permittivity of soil is calculated which is related to the soil VWC. Triangular two-turn resonator (T2-SR) resonance frequency changes from 4 to 2.38 GHz when VWC varies 0\% to 30\%. The sensor's operation principle is described through circuit model analysis and simulations. To validate the differential sensing concept, prototype of the designed 3-cell DSMS is fabricated and measured. The proposed sensor exhibits frequency shift of 110 MHz for 1\% change at the highest soil moisture content (30\%) for sandy-type soil. This work proves the differential microwave sensing concept for precision agriculture. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - This article presents a new soil moisture monitoring system (SMMS) for precision agriculture applications. The system consists of a metamaterial-inspired microwave sensor and an electronic backend. The sensor was built on a biodegradable dielectric substrate, emphasizing sustainability, and uses a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) coupled to a microstrip line for excitation. This resonator, being a planar artificial structure with metamaterial properties, exhibits composite left/right-handed propagation, thereby displaying sensitivity to the dielectric constant of the applied medium. Accordingly, the sensing mechanism involves establishing a correlation between the soil moisture content and the relative displacement of the sensor's resonance frequency, which varies as the soil's dielectric constant changes due to moisture variations. The backend is controlled by an ESP32 module, which fulfills the tasks of signal capture, processing the data, and delivering the corresponding soil moisture. The transmission of data occurs via Wi-Fi using the MQ telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. To ensure accuracy, the sensor was calibrated using a gravimetric-based method for sandy and clay soil types. A curve-fitting model was extracted, exhibiting remarkable precision (R2 = 0.997), enabling the system to detect moisture levels from 0\% to 20\% for both soil types. The overall relative error was found to be 3.6\% for sand and 8.3\% for clay. Finally, the results obtained from the evaluation of the system in typical sandy soil conditions are presented. The system demonstrated its effectiveness by continuously detecting moisture levels ranging from 5\% to 11\% over a duration of 33 h, thereby confirming its viability for practical implementation.

AB  - Development and deployment of sensing technologies is one of the main steps in achieving sustainability in crop production through precision agriculture. Key sensing methodologies developed for monitoring soil moisture and nutrients with recent advances in the sensing devices reported in literature using those techniques are overviewed in this article. The soil moisture determination has been divided into four main sections describing soil moisture measurement metrics and laboratory-based testing, followed by in-situ, remote and proximal sensing techniques. The application, advantages and limitations for each of the mentioned technologies are discussed. The nutrient monitoring methods are reviewed beginning with laboratory-based methods, ion-selective membrane based sensors, bio-sensors, spectroscopy-based methods, and capillary electrophoresis-based systems for inorganic ion detection. Attention has been given to the core principle of detection while reporting recent sensors developed using the mentioned concepts. The latest works reported on the different sensing methodologies point towards the trend of developing low-cost, easy to use, field-deployable or portable sensing systems aimed towards improving technology adoption in crop production leading to efficient site-specific soil and crop management which in turn will bring us closer to reaching sustainability in the practice of agriculture.

TI  - Monitoring near-surface soil water content using an innovative perforated cylinder coaxial dielectric sensor
VL  - 573
SN  - NA
AB  - Near-surface soil water content (NSWC) is an important parameter for characterizing hydrological processes, water and vapor exchange at the soil-atmosphere boundary, and potential biological productivity. Here we develop a dielectric based frequency-domain (FD) impedance sensor operating at 100 MHz, with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board. This perforated cylinder coaxial (PCC) sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and of temperature. The temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water. We characterize the performance of the PCC sensor and compare it with alternative 3-pin- and 2-pin-electrode FD impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board. A series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted, including (i) sensors calibration, (ii) temperature effects and their correction, (iii) soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal (SSR) test and (iv) accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the NSWC measurements. The calibration results verified that the PCC, 3-pin and 2-pin probes were suitable to measure VSWC (RMSE â‰¤ 0.0142 cm3 cmâˆ’3). The simulation analysis using High Frequency Structure Simulator software (HFSS) indicated that the novel PCC probe had a symmetrical distribution of the E-field, wholly contained within the cylinder, avoiding leakage of the E-Field into air at the soil-atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on VSWC. The results of the SSR test showed that the E-field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the PCC probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin-type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on VSWC (i.e. up to 8 mm for 3-pin and up to 11 mm for 2-pin designs when VSWC {\textgreater} 0.17 cm3 cmâˆ’3), which corresponds to the simulation analysis. Moreover, the new PCC probe provided more accurate NSWC measurement than 3-pin or 2-pin probes because the E-field was contained within the perforated cylinder, avoiding E-field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of VSWC. The pin-structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Inversion method for soil moisture content based on a distributed fiber optic acoustic sensing system.
VL  - 31
SN  - 1094-4087
AB  - The traditional measurement method can't achieve real-time monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) within a two-dimensional area. To solve the above  problems, we propose a rapid SMC monitoring method for two-dimensional area based  on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). DAS demodulates the backward Rayleigh  scattering signal containing seismic wave sound velocity information from the  active seismic source. The folding ruler approximation is employed to calculate  the sound velocity of the soil, which is then inverted to determine the soil  moisture content. The experiment measured the soil within a two-dimensional area  formed by the seismic source and the acoustic sensing optical cable. The sensing  optical cable and the active seismic source are organized into a two-dimensional  area and the measurement range is 3â€‰Ã—â€‰10 m with 33 points. The SMC ranges from  15\% to 40\%. The experiment shows that the absolute error between the measured  values obtained by DAS and the water cut meter is 7\%. This experiment verifies  the feasibility of using the Rayleigh scattering properties to invert SMC and  provides a new method for real-time monitoring of SMC in a large area.

TI  - A method of electrical conductivity compensation in a low-cost soil moisture sensing measurement based on capacitance
VL  - 150
SN  - NA
AB  - The detection of soil moisture is one of the most important researches in the development of precision agriculture. At present, the detection of soil dielectric constant is the most effective and convenient method to measure soil moisture content. Most of the dielectric type soil moisture sensors reduce the influence of soil salinity, texture and other factors on the measurement by detecting at high frequency. However, this will increase the production cost of the measurement circuit and fail to meet the requirements for large-scale deployment of sensors in agricultural production. The method of low-frequency capacitance detection has a price advantage but a low measurement accuracy, thus the application is very limited. This paper intends to improve the measurement accuracy and application range of low-frequency capacitance moisture sensors by correcting the relationship between low-frequency capacitance and moisture through the detection of soil conductivity. Three modified models (logistic, exponential and polynomial) to estimate the moisture content was verified by comparing with the oven-drying method calibration value. The results indicated that the MAME and MAE of the logistic model was less than 3.55\% and 2.50\%, respectively, which can satisfy most agricultural production requirements for soil moisture detection. Therefore, the study provided an effective detection method for low-cost soil moisture detection in low salinity and low organic matter soils. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Monitoring of soil water content using spherical smart aggregates based on electromechanical impedance ({EMI}) technique
VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - Real-time monitoring of soil water content is of great significance to prevent many engineering accidents, such as landslide, water seepage of foundation dam, and reduction of foundation bearing capacity. Electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique based smart aggregates (SAs) have showed excellent monitoring capability in various engineering applications. However, there are limited reports on the application of EMI based SAs in the monitoring of the soil water content. In this paper, the EMI based spherical SAs (SSAs) were investigated in the monitoring of soil water content. Firstly, the SSAs were designed and fabricated using the monolithic concrete encapsulation method, and their stable performance in air were evaluated, and confirmed by testing and analyzing the impedance spectrum. Then, the fabricated SSAs were immersed in the water environment for 28 d to ensure the stability under the working conditions, such as the soil with high water content and the hydration process of early-age concrete. Secondly, the monitoring experiments of soil water content were carried out based on the SSAs and the traditional SAs using the EMI technique. The measured impedance signatures under different water contents in soil were quantified by three types of statistical indexes, including root mean square deviation, mean absolute percentage deviation, and correlation coefficient deviation. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional SAs, the SSAs are more sensitive and stable to monitor the soil water content. Finally, the effect of temperature on the performance of SSA based on the EMI technique were conducted experimentally. The results demonstrate that temperature has influence on the monitoring results of the SSAs based on the EMI technique. Â© 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Research on regional soil moisture dynamics based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology
VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to realize the dynamic analysis of regional soil moisture content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in Weihe River Basin, Weifang City, Shandong Province, a regional soil moisture dynamic analysis model based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology is proposed. The process of predicting and deducing the soil water content through the spectral information of remote sensing images, surface parameters and other data can reflect the soil spectral information. The band sensitive to the change of soil moisture in remote sensing image is directly extracted, which is used as the independent variable input in the soil water logging inversion model, and the process of soil moisture prediction is conducted with the measured soil moisture value as the dependent variable input. The SI-1, SI-2 and other water spectral indexes that can reflect the water information are constructed, and the water spectral index used for soil water content retrieval is constructed through various relationships between bands. Compared with the spectral reflectance alone, the use of water spectral index greatly improves the retrieval accuracy. The particle filter algorithm is used to assimilate the observed data and simulated data to obtain the assimilated soil moisture. Error evaluation indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained assimilation results and further use different particle numbers and observation errors to conduct multiple data assimilation experiments to explore the sensitivity of particle numbers and observation errors to the assimilation results. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to test and verify the effect of data assimilation. The test shows that the dynamic analysis of the regional soil moisture content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in the Fangwei River basin by using this method the distribution map obtained by dividing the vegetation coverage are more consistent with the actual situation in terms of the proportion of different soil water salinization degrees, the regional distribution of water, etc. The idea of using hyperspectral remote sensing to retrieve soil moisture is effective.

VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - In this review, we have evaluated several methods and recent technologies to determine the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) content to increase yield production. Sensing technology has been used for a long time to determine the exact amount of soil nutrients without going through a conventional time-consuming, and expensive laboratory testing process. Several types of sensors are developed to measure the quantity of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) present in the soil, basically known as NPK sensor that provides on-the-go detection. A significant need for compact, inexpensive, low-power, and rapid soil NPK sensors is anticipated due to the demand for enhanced agriculture production and the future widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT). This fact implies using advanced technologies for both sensing elements and rapid detection. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have also been utilized to optimize soil NPK levels. These techniques involve training models on large datasets of soil samples and their corresponding nutrient levels, allowing for accurate prediction of nutrient concentrations based on sensor data. Only the sensing devices primarily used in agriculture applications will be discussed in this review. The prominent technologies and methods used in agriculture will be explored with regard to research and development ever held in agricultural sensing devices for measuring soil parameters. These elementary methods of determining the soil parameters may be grouped into two classes: conventional and emerging. We expect this review to guide the researchers and provide an approach to the study related to producing a convenient, affordable, and efficient soil NPK detection sensor. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Characterizing soil water content variability across spatial scales from optimized high-resolution distributed temperature sensing technique
VL  - 612
SN  - NA
AB  - Fiber-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing, when combined with the Single-probe Heat-pulse technique can measure soil moisture (Î¸) across spatial scales. The key limitation of this system is in obtaining the relationship between soil thermal conductivity (Î») and Î¸ for a specific field. Using the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site, this study tested a new methodology to account for the spatial variability in the Î»-Î¸ relationship using a Gaussian processes model. The resulting accurate Î¸ measurements (RMSE = 0.03 m3mâˆ’3) were used to characterize the spatial variability of Î¸ across scales and to develop an empirical equation that can correct for the changes in the Î¸ spatial variability observed at different spatial resolutions. In addition, the number of required samples to accurately characterize Î¸ and its variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated. These findings provide key information to scale soil moisture from centimeters to hundreds of meters for process understanding. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fiber optic soil water content sensor for precision farming
VL  - 149
SN  - NA
AB  - In this work, we propose a novel and cost effective fiber optic platform for the continuous monitoring of soil water content to be exploited in the agri-food sector and, in particular, in the field of precision agriculture to promote the rational use of water resources. The proposed platform arises from the judicious connection of optical fiber technology and functional materials able to exhibit a change in their optical properties depending on the water content in the environment. Al2O3 disks have been used as functional materials, taking advantage of their capability to absorb water and exhibit a correlated absorbance increase in the wavelength range corresponding to the absorption peak of water. A detailed study has been carried out to obtain the best coupling conditions between optical fibers and the functional disk. The final prototype has been tested directly in soil and the collected results show its capability to detect soil water content variation in the range 0â€“35\% of volumetric water content (VWC) with a sensitivity of 2.3\%/\%VWC and a VWC resolution lower than 1\%. Such performances allow the proposed device to be used for soil water content measurements for applications in several fields and in different hydrogeological conditions, such as, e.g., in smart farming applications, to support farmers in defining a correct irrigation strategy, or for the real-time monitoring of hydrogeological hazard, to prevent rainfall-induced landslide. Moreover, thanks to the capability of optical fibers technology to multiplex different fiber probes while sharing the same interrogation equipment, the proposed platform is endowed with multiplexing capabilities and presents a solid basis for a continuous monitoring of soil moisture monitoring over large areas.

VL  - 2022
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient balance is affected by nutrient management in crops. A poor nutrient management technique results in an imbalance in the soil nutrient status which could have a long-term negative impact on crop production. The current study was carried out to assess the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on soil nutrient balance in a maize-wheat cropping system in Cambisols of Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The experiment included three-factor randomized complete block design with three doses of each N, P, and K which was replicated three times. There was a remarkable change in soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N, P, and K contents of soil over a period of time with the application of different doses of NPK. Soil pH changed from 5.98 to 5.53, SOC increased from 11.7 to 16.8 gÂ·kg-1, total N decreased from 1264 to 1177 mgÂ·kg-1, available P2O5 declined from 214 to 63.6 mgÂ·kg-1, and available K2O decreased from 71.7 to 24.8 mgÂ·kg-1 with varying rates of NPK after four cropping seasons. Furthermore, partial, apparent, and net N, P, K balance were predominantly negative in all the fertilizer treatments, but the magnitude was lower under higher nutrient rates and positive partial N balance was noticed in higher N levels. The depletion of native P and K pools even at higher application rates was attributed to higher crop removal over time as compared to inputs. Therefore, continuous application of balanced fertilizers is crucial in maintaining the fertility of soil and productivity of crops. Â© 2022 Nabin Rawal et al.

TI  - Monitoring of drying-induced soil moisture loss with {PZT}-based {EMI} technique
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - Air-drying process of soil is a crucial procedure in geological and geotechnical engineering. Drying-induced ground subsidence and damage to overlying buildings is a widespread and urgent problem. Monitoring of drying-induced water evaporation in soil is of great importance. In this paper, soil moisture loss monitoring based on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer using electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique was investigated. A physical model test in our laboratory was conducted to study the feasibility and applicability. In the experimental research, three identical PZT transducers that were wrapped with waterproof insulation glue were pre-embedded inside a cohesive soil specimen. In addition, another PZT transducer was embedded in a sandy soil specimen to explore the application effect in soil with different composition. EMI signatures of these four PZT patches during the air-drying process were collected and analyzed. Experimental results indicated that the peak frequency in the conductance signatures presented a rightward shift as the water evaporates. Moreover, the corresponding peak magnitude keep decreasing with the continuous development of soil moisture loss. To better quantify the variations, two statistical metrics including root mean square deviation (RMSD) and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) were employed to study the changing characteristics of the EMI signatures. All these two metrics increase coincidentally in the process. Experimental results demonstrate that cohesive and sandy soil moisture loss monitoring by using the embedded PZT transducer is feasible and reliable. This work also serves as a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the performance of the EMI technique in monitoring the soil moisture content. Â© The Author(s) 2022.

VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an âˆ¼9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (â‰¤10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.

AB  - There are many problems with agricultural technology around the world, such as extensive irrigation which causes the waste of water. To significantly improve the efficiency of irrigation water, an antenna sensor, with high sensitivity and wide range, is proposed to measure the soil water content (SWC) wirelessly. When the SWC changes, the resonant frequency of the antenna will shift. By reading the resonant frequency of the antenna sensor, the SWC can be measured and transmitted wirelessly. The antenna sensor has a wider detection range of SWC, ranging from 10\% to 44\%, and a novel metamaterial structure electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) is designed and its function in improving sensitivity is verified. Furthermore, by sputtering 60-nm-thick SiO2 film on the surface of the antenna patch, its sensitivity has also been greatly improved. When the SiO2 film is sputtered on the antenna sensor, its sensitivity is 7.2 MHz/\% and 7.6 MHz/\% when the SWC is 10\%-29\% and 30\%-44\%, respectively. In summary, this work contributes to methods and instruments for wireless measurement of the SWC. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 48
SN  - 0094-8276
AB  - Using optical remote sensing data to downscale microwave soil moisture is currently a crucial technique for producing fine-resolution soil moisture data set at large scales. Conventional soil moisture downscaling models are mainly developed and evaluated in arid or semi-arid regions, but have serious limitation in humid regions. To improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes, this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol under wet climate. Finally, soil moisture downscaling is conducted by applying such models (built at the 25-km scale) at a finer (1-km) resolution. Validation result of downscaled soil moisture against in situ data set demonstrates the advantage of the enhanced model.

TI  - Soil moisture sensing in saltwater: a review
VL  - 82
SN  - NA
AB  - The ability to accurately obtain soil moisture contents is important in many different fields, including agriculture and branches of civil engineering including hydraulics, transportation, and geotechnical engineering. The moisture content of pavement subgrade affects pavement performance. Long-term monitoring the moisture content of subgrade can allow for better pavement design and maintenance practices. Collecting soil samples for gravimetric testing is time consuming and destructive, which is not practical for long-term monitoring. Soil moisture sensors employing a variety of technologies have been developed for recording soil moisture contents non-destructively and remotely. Soils that are exposed to irrigation or sea waters can have varying amounts of salinity. Salinity in the soil can adversely affect the performance of various sensor technologies. This review paper summarizes the difficulties associated with the use of commonly used, commercially available soil moisture sensors using time domain reflectometry (TDR), capacitance, impedance, time domain transmission (TDT), and transmission line oscillator technology.

The sensor function was based on dielectric theory to monitor SM. Three linear calibration models were established using different soils. The sensor for each depth showed acceptable statistics of validations. The linear fit coefficient of determination (R2) ranged from 0.95 to 0.99. Root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 1.35 to 4.30. The sensor performed consistently for at least 4 months, and is suitable for continuous monitoring of in situ SM and irrigation scheduling.

TI  - Assessing the feasibility of a directional cosmic-ray neutron sensing sensor for estimating soil moisture
VL  - 11
SN  - 2193-0856
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a non-invasive tool for measuring hydrogen pools such as soil moisture, snow or vegetation. The intrinsic integration over a radial hectare-scale footprint is a clear advantage for averaging out small-scale heterogeneity, but on the other hand the data may become hard to interpret in complex terrain with patchy land use. This study presents a directional shielding approach to prevent neutrons from certain angles from being counted while counting neutrons entering the detector from other angles and explores its potential to gain a sharper horizontal view on the surrounding soil moisture distribution. Using the Monte Carlo code URANOS (Ultra Rapid Neutron-Only Simulation), we modelled the effect of additional polyethylene shields on the horizontal field of view and assessed its impact on the epithermal count rate, propagated uncertainties and aggregation time. The results demonstrate that directional CRNS measurements are strongly dominated by isotropic neutron transport, which dilutes the signal of the targeted direction especially from the far field. For typical count rates of customary CRNS stations, directional shielding of half-spaces could not lead to acceptable precision at a daily time resolution. However, the mere statistical distinction of two rates should be feasible.

VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - Actively heated optical fiber method (AHFO) based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature measurement technology has been continuously applied in soil moisture monitoring due to its advantages such as good durability, quasi-distribution, and small size. The FBG alumina ceramic tube sensor with symmetrical internal heating is used to design a laboratory model. By changing the inner capillary tube, a continuous function was used to fit the calibration relationship between the temperature rise and the volumetric water content, and the influence of different heating times on the calibration relationship was analyzed. Laboratory test studies have shown that the capillary tube with a low thermal conductivity material inside can help improve the sensor's ability to resolve volumetric water content. The calibration relationship under short-time heating also has a high correlation, and it can also reduce the impact on the soil environment. The research results are of great significance for improving the measurement accuracy of the AHFO method and the improvement of the test method. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Ground validation of remote sensing soil moisture requires ground measurements corresponding to the pixel scale. To date, there is still a lack of simple, fast and reasonable methods for soil moisture measurement at pixel scale between point measurements and remote sensing observations. In this study, a measurement method of soil moisture using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was proposed for pixel scale. We used a PulseEKKOTM PRO GPR system with 250 MHz antennas to measure soil moisture by Fixed Offset (FO) method in four 30 Ã— 30 m2 plots chosen from the desert steppe. This study used a random combination method to analyze soil moisture measurements acquired by different numbers of GPR survey lines. The results showed that two survey lines of GPR would be sufficient under confidence level of 90\% with the relative error of 7\%, and four survey lines of GPR would be eligible under confidence level of 95\% with the relative error of 5\% for each plot. GPR measurement can reproduce the spatial distribution of soil moisture with higher resolution and smaller error, especially when two and four survey lines are designed in cross shape and grid shape, respectively. The method was applied to ground validation for the soil moisture from Landsat 8, showing the advantages of stable relative errors, less contingency and reliable evaluation when compared to point measurements. This method is fast and convenient and not limited to a certain pixel, and thus largely benefits the scale matching of remote sensing results and field measurements in ground validation.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important land environment characteristic that connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology. Surface soil moisture (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production. Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis, random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of 0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional applications with a small sample size.

TI  - Analysis of metamaterial-inspired soil moisture microwave sensor
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - In this letter, the authors propose a microwave sensor capable to detect soil moisture content parameter for use in precision agriculture and agricultural smart monitoring applications. The novel sensor is based on complementary split-ring resonator metamaterial topology, microstrip line and was built under biodegradable dielectric substrate of polylactic acid for sustainable purposes. The sensing mechanism relates the sensor's resonant frequency to the soil moisture content changes over time. For experimental validation purposes, a compact sensor prototype (75 mm Ã— 35 mm Ã— 1.55 mm and 12 g) with fundamental resonant frequency at 958 MHz was built and submitted to calibration process on typically sandy and clay soils to get fitting models capable to estimate soil moisture content. Simulated and experimental results are presented together and show good agreement with each other. The calibration data for both soil types were processed using the least-squares method and the proposed curve-fitting models are capable to estimate soil moisture content levels from 5\% to 20\% for sandy soil and from 12\% to 23\% for clay soil with satisfactory accuracy, proving the device viability.

TI  - Soil {Moisture} {Monitoring} of the {Plant} {Root} {Zone} by {Using} {Phenology} as {Context} in {Remote} {Sensing
VL  - 13
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - In this study, the phenological behavior and energy balance of plants are used as a sensory mechanism for root-zone soil moisture monitoring using both in-situ and satellite remote sensing data. The commonly used in-situ measurements are not feasible for mapping soil moisture at large-scale agricultural areas. Local direct root-zone soil moisture measurements cannot be reliably interpolated owing to the high spatial variability of soil structure and the vegetative content. Remote sensing methods are negatively affected by vegetation coverage and density regarding penetration and backscattering characteristics. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a root-zone soil moisture estimation method utilizing a context-aware data clustering process, which can be applied prior to any statistical analysis, for empirical evaluation of data. In this aspect, the crops' phenological stages and soil-air temperature differences are defined as the two contexts for data clustering. Parameters such as canopy-air temperature difference, land surface temperature, and solar radiation with respect to plant energy and water processes are used for the analysis. The proposed model is utilized using piecewise linear regression of data obtained from 16 rainfed wheat parcels distributed across Turkey, under different climatic and topographic conditions. It is shown that the proposed context-aware data clustering process enables the nonlinear plant behavior to be analyzed linearly. The correlation value of the whole season increased from 21\% to a range between 78\% and 95\% for different clusters. The outliers became relevant and the parameters became significant after the proposed context-aware data clustering.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The understanding of land surface-atmosphere energy exchange is extremely important for predicting climate change and weather impacts, particularly the influence of soil moisture content (SMC) on hydrometeorological and ecological processes, which are also linked to human activities. Unfortunately, traditional measurement methods are expensive and cumbersome over large areas, whereas measurements from satellite active and passive microwave sensors have shown advantages for SMC monitoring. Since the launch of the first passive microwave satellite in 1978, more and more progresses have been made in monitoring SMC from satellites, e.g., the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions in the last decade. Recently, new methods using signals of opportunity have been emerging, highlighting the Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which has wide applications in Earth's surface remote sensing due to its numerous advantages (e.g., revisiting time, global coverage, low cost, all-weather measurements, and near real-time) when compared to the conventional observations. In this paper, a detailed review on the current SMC measurement techniques, retrieval approaches, products, and applications is presented, particularly the new and promising GNSS-R technique. Recent advances, future prospects and challenges are given and discussed.

TI  - The combined use of remote sensing and wireless sensor network to estimate soil moisture in golf course
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - In gardening, particularly in golf courses, soil moisture management is critical for maximizing water efficiency. Remote sensing has been used to estimate soil moisture in recent years with relatively low accuracies. In this paper, we aim to use remote sensing and wireless sensor networks to generate soil moisture indexes for a golf course. In the golf course, we identified three types of soil, and data was gathered for three months. Mathematical models were obtained using data from Sentinel-2, bands with a resolution of 10 and 20 m, and sensed soil moisture. Models with acceptable accuracy were obtained only for one out of three soil types, the natural soil in which natural vegetation is grown. Two multiple regression models are presented with an R2 of 0.46 for bands at 10 m and 0.70 for bands at 20 m. Their mean absolute error was lower than 3\% in both cases. For the modified soils, the greens, and the golf course fairway, it was not feasible to obtain regression models due to the temporal uniformity of the grass and the range of variation of soil moisture. The developed moisture indexes were compared with existing options. The attained accuracies improve the current models. The verification indicates that the model generated with band 4 and band 12 is the one with better accuracy. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Study on the mobile phs method for soil moisture monitoring based on thermal effect
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Moisture content is an important index that affects the physical and mechanical properties of geotechnical materials. Rapid and accurate monitoring of soil moisture distribution is of great significance for guiding engineering practice. At present, the heat source method for moisture monitoring requires high stability of heat source intensity. To reduce the requirement of heating power, a point heat source (PHS) method for soil moisture monitoring was proposed. This method uses the correlation between the thermal conductivity of soil and the moisture content, and indirectly identifies the moisture content by monitoring the cooling law of the PHS in soil, which can eliminate the influence of heat source intensity. Based on this idea, a mobile PHS system for soil moisture monitoring composed of a sensing-heating system and a monitoring tube was designed, which can solve the spatial resolution problem of fiber Bragg grating measurement system. Firstly, the system was used to carry out calibration tests on two different graded soil specimens with uniform moisture content. According to the cooling law of the heat source in porous medium, the discriminant index Î· of moisture content was defined, and then the relationship between the volumetric water content Î¸ and Î· was established. Then the tests were carried out in the soil specimens with non-uniform moisture content, and a calibration relation established by the calibration tests was used to invert Î¸. The results were compared with those measured by drying method, thus verifying the feasibility of the proposed method. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of significant importance for numerous Earth and environmental science applications that directly impact the global environment and human society. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable environmental development, and food security.

VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - Currently, near-surface soil moisture at a global scale is being provided using National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites, both of which utilize L-band (1.4 GHz; 21 cm wavelength) passive microwave remote sensing techniques. However, a fundamental limitation of this technology is that the water content can only be measured for approximately the top 5-cm layer of soil moisture, and only over low-to-moderate vegetation covered areas in order to meet the 0.04 textm3/textm3 target accuracy, limiting its applicability. Consequently, a longer wavelength radiometer is being explored as a potential solution for measuring soil moisture in a deeper surface layer of soil and under denser vegetation. It is expected that P-band (wavelength of 40 cm and frequency of 750 MHz) could potentially provide soil moisture information for the top sim 10 -cm layer of soil, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the wavelength. In addition, P-band is expected to have higher soil moisture retrieval accuracy due to its reduced sensitivity to vegetation water content and surface roughness. To demonstrate the potential of P-band passive microwave soil moisture remote sensing, a short-term airborne field experiment was conducted over a center pivot irrigated farm at Cressy in Tasmania, Australia, in January 2017. First results showing a comparison of airborne P-band brightness temperature observations against airborne L-band brightness temperature observations and ground soil moisture measurements are presented. The P-band brightness temperature was found to have a similar but stronger response to soil moisture compared to L-band. Â© 2004-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a pivotal hydrological variable that links the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. In this article, a new soil moisture (SM) index (SMI), which aims to capture the temporal variability of SM, irrespective of cloud cover and solar illumination, was developed by using the L-band SM active passive (SMAP) radiometer observations. The SMI was proposed on the basis of two key foundations: 1) vegetation and roughness have similar effects on "depolarization" of microwave emission, while SM enhances polarization differences and 2) vegetation and roughness generally impose positive effects on surface emissivity, while SM and emissivity are negatively correlated. Based on the two physical principles, it is possible to decouple the effects of SM and those of vegetation and surface roughness in a 2-D space independent of vegetation type and roughness condition. The proposed SMI was then validated by in situ measurements from five dense SM networks covering different vegetation and climatic conditions and also compared with SMAP passive and European space agency climate change initiative (ESA CCI) SM products at a coarse resolution of 36 km, and SMAP-enhanced passive and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR2) SM products at a medium resolution of 9 km. The results show that the new SMI is able to well reproduce the temporal dynamic of SM with a favorable averaged correlation coefficient value of 0.87 and 0.84 at 36 and 9 km, respectively, higher than that of SMAP passive (0.80), SMAP-enhanced passive (0.77), ESA CCI (0.69), and JAXA AMSR2 (0.53). After removing the systematic differences between satellite and site-specific SM data by using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique, the SMI can achieve an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.031 and 0.036 m3m-3 at 36 and 9 km during the validation period, respectively, lower than that of the satellite SM products. In addition to surface temperature, the SMI does not need any further information from other sensors [e.g., the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or leaf area index (LAI) data] to guarantee an all-weather monitoring. Therefore, it has great potential to estimate SM variability on a global scale. Â© 2019 IEEE.

VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Accuracy of capacitance moisture sensors is typically deteriorated on account of soil bulk electrical conductivity effect. In this work, a low-cost capacitance sensor with dual frequency excitation for soil water content measurement was proposed. Then, a two-step calibration method was presented to reduce soil bulk electrical conductivity effect on soil water content. Firstly, the mathematical model of output voltages U under dual frequency (f1 and f2) excitation and dielectric permittivity Ka was established with several solution samples. Secondly, the empirical calibration equation of dielectric permittivity Ka and soil volume water content theta was determined with soil samples. Finally, the two-step calibration method was evaluated compared with empirical equations. Four different soil water content (25\%, 31\%, 36\%, and 41\%) samples were prepared with electrical conductivities in range of 0- 1100 mu textS /cm. The results showed that the mathematical model of theta - Ka has a better linearity which determination coefficient R2 was 0.994, the maximum measurement error was 0.012 textm3cdot textm-3 , and the maximum electrical conductivity variation was 0.029 when the soil water content was 41\%. In a word, the two-step calibration method is effective on reducing soil bulk electrical conductivity effect on soil water content measurement and improving its accuracy. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 23
SN  - 1606-9749
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14\%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39\% and rESA-CC I(2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014)=2.23\%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014)=2.59\%).

VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - The measurement of soil water content is a very important factor in plant cultivation, both from an economic and ecological point of view. Proper estimation of moisture content not only allows for proper yields but can also contribute to ecologically appropriate use of fresh water, of which the worldâ€™s resources are limited. It is important, for example, that the moisture content in the root area of plants is optimal for their growth, while over-watering can result in losses in the form of water, which seeps below the root layer and is lost. The novel, inexpensive electronic meter for measuring soil moisture is presented in the article. The meter, based on a capacitive method, uses an optimization algorithm to calculate soil electrical permeability and a simplified new formula between soil electrical permeability and volumetric moisture content. Moreover, by using two high-frequency signals for measurements, it is possible not only to estimate moisture content but also soil conductivity. Both readings obtained from the meter not only allow for rational management of crop optimization for economic reasons but are also important for environmental protection. In addition, the inexpensive meter, based on the principle of operation presented, can be made as an IoT module, which allows for its wide application. Â© 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Soil water content monitoring using joint application of {PDI} and {TVDI} drought indices
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing technology provides a viable way for large-scale soil water content (SWC) estimation. The perpendicular drought index (PDI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are two drought indices that can reflect SWC based on remote sensing data. These two indices have their own set of pros and cons when used independently for SWC estimation: PDI is primarily suitable for low vegetation coverage, whereas TVDI is more suitable for dense vegetation coverage. Thus, it might be inappropriate to employ a single model for the entire growth cycle. In this study, the relationship between PDI/TVDI and SWC at soil depths of 0â€“20 cm, 0â€“30 cm and 0â€“40 cm was analysed. We found that the estimation accuracy of the PDI/TVDI model was markedly affected by soil depth and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Two combination approaches (joint and combined models) based on PDI and TVDI indices were established. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the joint/combined models were 1.49\%/1.48\% at 0â€“20 cm, 1.46\%/1.48\% at 0â€“30 cm and 1.86\%/1.90\% at 0â€“40 cm. Our results show that both combination models are suitable for regional SWC estimation. Â© 2020, Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.

TI  - An {Improved} {Method} for {Soil} {Moisture} {Monitoring} {With} {Ensemble} {Learning} {Methods} {Over} the {Tibetan} {Plateau
VL  - 14
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key parameter of the hydrological process, which affects exchanges of water and heat at the land/atmosphere interface. The â€œtrapezoidâ€ (or â€œtriangleâ€) method has been widely applied to SM monitoring based on the pixel distribution within the thermal and optical remote sensing observations. However, the trapezoid method is a linear empirical model highly related to the retrieval accuracy of the surface temperature. In the article, the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to retrieve SM through an improved method over the Tibetan Plateau. The improved method is integrated with the â€œtrapezoidâ€ model and multiple learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Meanwhile, RF and XGBoost were both trained with SM target data (the scale of SM and soil temperature) derived from the Tibetan Plateau observations, and the input variables were derived from MODIS observations. Compared with the SM measured, the results showed the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the correlation coefficient of the ensemble retrievals were 0.046-0.081 m3m-3, 0.030-0.065 m3m-3, and 0.60-0.87, respectively, which is better than that of the separate model. The ideas to implement the combination of traditional inversion algorithms and machine learning methods are helpful for researches in remote sensing fields.

TI  - A spatial downscaling method for {SMAP} soil moisture through visible and shortwave-infrared remote sensing data
VL  - 590
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an indispensable role in many practical applications, such as drought monitoring, hydrologic applications and agricultural management. Passive microwave remote sensing has proven capable of capturing changes in SM. However, the coarse spatial resolution (approximately 25â€“40 km) may greatly limit many regional hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study, we present a SM downscaling method based on the visible and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) remote sensing data toward improved spatial resolution of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM. In the proposed method, the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), horizontally polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh), vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBv) and SWIR reflectance collected in Inner Mongolia from April to September 2018 and April to September 2019 are used as input data and combined with topographic information to downscale the SMAP SM L3 product from the original 36 km to 1 km. Random forest (RF) was used to link the input data and SMAP SM. Finally, 30 in situ station SM measurements distributed in Inner Mongolia and precipitation data were used to verify the downscaled SM. The results show that the correlation range of the downscaled SM and the in situ SM is 0.246 to 0.739, with an average of 0.535. The root mean square error (RMSE) range is 0.02 to 0.152 m3/m3, and the mean RMSE is 0.059 m3/m3. The ubRMSE has a range of 0.02 to 0.06 m3/m3, and the mean performance is 0.04 m3/m3. The bias ranges from âˆ’0.145 to 0.087 m3/m3, and the mean bias is 0.008 m3/m3. The downscaled SMAP SM can capture the spatial heterogeneity of the SMAP SM and the dynamic changes in measured soil moisture. The downscaled SMAP SM also has a high spatial correspondence with the original SMAP SM, providing more detailed soil water information than the original 36 km resolution. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil moisture and density monitoring methodology using {TDR} measurements
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content (MC) and density of pavement materials exert a great influence on pavement performance. Cyclic traffic loading with increasing MC in materials can accelerate changes in density significantly. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a non-destructive method for measuring MC and density of soil. In this study, TDR measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road material at two different conditions; at constant MC with different density and at constant dry density with different MC. Based on TDR measurements, a theoretical formulation between voltage drop occurring for the passage of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the electrical conductivity (EC) is developed. This relationship is further correlated to develop density function providing the opportunity to obtain MC information. For the validation of the calibration functions, sensors are installed in roads to obtain field data. Laboratory results point out that the calibration models are independent of moisture and density, and the field instrumentation shows the satisfactory accuracy of the method. The newly established calibration models allow for observing the routine performance providing a better understanding of the material behaviour for example rutting of roads.

TI  - Review of {GNSS}-{R} {Technology} for {Soil} {Moisture} {Inversion
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter in water cycle research. Rapid and accurate monitoring of SM is critical for hydrological and agricultural applications, such as flood detection and drought characterization. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) uses L-band microwave signals as carriers, which are particularly sensitive to SM and suitable for monitoring it. In recent years, with the development of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technology and data analysis methods, many studies have been conducted on GNSS-R SM monitoring, which has further enriched the research content. However, current GNSS-R SM inversion methods mainly rely on auxiliary data to reduce the impact of non-target parameters on the accuracy of inversion results, which limits the practical application and widespread promotion of GNSS-R SM monitoring. In order to promote further development in GNSS-R SM inversion research, this paper aims to comprehensively review the current status and principles of GNSS-R SM inversion methods. It also aims to identify the problems and future research directions of existing research, providing a reference for researchers. Firstly, it introduces the characteristics, usage scenarios, and research status of different GNSS-R SM observation platforms. Then, it explains the mechanisms and modeling methods of various GNSS-R SM inversion research methods. Finally, it highlights the shortcomings of existing research and proposes future research directions, including the introduction of transfer learning (TL), construction of small models based on spatiotemporal analysis and spatial feature fusion, and further promoting downscaling research.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a significant role in the global hydrological cycle, which is an important component of soil parameterization. Remote sensing is one of the most important methods used to estimate soil moisture. In this study, we developed a new nonlinear Erf-BP neural network method to establish a soil-moisture-content-estimation model with integrated multiple-resource remote-sensing data from high-resolution, hyperspectral and microwave sensors. Next, we compared the result with the single-resource remote-sensing data for SMC (soil-moisture content) estimation models by using the linear-fitting method. The results showed that the soil-moisture estimation model offers better accuracy by using multiple-resource remote-sensing data. Furthermore, the SMC predicted the results by using the new Erf-BP neural network with multiple-resource remote-sensing data and a good overall correlation coefficient of 0.6838. Compared with the linear model's estimation results, the accuracy of the SMC estimation using the Erf-BP method was increased, and the RMSE decreased from 0.017 g/g to 0.0146 g/g, a decrease of 16.44\%. These results also indicate that the improved algorithm of the Erf-BP artificial neural network has better fitting results and precision. This research provides a reference for multiple-resource remote-sensing data for soil-moisture estimation.

VL  - 52
SN  - 0255-660X
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the least monitored of all the hydrologic variables. It is greatly influenced by unpredictable and intermittent precipitation, varying evapotranspiration rates, heterogeneous soils, land cover, topography, and is extremely changeable in both space and time. The aim of this study is to retrieve surface and rootzone soil moisture in fallow land at a field scale using Sentinel-1A SAR data. The study explores the potential of obtaining surface soil moisture over fallow land at two different soil types from C-band SAR data. The study area consists of two plots having different soil types. The study area was divided into 80 grids, each measuring 10 x 10 m, to collect soil samples which are synchronized with Sentinel-1A passes. The soil moisture which are retrieved from plot 1 were used to develop the model. The developed model was validated in plot 2. In order to study the impact of soil moisture and dielectric constant on backscattering coefficients, a multiple regression analysis was used to create a semi-empirical model. Rootzone soil moisture retrieval model was developed by considering the backscattered coefficient, volumetric surface soil moisture as an independent variable and volumetric rootzone soil moisture as dependent variable. The predicted surface soil moisture using the regression model were identical to in-situ observed surface soil moisture, with R2 of 0.77, RMSE of 1.31 m3/m3, and NSE of 0.75. The estimated rootzone soil moisture matches the in-situ observed rootzone soil moisture identically with R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.23 m3/m3, NSE = 0.73. This study aids local farmers in their irrigation water management.

TI  - Remote sensing and soil moisture data for water productivity determination
VL  - 263
SN  - NA
AB  - This work was initiated in 2019 within the FAO WEPS project framework (2018â€“2022), aiming to determine the Water Productivity (WP) of the Tunisian olive orchards combining two scales of measurements for soil moisture determination: one for the global analysis (remote sensing) and the other for the field scale application. The experiment was made in 2019 and 2020 in the Centre of Tunisia (Kairouan city, locality of Elhouereb), which is one of the largest irrigation area of Tunisia. WP was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) which was determined following the water balance method as: ETa=R+Iâ€“Î”S, where Î”S is the amount of water stored in the soil (0â€“60 cm) and (R) and (I) are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume, respectively. The annual ETa reached 293 mm for the rainfed orchard, 823 mm for the semi-intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm for the intensive fertigated orchard. The WP defined as being the ratio of Yield (kg olives/tree)/ETa ranged between 0.29 kg/m3 (rainfed) and 0.77 kg/m3 (fertigated) depending on the cultivation system. Soil moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter coefficient (r = âˆ’0.34 for the rainfed and 0.91 for the irrigated orchards) which was determined from the radar images which were treated by using different applications (SNAP, ODK, QGIS.), This result shows the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application. To conclude: WP is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed grove; this indicates a great potential of WP improvement if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad (pruning, irrigation); so that, the WP can be used as a decision-making-tool for farmers and makers in the future.

TI  - A field-portable acoustic sensing device to measure soil moisture
VL  - 174
SN  - NA
AB  - For the last couple of decades, the idea of soil water measurement has gained widespread importance due to the spiraling crisis of global water resources. While several methods are being commonly used for soil water measurement, most of them do not satisfy all the essential requirements for water monitoring under field conditions including rapid on-site measurement and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a novel field-portable acoustic sensing device on soil moisture measurements. The conventional Brutsaert's model was followed involving the continuous wave zero-crossing method to measure the acoustic velocity and considering the phase shift due to the amplifier and ambient temperature. The gravimetric moisture content (GMC) was calibrated using the acoustic velocity for 70 samples representing seven textural classes and variable soil organic carbon (OC). Results indicated the monotonous reduction of the acoustic velocities of p-wave with increasing GMC. In general, soils with higher clay content reflected higher acoustic velocities. However, sandy soils with high OC content were less prone to compaction and produced comparatively higher acoustic velocities than soils with higher clay content. A linear mixed effect (LME) model indicated that one unit increase in the acoustic velocity resulted in a 0.086\% decrease in GMC. Moreover, LME parameters-based K-means clustering further highlighted the influence of soil texture for controlling the acoustic velocity. The use of LME justified the use of GMC as the target instead of the degree of saturation. Linear and quadratic models fitted for individual LME-based clusters produced R2 values ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 and 0.82â€“0.88, respectively. Moreover, combined linear (R2 = 0.61; RMSE = 52.12 m/s) and quadratic (R2 = 0.64; RMSE = 50.48 m/s) models incorporating all 70 samples via bootstrapping produced comparable accuracies for GMC prediction, but yielded inferior results than the individual cluster-based models. In conclusion, the acoustic sensing device showed its potential for soil water content monitoring, leading to efficient irrigation planning. More research is warranted for texture-wise calibration development incorporating a wide assortment of soil types and on-site evaluation. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Three tags embedding different sensing systems compliant with the energy harvesting requirements were developed. The used sensors were previously characterized with the aim of tailoring an adequate electronic front-end. All the typical solutions for soil moisture detection were implemented: a fringe capacitance sensor, a soil impedance sensor, and finally a humidity sensor based on functionalization with TiO2 nano particles. The obtained results prove that the conceived solution is satisfactory and that the sensors have good sensing properties.

VL  - 167
SN  - NA
AB  - Globally, farmers are seeking advanced precision technology to help transform their practices into a more sustainable and productive agri-tech process. Accurate and real-time soil data has become one of the most valuable resources among farmers. Real-time soil sensor data can be exploited in manners that increase farm production and profit, maintain and increase product quality, promote food security, and ensure environmental protection. Researchers have already attempted to develop real-time in situ soil nutrient sensors based on optical and electrochemical techniques. Of these sensor systems, only a few of them are commercially available for monitoring. In this review, we present both available sensors and sensors under research in agriculture. Then briefly discuss both advantages and challenges to overcome in order to produce systems that deliver real-time quality soil information. Optical and electrochemical sensors are becoming less expensive to manufacture and can provide results that are comparable to laboratory soil analysis. Based on the literature presented here, there still exists a need to understand the effects of soil heterogeneity on the analytical performance of both electrochemical and optical systems when used in situ. By doing so, these sensors can be fully adopted as suitable commercial platforms. Overall, these sensors harness the potential to revolutionize decision management systems in agriculture as internet of things (IoT) soil nutrient sensors. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Measurement of soil water content using ground-penetrating radar: a review of current methods
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content (SWC) is a crucial parameter in ecology, agriculture, hydrology, and engineering studies. Research on non-invasive monitoring of SWC has been a long-lasting topic in these fields. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), a non-destructive geophysical technique, has the advantages of high resolution, deep detection depth, and high efficiency in SWC measurements at medium scale. It has been successfully applied in field investigations. This paper summarizes the recent progress in developing GPR-based SWC measurement methods, including reflected wave, ground wave, surface reflection, borehole GPR, full waveform inversion, average envelope amplitude, and frequency shift methods. The principles, advantages, limitations, and applications of these methods are described in detail. A comprehensive technical framework, which comprises the seven methods, is proposed to understand their principles and applicability. Two key procedures, namely, data acquisition and data processing, are emphasized as crucial to method applications. The suitable methods that will satisfy diverse application demands and field conditions are recommended. Future development, potential applications, and advances in hardware and data processing techniques are also highlighted. Â© 2017, Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.

TI  - Uniplanar multirod {TDR} probe for soil water content measurement over a larger spatial scale
VL  - 73
SN  - 1531-0353
AB  - This study developed a uniplanar multirod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and evaluated it in laboratory experiments for soil water measurement over a larger spatial scale. The sampling volume of the probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes. Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5-6 cm on both sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data. Cette etude a mis au point une sonde TDR uniplanaire a plusieurs tiges et l'a evaluee lors d'experiences en laboratoire pour mesurer l'eau du sol sur une plus grande echelle spatiale. Le volume d'echantillonnage de la sonde a ete determine en simulant la distribution du potentiel electrique autour des tiges de la sonde a l'aide du progiciel HYDRUS 2D et verifie par rapport a la constante dielectrique mesuree dans le sable sature. Les performances de la sonde ont ete evaluees en comparant ses mesures dielectriques dans le sable humide sur une large gamme de teneurs en eau pendant le sechage par evaporation avec celles mesurees par les sondes CS640. En outre, on a evalue la dependance de la reflexion de la lumiere visible sur la teneur en eau du sable. Les resultats ont montre que l'epaisseur effective moyenne du volume d'echantillonnage de la sonde etait de 5 a 6 cm de part et d'autre du plan des barres de sonde. La sonde a mesure avec precision la teneur en eau du sol sur une surface spatiale de 0,88 m2. La reflectance de la lumiere visible de la surface de sable saturee de facon variable et la teneur en eau correspondante du sable suivent une relation de type fonction de retention de l'eau-du sol. L'utilisation du systeme de TDR a plusieurs tiges a une plus grande echelle spatiale a des implications pratiques, notamment en ce qui concerne l'augmentation de la precision des donnees de teledetection.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic ray neutron probes (CRNPs) provide continuous monitoring of average near-surface soil water content (SWC) on hectometer scales. However, the performance of CRNPs on surfaces of highly heterogeneous vegetation and SWC remains uncertain. This study evaluated three vegetation calibration methods with the correction of vegetation distribution developed for a CRNP on the Loess Plateau of China. Three plots with different vegetation distributions were selected and equipped with CRNPs and SWC sensors, and their biomass as well as distribution were measured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a RedEdge multispectral camera. We found that the parameter N0, which is neutron flux in dry soil, was best represented by the biomass at average growth conditions of the monitoring period, yielding the lowest RMSE (0.068). The Vegâ€“N0 vegetation calibration method reduced the RMSE the most between the CRNP SWC and the Kriging-weighted SWC, and the correction of the spatial distribution of the vegetation further reduced the RMSE. The cooperation between the CRNP and the UAV could obtain the regional averaged SWC accurately. This study makes up for the lack of vegetation calibration for the CRNP on the Loess Plateau, which should help develop sustainable vegetation management and ecohydrological management strategies on the Loess Plateau, so as to protect water security in the region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of surface soil moisture using optical remote sensing data: a case study in a semi-arid area
VL  - 65
SN  - 1449-8596
AB  - Surface soil moisture content (SSMC) monitoring constitutes an important parameter to estimate crop water requirements, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Remote sensing became a useful tool for estimating SSMC. Two approaches were applied for monitoring the SSMC during the 2013/14 cropping season in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla (Morocco) using multispectral bands of Landsat-8 OLI images. The first approach examined the potential of visible and short-wave infrared drought index (VSDI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) and short-wave infrared water stress index (SIWSI), to retrieve SSMC. The second approach attempted to develop a new SSMC model based on evaluation of the correlations between multispectral bands and measured SSMC using a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results showed that the established model is highly correlated with the measured SSMC at all crop growth stages withR(2)of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.89, for bare soil, partially covered and entirely covered by vegetation, respectively.

TI  - An {Improved} {UAV}-{Based} {ATI} {Method} {Incorporating} {Solar} {Radiation} for {Farm}-{Scale} {Bare} {Soil} {Moisture} {Measurement
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of UAV-based remote sensing for soil moisture has developed rapidly in recent decades, with advantages such as high spatial resolution, flexible work arrangement, and ease of operation. In bare and low-vegetation-covered soils, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) method, which adopts thermal infrared data from UAV-based remote sensing, has been widely used for soil moisture estimation at the field scale. However, the ATI method may not perform well under inconsistent weather conditions due to inconsistency of the intensity of the soil surface energy input. In this study, an improvement of the ATI method (ATI-R), considering the variation in soil surface energy input, was developed by the incorporation of solar radiation measurements. The performances of the two methods were compared using field experiment data during multiple heating processes under various weather conditions. It showed that on consistently sunny days, both ATI-R and ATI methods obtained good correlations with the volumetric water contents (VWC) (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.775, RMSEATI-R = 0.023 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.778, RMSEATI = 0.018 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)) on cloudy or a combination of sunny and cloudy days as long as there were significant soil-heating processes despite the different energy input intensities; the ATI-R method could perform better than the ATI method (cloudy: R-ATI-R(2) = 0.565, RMSEATI-R = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.156, RMSEATI = 0.033 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3); combined: R-ATI-R(2) = 0.673, RMSEATI-R = 0.028 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.310, RMSEATI = 0.032 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)); and on overcast days, both the ATI-R and ATI methods could not perform satisfactorily (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI-R = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI = 0.031 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)). The results indicate that supplemental solar radiation data could effectively expand applications of the ATI method, especially for inconsistent weather conditions.

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Underground soil sensing for fertility monitoring is an emerging paradigm to facilitate quantitative and qualitative improvement in the food production. Moreover, soil fertility monitoring is needed in order to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. Underground soil sensing thus uses numerous types of sensors and devices that can help in the real-time monitoring of soil fertility. These sensory devices incorporate various communication protocols for relaying the sensory data. This provides motivation to present a review of existing underground sensing technologies with Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) that were used in agriculture for monitoring soil fertility. The presented taxonomy covers wide aspects of the state-of-the-art methodologies. Additionally, the challenges presented by IoUT in its design and implementation for monitoring soil fertility are considered and examined. Â© 1981-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring {Soil} {Moisture} {Drought} over {Northern} {High} {Latitudes} from {Space
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Mapping drought from space using, e.g., surface soil moisture (SSM), has become viable in the last decade. However, state of the art SSM retrieval products suffer from very poor coverage over northern latitudes. In this study, we propose an innovative drought indicator with a wider spatial and temporal coverage than that obtained from satellite SSM retrievals. We evaluate passive microwave brightness temperature observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite as a surrogate drought metric, and introduce a Standardized Brightness Temperature Index (STBI). We compute the STBI by fitting a Gaussian distribution using monthly brightness temperature data from SMOS; the normal assumption is tested using the Shapior-Wilk test. Our results indicate that the assumption of normally distributed brightness temperature data is valid at the 0.05 significance level. The STBI is validated against drought indices from a land surface data assimilation system (LDAS-Monde), two satellite derived SSM indices, one from SMOS and one from the ESA CCI soil moisture project and a standardized precipitation index based on in situ data from the European Climate Assessment \& Dataset (ECA\&D) project. When comparing the temporal dynamics of the STBI to the LDAS-Monde drought index we find that it has equal correlation skill to that of the ESA CCI soil moisture product (0.71). However, in addition the STBI provides improved spatial coverage because no masking has been applied over regions with dense boreal forest. Finally, we evaluate the STBI in a case study of the 2018 Nordic drought. The STBI is found to provide improved spatial and temporal coverage when compared to the drought index created from satellite derived SSM over the Nordic region. Our results indicate that when compared to drought indices from precipitation data and a land data assimilation system, the STBI is qualitatively able to capture the 2018 drought onset, severity and spatial extent. We did see that the STBI was unable to detect the 2018 drought recovery for some areas in the Nordic countries. This false drought detection is likely linked to the recovery of vegetation after the drought, which causes an increase in the passive microwave brightness temperature, hence the STBI shows a dry anomaly instead of normal conditions, as seen for the other drought indices. We argue that the STBI could provide additional information for drought monitoring in regions where the SSM retrieval problem is not well defined. However, it then needs to be accompanied by a vegetation index to account for the recovery of the vegetation which could cause false drought detection.

VL  - 11
SN  - 2391-5447
AB  - To understand the influence of underground mining disturbances on the shallow soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, remote sensing monitoring of the temporal and spatial evolution of surface soil moisture and the influence of mining on multi-source, multi-temporal and high spatial resolution remote sensing data were carried out. The scale effect of monitoring the soil moisture at different scales was analyzed using the Scaled Soil Moisture Monitor Index (S-SMMI). In this paper, SPOT 5/6 and Worldview-2 were used as the data source and mainly made up two aspects of the research: 1) based on the three SPOT data sets with the use of S-SMMI from different angles from the Daliuta mine from nearly three years of soil moisture temporal and spatial changes, the results show that the perturbation has a negative effect on the shallow soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, and average soil moisture of the mining area is smaller than the nonmining area, but the surface ecological construction has effectively improved the impact of the underground mining disturbance on the surface soil moisture. 2) the scale conversion of Worldview-2 data was carried out based on the resampling method. S-SMMI was used to analyze the scale effect of soil moisture monitoring at different scales. The results show that the difference between the soil moisture is only 0.0016 during the conversion process of 2 m-30 m.

VL  - 16
SN  - 1748-0221
AB  - Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) is a powerful technique that allows non-invasive monitoring of soil moisture on length scales well matched for agricultural applications. One factor limiting the use of the technique within industrial agriculture settings is the high initial cost of Helium-3 or BF3 tubes typically used for ground level neutron monitoring. This paper discusses the use of Geant4 to design and optimise an alternative scintillator based epi-thermal neutron detector that may be applicable for challenges where cost is a higher driving factor than temporal resolution.

VL  - 372
SN  - NA
AB  - In this work, we explored hierarchical MoS2 nanomaterials for soil moisture sensing (SMS) and tested their efficacy considering the operational aspects of the sensor. Carnation and marigold flower-like MoS2 nanostructures were prepared via facile hydrothermal processes with varying synthesis temperatures. The synthesized MoS2 nanostructures were well characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, and HRTEM and it is evident that the variation in the hydrothermal temperatures has a significant impact on the crystallinity, morphology, stoichiometry, dimensions, and lattice spacing. We found that hierarchical MoS2 marigold flower-like nanostructures offer the highest sensitivity of about 2000 \%, when gravimetric water content (GWC) is varied from 1 \% to 20 \% GWC, which is one of the highest reported SMS. The sensors exhibit hysteresis of about Â± 4 \% and response times of about 500 s. They were highly selective to moisture compared to the other salts like Na, K, Cd, and Cu present in the soil. The sensors were also unaffected by changing temperatures with a small 2â€“4 \% between 20 Â°C and 65 Â°C. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Machine learning to estimate surface soil moisture from remote sensing data
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an integral quantity parameter in hydrology and agriculture practices. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions. Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study, an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision agriculture applications.

AB  - Determination of actual evapotranspiration is an important step for simulating the crop growth models in agricultural decision-making process. In this study, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) values for the main crops cultivated in Shahrekord plain, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran, are estimated based on real-time modeling and compared with the results obtained from the remote sensing data. Soil moisture balance was simulated considering the variation rate of crop canopy cover and its effects on evaporation and transpiration parameters. Daily values of ETa were predicted in a repeatable cycle based on the available soil moisture in root zone. Moreover, remote sensing images were analyzed as a data source to achieve the crop water requirement in critical times. For this objective, surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was used to characterize the evapotranspiration and then derived ETa. Preliminary results obtained by applying satellite information showed a good agreement between the SEBAL estimates of evapotranspiration fluxes and the corresponding values simulated by the soil moisture estimation technique.

VL  - 15
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Precision agriculture is experiencing substantial development through the improved availability of cost-effective instruments for data collection. This includes ground-based proximal sensing technologies that are able to compete with satellite and aircraft observation systems, due to low operational costs, high operational flexibility, and high spatial resolution. This article was therefore designed to compare the performance of multiple sensing systems mounted on a smart buggy platform. A number of proximal sensing technologies were then evaluated and intercompared for their accuracy in retrieving high resolution near-surface soil moisture. The sensors tested included an L-band microwave radiometer (ELBARA III), a global navigation satellite system reflectometer sensor (LARGO), and an electromagnetic induction sensor (EM38). Data were collected during the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) in Yanco, NSW, Australia, in September 2015. Observations from each sensor were converted to surface soil moisture values which were in turn evaluated against reference measurements obtained by in situ soil moisture measurements. The sensing technologies tested here have been individually assessed by many other studies, but within different regions and environments including surface condition, local weather, observing height, size of footprint, etc. Consequently, this article has used a single platform to intercompare the different sensors to be evaluated concurrently. Results from this article indicated that the L-band microwave radiometer achieved the best performance in retrieving surface soil moisture. The average RMSE and R were found to be 0.055 cm3/cm3 and 0.68 for ELBARA III, 0.084 cm3/cm3 and 0.51 for LARGO, and 0.090 cm3/cm3 and 0.32 for the EM38.

TI  - A novel spectroscopy-based method using monopole antenna for measuring soil water content
VL  - 168
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content measurement is indispensable to precision agriculture. A novel soil water content measuring method based on frequency scanning is proposed in this research. The measuring system consists of a monopole antenna to emit and receive electromagnetic waves as well as a network analyzer. The soil equivalent circuit model is presented and its spectroscopy is obtained by comparing incident and reflected waves. The results indicate that the resonance frequency shifts towards the low frequency region as soil moisture increases, therefore soil water content can be obtained simply by detecting resonance frequency. The linear fitting curve has a determination coefficient of 0.9834 and a root mean square error of 1.4\%. The measuring range from 5.0\% to 37.4\% is wide enough for actual agricultural production. The method offers a productive solution for soil water content measurement and provides an idea to sense other soil characteristics. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Remote sensing of vegetation and soil moisture content in {Atlantic} humid mountains with {Sentinel}-1 and 2 satellite sensor data
VL  - 163
SN  - NA
AB  - The satellite monitoring of vegetation moisture content (VMC) and soil moisture content (SMC) in Southern European Atlantic mountains remains poorly understood but is a fundamental tool to better manage landscape moisture dynamics under climate change. In the Atlantic humid mountains of Portugal, we investigated an empirical model incorporating satellite (Sentinel-1 radar, S1; Sentinel-2 optical, S2) and ancillary predictors (topography and vegetation cover type) to monitor VMC (\%) and SMC (\%). Predictors derived from the S1 (VV, HH and VV/HH) and S2 (NDVI and NDMI) are compared to field measurements of VMC (n = 48) and SMC (n = 48) obtained during the early, mid and end of summer. Linear regression modelling was applied to uncover the feasibility of a landscape model for VMC and SMC, the role of vegetation type models (i.e. native forest, grasslands and shrubland) to enhance predictive capacity and the seasonal variation in the relationships between satellite predictors and VMC and SMC. Results revealed a significant but weak relationship between VMC and predictors at landscape level (R2 = 0.30, RMSEcv = 69.9 \%) with S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type being the only significant predictors. The relationship improves in vegetation type models for grasslands (R2 = 0.35, RMSEcv = 95.0 \% with S2\_NDVI) and shrublands conditions (R2 = 0.52, RMSEcv = 45.3 \%). A model incorporating S2\_NDVI and S1\_VV explained 52 \% of the variation in VMC in shrublands. The relationship between SMC and satellite predictors at the landscape level was also weak, with only the S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type exhibiting a significant relationship (R2 = 0.28, RMSEcv = 18.9 \%). Vegetation type models found significant associations with SMC only in shrublands (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 9.03 \%) based on the S2\_NDMI and S1\_VV/VH ratio. The seasonal analysis revealed however that predictors associated to VMC and SMC may vary over the summer. The relationships with VMC were stronger in the early summer (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 90.1 \%; based on S2\_NDMI) and mid (R2 = 0.37, RMSEcv = 70.8 \%; based on S2\_NDVI), butnon-significant in the end of summer. Similar pattern was found for SMC, where the link with predictors decreases from the early summer (R2 = 0.33, RMSEcv = 16.0 \%; based on S1\_VH) and mid summer (R2 = 0.30, RMSEcv = 17.8 \%; based on S2\_NDMI) to the end of summer (non-significant). Overall, the hypothesis of a universal landscape model for VMC and SMC was not fully supported. Vegetation type models showed promise, particularly for VMC in shrubland conditions. Sentinel optical and radar data were the most significant predictors in all models, despite the inclusion of ancillary predictors. S2\_NDVI, S2\_NDMI, S1\_VV and S1\_VV/VH ratio were the most relevant predictors for VMC and, to a lesser extent, SMC. Future research should quantify misregistration effects using plot vs. moving window values for the satellite predictors, consider meteorological control factors, and enhance sampling to overcome a main limitation of our study, small sample size.

TI  - Temperature dependence of dielectric soil moisture measurement in an {Internet} of {Things} system â€“ a case study
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - A b s t r a c t. Soil moisture is a key parameter in determining crop growth and yield. Modern agriculture does not only take into account soil moisture measurements obtained once at selected points in the field, but also focuses on moisture monitoring. Knowledge of the variability over time and analysis of the variation in readings caused by heavy rainfall or strong sunshine and high soil temperature changes is very important for future model-ling, prediction and automated irrigation. The aim of this paper is to present a developed soil moisture monitoring system for a soil profile up to 34 cm depth incorporating Internet of Things technologies. The system was built based on an eight-channel time domain reflectometer to measure soil moisture based on dielectric properties. The developed system integrates both dielectric moisture measurement and innovative web-based server and visualisation services. The autonomous station was equipped with a long-range wireless communication and a solar-charged battery. Analysis of the results enabled us to observe the subtle deviations of moisture content of the upper soil layer during diurnal cycles. The designed station can be used in the future to integrate a high accuracy automatic field irrigation system and acquire data for precision agriculture. Â© 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter of the climate system as it relates to plant transpiration and photosynthesis and impacts landâ€“atmosphere interactions. Recent developments have seen an increasing number of electromagnetic sensors available commercially (EM) for soil volumetric water content (Î¸). Their use is constantly expanding, and they are becoming increasingly used for agricultural, ecological, and geotechnical applications and climate research, providing decision support and high-resolution data for models and machine-learning algorithms. In this study, a soil moisture sensor network consisting of 10 Sense Cap capacitance-based sensors is evaluated. Analytical performance of the sensors was determined based on laboratory and field measurements with dielectric permittivity (Îµ) standards and soil media substrates. Sensor response normalisation to standards of known Îµ was found to reduce intersensor variability and provide robust estimates of Î¸ in soil samples with known Î¸. Cross-comparison with a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) instrument carried out in two soil media demonstrates good agreement between the two probes throughout the tested range. The data communication performance of the network was evaluated in terms of packet drop rate at different ranges and sampling frequencies. It was noticed that the drop rate increased with distance from the gateway, while sampling frequency had no effect. Sources of errors associated with probe installation were identified and recommendations are provided for sensor deployment. The off-the-shelf all-in-one solution provided by Sense Cap is low cost, user friendly and suitable for implementation at temporal and spatial scales once the identified shortcomings are addressed. The evaluation presented aims to aid stakeholders and users involved in soil and land management practices including crop production, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and pollutants transport.

TI  - Calibration method to address influences of temperature and electrical conductivity for a low-cost soil water content sensor in the agricultural field
VL  - 255
SN  - NA
AB  - The performance of a low-cost soil water content sensor (5TE, Decagon Devices, Inc.) for monitoring volumetric soil water content in an agricultural field was investigated. Prior to the in-field measurements, calibration methods for the sensor to correct the influences on soil temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil water were established. Dried soil collected from the agricultural field, pure water, and an in-laboratory thermostatic reservoir were used. First, calibration formulas for the soil temperature and EC were obtained using a dataset of laboratory measurements. Second, the soil water content in the field was measured using the 5TE sensor with three different calibration curves, applying: (A) no correction of EC for curves at 20 Â°C, (B) temperature correction only, and (C) temperature and EC corrections. The differences between the sensor and actual measurements were (1) 2.5\%, (2) 2.5\%, and (3) 2.2\% expressed as volumetric soil water content (m3 mâ€“3). Higher accuracy was confirmed in the 5TE-sensor measurements under condition (3) at higher EC values. Finally, we demonstrated that the 5TE sensor with the proposed calibration method is useful for monitoring soil water content in agricultural fields. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determining the dry boundary of the {LST}/{FVC} space for soil moisture monitoring: a semi-empirical method
VL  - 41
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage (LST/FVC) space is a classical model for monitoring soil moisture (SMC) from optical/thermal remote sensing. However, its applications are critically constrained by the determination of the dry and wet boundaries. In this study, a semi-empirical method was provided for determining the dry boundary by introducing a parallel resistance following the Biome-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model to determine the temperature endmembers on the dry boundary. The semi-empirical method was evaluated by comparing with typical theoretical calculation methods in calculating soil moisture index (SMI) based on the LST/FVC space. Public datasets from SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive mission Validation Experiment 2012) experiment, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System) Forcing Dataset were utilized in the evaluation. Results demonstrated that the semi-empirical method has comparable performances with the theoretical methods in monitoring the spatial variation of SMC. The SMIs based on the semi-empirical and theoretical methods are significantly correlated at a high level of Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) around 0.8-0.9 with p-value = 0.05. More importantly, this semi-empirical method requires fewer parameters and does not require a complex iteration calculating process as compared with previous theoretical methods.

TI  - Nonlinear models for soil moisture sensor calibration in tropical mountainous soils
VL  - 79
SN  - NA
AB  - Electromagnetic sensors are widely used to monitor soil water content (Î¸); however, site-specific calibrations are necessary for accurate measurements. This study compares regression models used for calibration of soil moisture sensors and investigates the relation between soil attributes and the adjusted parameters of the specific calibration equations. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the A and B horizons of two Ultisols and two Inceptisols from the Mantiqueira Range in Southeastern Brazil. After saturation, the Theta Probe ML2X was used to obtain the soil dielectric constant (Îµ). Several readings were made, ranging from saturation to oven-dry. After each reading, the samples were weighted to calculate Î¸ (m3 mâ€“3). Fourteen regression models (linear, linearized, and nonlinear) were adjusted to the calibration data and checked for their residue distribution. Only the exponential model with three parameters met the regression assumptions regarding residue distribution. The stepwise regression was used to obtain multiple linear equations to estimate the adjusted parameters of the calibration model from soil attributes, with silt and clay contents providing the best relations. Both the specific and the general calibrations performed well, with RMSE values of 0.02 and 0.03 m3 mâ€“3, respectively. Manufacturer calibration and equations from the literature were much less accurate, reinforcing the need to develop specific calibrations. Â© 2022, University of Sao Paolo. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prediction of deep soil water content (0-5 m) with in-situ and remote sensing data
VL  - 222
SN  - 0341-8162
AB  - Accurate and timely evaluation of soil water content (SWC) in water-limited arid and semiarid regions will provide an essential reference for scientifically based water management strategies and vegetation restoration practices. Theoretical and empirical models based on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer (1-5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013-2016), pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0-5 m profile were developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, soil surface temper-ature, total shortwave broadband albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For different combinations of input pa-rameters, the introduction of in-situ factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error symbolscript 0.039, R2 symbolscript 0.697, mean absolute percentage symbolscript 24.8) and is thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Balanced nutrients are essential for healthy plant growth, but there is no sensor available to monitor essential nutrients such as N and K. Electrical conductivity (EC) is one of the key parameters that could be adopted to monitor nutrient contents because soil EC is influenced by the available nutrients. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the effects of different basal fertilizers, including inorganic, organic, and compost fertilizers, and the application ratio of basal and additional fertilizers on nutrient contents with an EC sensor. The applied basal and additional fertilizer ratios were N 30:70, K 40:60, and N 20:80, K 20:80, respectively, for each fertilizer treatment. The results showed that the EC sensor value was positively associated with water content. The soil EC response increased with inorganic fertilizer and fertigation, and it was positively correlated with soluble nutrients and exchangeable ammonium. The correlation coefficients between sensor EC and soluble nutrients, nitrate, and ammonium nitrogen were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.65, respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) also elucidated that inorganic fertilizer was positively associated with sensor EC, soluble Na, Ca, Mg, and nitrate among variables. This work suggests that soil available nutrients, especially N, could be monitored with an EC sensor, and the soil nutrient status could be regulated to promote better plant growth.

AB  - The irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area is an important food production base. This study was designed to apply the remote sensing to monitor the soil moisture in the irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area. People's Victory Canal Irrigation District (PVCID) was selected to research for the soil moisture monitoring. The crop soil moisture index (CSMI) was designed to be CSMI = FSM=CSSM and the remote sensing soil moisture model was constructed to be RSM0-40= 1 - 0:505 âˆ— TVDI. The remote sensing soil moisture model performed well in monitoring the soil moisture in PVCID. PVCID was mainly threatened by the mild drought between April and May in 2011 and 2012. In conclusion, remote sensing performed well in monitoring the soil moisture and it could be applied to guide the irrigation in the irrigation area in the lower Yellow River Coastal Area.

TI  - Data assimilation of high-resolution thermal and radar remote sensing retrievals for soil moisture monitoring in a drip-irrigated vineyard
VL  - 239
SN  - NA
AB  - Efficient water use assessment and irrigation management is critical for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, especially under changing climate conditions. Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies. Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.

TI  - Laboratory calibration and field validation of soil water content and salinity measurements using the {5TE} sensor
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Capacitance sensors are widely used in agriculture for irrigation and soil management purposes. However, their use under saline conditions is a major challenge, especially for sensors operating with low frequency. Their dielectric readings are often biased by high soil electrical conductivity. New calculation approaches for soil water content (Î¸) and pore water electrical conductivity (ECp), in which apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) is included, have been suggested in recent research. However, these methods have neither been tested with low-cost capacitance probes such as the 5TE (70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) nor for field conditions. Thus, it is important to determine the performance of these approaches and to test the application range using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soils. For this purpose, sandy soil was collected from the Jemna oasis in southern Tunisia and four 5TE sensors were installed in the field at four soil depths. Measurements of apparent dielectric permittivity (Ka), ECa, and soil temperature were taken under different electrical conductivity of soil moisture solutions. Results show that, under field conditions, 5TE accuracy for Î¸ estimation increased when considering the ECa effect. Field calibrated models gave better Î¸ estimation (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.03 m3 mâˆ’3) as compared to laboratory experiments (RMSE = 0.06 m3 mâˆ’3). For ECp prediction, two corrections of the Hilhorst model were investigated. The first approach, which considers the ECa effect on Kâ€™ reading, failed to improve the Hilhorst model for ECp {\textgreater} 3 dS mâˆ’1 for both laboratory and field conditions. However, the second approach, which considers the effect of ECa on the soil parameter K0, increased the performance of the Hilhorst model and gave accurate measurements of ECp using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soil.

TI  - Effects of moss biocrusts on near-surface soil moisture are underestimated in drylands: {Insights} from a heat-pulse soil moisture sensor
VL  - 413
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes and estimating water balance in drylands rely on accurate soil moisture (Î¸) measurements. Surface soil moisture is influenced by the presence and types of biocrusts because they strongly modify surface soil properties and hydrological processes. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to precisely measure the Î¸ of such thin biocrust layer and to evaluate biocrustsâ€™ roles in soil water balance. Due to the large sensing range (usually â‰¥ 5 cm), the most dielectric soil moisture sensors are incapable of accurately measuring near-surface (â‰¤5 cm) Î¸, although they have been widely used for this purpose. Conversely, the heat-pulse (HP) sensor possibly performs better in measuring surface Î¸ of biocrust layer because of its smaller sensing range (1.2 cm). In this study, we assessed the performance of HP sensor in investigating the surface Î¸ differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. We measured surface Î¸ of biocrusts and bare soil for one year at 1 cm depth using HP sensors, and at 2 or 5 cm depths using three common dielectric sensors based on alternative measurement principles. Our results showed that the relationship of Î¸ and heat capacity from the HP sensor was quite well-fitted by a linear regression function (R2 = 0.96), and the Î¸ measured by HP sensor in the field agreed well with the oven-drying Î¸ (root-mean-square error â‰¤ 0.015 cm3 cmâˆ’3 and mean deviation â‰¤ 0.007 cm3 cmâˆ’3). The HP sensor measured a 44\% greater Î¸ under biocrusts compared to bare soil throughout the experimental period, in contrast to lesser differences detected with the other sensors (17\%â€“33\%). Furthermore, the biocrust increased Î¸ by 100\% in the dry season (Nov.âˆ’Apr.) and by 40\% in the wet season (Mayâˆ’Oct.) in contrast to bare soil based on the HP sensor. Moreover, the Î¸ of biocrusts measured by HP sensor was 0.04 cm3 cmâˆ’3 higher than that of bare soil under the periods without rainfall, but the biocrusts increased Î¸ by 0.05â€“0.10 cm3 cmâˆ’3 in contrast to bare soil after rainfall. The apparent differences among different types of sensors were reasonably attributed to their variable sensing ranges and volumes of measured soil. Although the installation depths were different among HP sensor and dielectric sensors, HP sensor was undoubtedly more suitable in measuring near-surface Î¸ and sensitive enough to detect even non-rainfall water inputs (dew, fog, and water vapor sorption) into the soil. In conclusion, the Î¸ differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil are mostly underestimated by common dielectric sensors compared to HP sensors. Therefore, biocrusts play a more vital role in surface water balance of drylands than we generally recognized before. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Wide-area soil moisture sensing is a key element for smart irrigation systems. However, existing soil moisture sensing methods usually fail to achieve both satisfactory mobility and high moisture estimation accuracy. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel soil moisture sensing system, named as SoilId, that combines a UAV and a COTS IR-UWB radar for wide-area soil moisture sensing without the need of burying any battery-powered in-ground device. Specifically, we design a series of novel methods to help SoilId extract soil moisture related features from the received radar signals, and automatically detect and discard the data contaminated by the UAV's uncontrollable motion and the multipath interference. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and carefully design a neural network model to accurately map the extracted radar signal features to soil moisture estimations. We have extensively evaluated SoilId against a variety of real-world factors, including the UAV's uncontrollable motion, the multipath interference, soil surface coverages, and many others. Specifically, the experimental results carried out by our UAV-based system validate that SoilId can push the accuracy limits of RF-based soil moisture sensing techniques to a 50\% quantile MAE of 0.23\%.

TI  - Field calibration of dfm capacitance probes for continuous soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - This study was undertaken to derive textural and lumped site-specific calibration equations for Dirk Friedhelm Mercker (DFM) capacitance probes and evaluate the accuracy levels of the developed calibration equations for continuous soil moisture monitoring in three selected soil types. At each site, 9 probes (3 per plot) were installed in 2 m2 plots, for continuous soil moisture measurements at 5 different depths (viz. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 cm) under dry, moist and wet field conditions. Textural site-specific calibration equations were derived by grouping the same soil textural classes of each site regardless of soil depth, while lumped site-specific calibration equations were derived by grouping all datasets from each site, regardless of soil depth and textural classes. Sensor readings were plotted against gravimetrically measured volumetric soil moisture (Î¸v) for different textural classes as a reference. The coefficient of determination (r2) was used to select the best fit of the regression function. The developed calibration equations were evaluated using an independent dataset. The results indicated that all developed textural and lumped site-specific calibration equations were linear functions, with r2 values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. Relationships between the measured and estimated Î¸v from calibration equations were reasonable at all sites, with r2 values greater than 0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.010 to 0.020 m3âˆ™m-3. The results also indicated that textural site-specific calibration equations (RMSE {\textless} 0.018 m3âˆ™m-3) should be given preference over lumped site-specific calibrations (RMSE {\textless} 0.020 m3âˆ™m-3) to attain more accurate Î¸v measurements. The findings of this study suggest that once DFM capacitance probes are calibrated per site, they can be reliably used for accurate in-situ soil moisture measurements. The developed calibration equations can be applied with caution in other sites with similar soil types to attained reliable in-situ soil moisture measurements.

TI  - Developing a strategy for the national coordinated soil moisture monitoring network
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical land surface variable, affecting a wide variety of climatological, agricultural, and hydrological processes. Determining the current soil moisture status is possible via a variety of methods, including in situ monitoring, remote sensing, and numerical modeling. Although all of these approaches are rapidly evolving, there is no cohesive strategy or framework to integrate these diverse information sources to develop and disseminate coordinated national soil moisture products that will improve our ability to understand climate variability. The National Coordinated Soil Moisture Monitoring Network initiative has developed a national strategy for network coordination with NOAA's National Integrated Drought Information System. The strategy is currently in review within NOAA, and work is underway to implement the initial milestones of the strategy. This update reviews the goals and steps being taken to establish this national-scale coordination for soil moisture monitoring in the United States. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Remote sensing-based vegetation and soil moisture constraints reduce irrigation estimation uncertainty
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the human water footprint and its impact on the hydrological cycle is essential to inform water management under climate change. Despite efforts in estimating irrigation water withdrawals in earth system models, uncertainties and discrepancies exist within and across modeling systems conditioned by model structure, irrigation parameterization, and the choice of input datasets. Achieving model reliability could be much more challenging for data-sparse regions, given limited access to ground truth for parameterization and validation. Here, we demonstrate the potential of utilizing remotely sensed vegetation and soil moisture observations in constraining irrigation estimation in the Noah-MP land surface model. Results indicate that the two constraints together can effectively reduce model sensitivity to the choice of irrigation parameterization by 7\%-43\%. It also improves the characterization of the spatial patterns of irrigation and its impact on evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture by correcting for vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This study highlights the importance of utilizing remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation measurements in detecting irrigation signals and correcting for vegetation growth. Integrating the two remote sensing datasets into the model provides an effective and less feature engineered approach to constraining the uncertainty of irrigation modeling. Such strategies can be potentially transferred to other modeling systems and applied to regions across the globe. Â© 2022 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) exists at the land-atmosphere interface and serves as a key driving variable that affects global water balance and vegetation growth. Its importance in climate and earth system studies necessitates a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of mainstream global remote sensing/reanalysis SM products. In this study, we conducted a thorough verification of ten global remote sensing/reanalysis SM products: SMAP DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, SMAP-IB, SMOS IC, SMOS L3, LPRM\_C1, LPRM\_C2, LPRM\_X, and ERA5-Land. The verification was based on ground observation data from the International SM Network (ISMN), considering both static factors (such as climate zone, land cover type, and soil type) and dynamic factors (including SM, leaf area index, and land surface temperature). Our goal was to assess the accuracy and applicability of these products. We analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of global SM and discussed the vegetation effect on SM products. Additionally, we examined the global high-frequency fluctuations in the SMAP L-VOD product, along with their correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, and vegetation water content. Our findings revealed that product quality was higher in regions located in tropical and arid zones, closed shrubs, loose rocky soil, and gray soil with low soil moisture, low leaf area index, and high average land surface temperature. Among the evaluated products, SMAP-IB, SMAP DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, and ERA5-Land consistently performed better, demonstrating a good ability to capture the spatial and temporal variations in SM and showing a correlation of approximately 0.60 with ISMN. SMOS IC and SMOS L3 followed in performance, while LPRM\_C1, LPRM\_C2, and LPRM\_X exhibited relatively poor results in SM inversion. These findings serve as a valuable reference for improving satellite/reanalysis SM products and conducting global-scale SM studies. Â© 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Regional soil water content monitoring based on time-frequency spectrogram of low-frequency swept acoustic signal
VL  - 441
SN  - NA
AB  - Acoustic waves offer a non-destructive, safe, and cost-effective means of monitoring the environment, with a potential application in soil water content monitoring. However, extracting soil water information from acoustic signals is still challenging. To tackle this issue, we have developed a low-frequency swept acoustic signal detection device and system. We conducted soil penetration testing using low-frequency swept acoustic signals. The swept-frequency acoustic signals passing through the soil were transformed into timeâ€“frequency spectrogram. Using the Swin-Transformer model, we established a regression model between the timeâ€“frequency spectrogram of the swept frequencies and the soil water content. Predictions were made both on a laboratory test dataset and through field trials using the calibrated model. The results indicate that the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values between the observed and the model's outputs of water content (\%) for the test laboratory dataset are 0.191, 0.081, and 0.999, respectively, using the Swin-Transformer model. In the case of the field trials, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values between the predicted and observed values are 6.715 \%, 1.829 \%, and 0.711, respectively. These studies demonstrate that this method is highly effective in predicting soil water content, with the best results achieved at a resolution of 20 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) and within the frequency range of 260â€“360 Hz. It provides an efficient approach for acoustic soil water content detection, effectively resolves the difficulty in building models caused by the single-parameter limitation in traditional acoustic model.

VL  - 27
SN  - NA
AB  - The article presents an in situ sensor to monitor soil moisture and water salinity by measuring soil permittivity and conductivity at a frequency 24 MHz via an admittance approach. It addresses difficulties encountered in other permittivity-based sensors. A self-balanced bridge provides on one measurement a digital output linear to capacitance and conductance of electrodes in soil with low offset, high phase resolution, and taking into account all parasitic impedances. Circuit design and procedures to achieve it are described, using electric circuit theory and component specifications. Probe geometry, two parallel cylinders, permits insertion in soil from surface, low disturbances and a high sample volume around electrodes. It provides an analytical relation to convert admittance to soil permittivity. Calibration of a sensor with air, alcohols and water fixes its sensitivity and residual phase and inductance for an uncertainty lower than 2\% over a range up to 80 and 200 mS mâ€“1. Identical sensors can use same parameters after adjusting in one simple operation bridge phases. Thermal drift and its consequences on soil variable measurement are investigated and physical origins identified. It permits to reduce the phase drift within Â±150 ppm Â°Câ€“ 1rad to keep accuracy.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Large-scale measurements of soil moisture play a critical role in many fields, such as agriculture, hydrology, and engineering. The distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technology, based on a dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP), is a novel approach to realizing large-scale soil moisture estimation. However, the application of the method is limited by the complex optical cable layout, calculation algorithm, and lack of standardized heating strategy. In this paper, an improved DPHP-DTS method considering the soil bulk density was proposed. The measurement accuracy of the DPHP-DTS method under different heating strategies was studied in laboratory experiments, and its long-term stability in regard to the monitoring of soil moisture during natural evaporation in different soils was tested. The results show that the improved DPHP-DTS method can accurately measure the soil moisture, and the fitting algorithm can reduce the error caused by the accuracy of the DTS temperature measurement under the low-power heating strategy. Its measurement accuracy increases with the increase in the heating strength and duration. In addition, the improved DPHP-DTS method can describe soil evaporation in both sand and loess with good reliability and stability. Â© 2022 by the authors.

VL  - 62
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture can vary spatially at the scale of agricultural fields ( 10-100 m), which is generally too fine to resolve using passive radiometric methods. Active radar provides an opportunity for finer resolution measurements; in particular, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) closure phase parameter is sensitive to changing soil moisture. We have developed a model showing that a systematic nonzero closure phase can result from scattering from objects at different depths in a medium of time-varying dielectric, such as from changes in soil moisture. The model predicts that interference between surface and subsurface reflections is needed for the closure phase to be nonzero. We find that, under certain circumstances, we can estimate soil moisture from the closure phase using a data reduction approach that includes a cumulative sum of the closure phase over time and the removal of a trend. The correlation between the cumulative closure phase and soil moisture suggests that the closure phase is related to the change in soil moisture. We examine a large test region in Oklahoma, where the detrended cumulative closure phase from Sentinel-1 data demonstrates some agreement with in situ soil moisture measurements. In other areas, the match is weaker, implying a terrain dependence on the quality of fit. The cumulative InSAR closure phase promises to provide a valuable new method to remotely estimate soil moisture. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - DeepQC}: {A} deep learning system for automatic quality control of in-situ soil moisture sensor time series data
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Amidst changing climate, real-time soil moisture monitoring is vital for the development of in-season decision support tools to help farmers manage weather-related risks in agriculture. Precision Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) recently established a real-time soil moisture monitoring network across the central, Midwest, and eastern U.S., but continuous field-scale sensor observations often come with data gaps and anomalies. To maintain the data quality and continuity needed for developing decision tools, a quality control system is necessary. The International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) introduced the Flagit module for anomaly detection in soil moisture time series observations. However, under certain conditions, Flagit's threshold and spectral based quality control approaches may underperform in identifying anomalies. Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to detect time series anomalies in time series data in various disciplines. However, their use in agriculture for anomaly detection in time series datasets has not been yet investigated. This study focuses on developing a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, referred to as DeepQC, to identify anomalies in soil moisture time series data. Manual flagged PSA observations were used for training, validation, and testing the model, following an 80:10:10 split. The study then compared the DeepQC and Flagit-based estimates to assess their relative performance. Flagit correctly flagged 95.8 \% of the correct observations and 50.3 \% of the anomaly observations, indicating its limitations in identifying anomalies, particularly at sites consists of more than 30 \% anomalies. On the other hand, the DeepQC correctly flagged 89.8 \% of the correct observations and 99.5 \% of the anomalies, with overall accuracy of 95.6 \%, in significantly less time, demonstrating its superiority over Flagit approach. Importantly, the performance of the DeepQC remained consistent regardless of the number of anomalies in site observations. Given the promising results obtained with the DeepQC, future studies will focus on implementing and finetuning this model on national and global soil moisture networks. Â© 2024

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Waterlogging crop disasters are caused by continuous and excessive soil water in the upper layer of soil. In order to enable waterlogging monitoring, it is important to collect continuous and accurate soil moisture data. The distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM) is selected as the basic hydrological model for soil moisture estimation and winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring. To handle the error accumulation of the DHSVM and the poor continuity of remote sensing (RS) inversion data, an agro-hydrological model that assimilates RS inversion data into the DHSVM is used for winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring. The soil moisture content maps retrieved from satellite images are assimilated into the DHSVM by the successive correction method. Moreover, in order to reduce the modeling error accumulation, monthly and real-time RS inversion maps that truly reflect local soil moisture distributions are regularly assimilated into the agro-hydrological modeling process each month. The results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the simulated soil moisture value at two in situ experiment points were 0.02077 and 0.02383, respectively, which were 9.96\% and 12.02\% of the measured value. From the accurate and continuous soil moisture results based on the agro-hydrological assimilation model, the waterlogging-damaged ratio and grade distribution information for winter-wheat waterlogging were extracted. The results indicate that there were almost no high-damaged-ratio and severe waterlogging damage areas in Lixin County, which was consistent with the local field investigation.

AB  - The existing soil moisture sensing mechanism of the heat pulse probe (HPP) assumes the ideal condition of the soil while overlooking the physics of the device and the composition of the soil and its properties. In the present study, we propose modifications to the soil moisture sensing model of HPP by considering its physical parameters and their appropriate association with the thermal properties of soil and its mineral composition. Primarily, a novel model for the heat strength of the probe of HPP is proposed and examined. It results in  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9809\$ , adjusted  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9721\$ , and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.73 W/m for experimentally measured values versus obtained values of heat strength using the proposed model. Subsequently, a soil composition-based model is developed resulting in a 19\%â€“25\% change in the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the soil. A final model of soil moisture estimation is developed by combining the heat strength of the probe of HPP, and the bulk volumetric heat capacity and porosity of the soil. The proposed model suggests improved results in soil moisture measurement in the range of âˆ’0.004 to 0.306  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}\$  which can be useful for different applications and several types of soil. Moreover, the model-predicted values of soil moisture are validated with experimental values in previous studies and linked with futuristic applications.  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9763\$ , adjusted  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9527\$ , and RMSE of 0.032  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}\$  are obtained for soil moisture measured experimentally versus values obtained using the proposed model.

TI  - Towards disentangling heterogeneous soil moisture patterns in cosmic-ray neutron sensor footprints
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for non-invasive soil moisture estimations at the field scale. The derivation of soil moisture generally relies on secondary cosmic-ray neutrons in the epithermal to fast energy ranges. Most approaches and processing techniques for observed neutron intensities are based on the assumption of homogeneous site conditions or of soil moisture patterns with correlation lengths shorter than the measurement footprint of the neutron detector. However, in view of the non-linear relationship between neutron intensities and soil moisture, it is questionable whether these assumptions are applicable. In this study, we investigated how a non-uniform soil moisture distribution within the footprint impacts the CRNS soil moisture estimation and how the combined use of epithermal and thermal neutrons can be advantageous in this case. Thermal neutrons have lower energies and a substantially smaller measurement footprint around the sensor than epithermal neutrons. Analyses using the URANOS (Ultra RApid Neutron-Only Simulation) Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the measurement footprint dynamics at a study site in northeastern Germany revealed that the thermal footprint mainly covers mineral soils in the near-field to the sensor while the epithermal footprint also covers large areas with organic soils. We found that either combining the observed thermal and epithermal neutron intensities by a rescaling method developed in this study or adjusting all parameters of the transfer function leads to an improved calibration against the reference soil moisture measurements in the near-field compared to the standard approach and using epithermal neutrons alone. We also found that the relationship between thermal and epithermal neutrons provided an indicator for footprint heterogeneity. We, therefore, suggest that the combined use of thermal and epithermal neutrons offers the potential of a spatial disaggregation of the measurement footprint in terms of near-and far-field soil moisture dynamics.

TI  - Electronic sensing combined with machine learning models for predicting soil nutrient content
VL  - 221
SN  - NA
AB  - Traditional methods for detecting soil nutrient content usually involve laborious and time-consuming experimental procedures, hindering the efficiency of soil analysis and making them less suitable for large-scale soil testing. Therefore, there exists a pressing need to develop innovative solutions. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between soil pyrolysis gas and soil nutrient content by establishing a model that combined electronic sensing and machine learning to predict soil nutrient content. The initial data sets were derived from utilizing pyrolysis gas response curves of soil samples acquired from 10 distinct gas sensors. Afterward, we innovatively proposed a sensor array optimization (SAO) method based on the dynamic feature importance (DFI) of the Random Forest-Pearson Correlation Coefficient (RF-PCC) to identify the optimal sensor combinations for four soil nutrients. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Multilayer Perceptron-Random Forest (MLP-RF) models were employed to predict the soil nutrient content based on the electronic sense to address the challenges associated with developing a unified model. The MLP-RF models showed superior performance compared with the other three models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) for the four soil nutrients ranging from 0.54 to 0.94. Overall, our research not only provides approximately quantitative predictive outcomes but also contributes to a better understanding of a new approach for detecting soil nutrient content.

TI  - \textit{{In} situ} mesoscale soil moisture content monitoring based on global navigation satellite system interferometric reflectometry and ensemble modeling
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - The existing point-scale or large-scale soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring techniques cannot entirely satisfy the requirements of in situ SMC monitoring for agricultural purposes. We proposed a framework for in situ mesoscale SMC monitoring based on global navigation satellite system interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) and ensemble modeling technique. The framework consists of a data collecting and preparing system and an SMC retrieval system. The amplitude, phase, and detection depth, which are the GNSS-IR signal-to-noise ratio parameters, were positively and negatively correlated with the volumetric SMC data, respectively. In the SMC retrieval stage, five kinds of models including linear regression, multi-linear regression, k-neighbor regressor, support vector regressor, and random forest (RF) was tested as the first-order model. Two kinds of swarm optimization algorithms including sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were examined for models' hyper-parameter optimization. The results show that the RF performed best and had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.798, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.043 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set. Both the SSA and PSO are effective for models' optimization. After input variable selection, the second-order ensemble RF model outperformed the first-order RF model and had an R-2 of 0.819, an RMSE of 0.040 cm(3)/cm(3), and an MAE of 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set. The proposed framework is potentially valuable for popularization because of its cost-effectiveness and high accuracy. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - A {Vegetation}-{Temperature}-{Radiation}-{Composite} {Method} for {Downscaling} {Soil} {Moisture
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - To address limitations in regional-scale applications of passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products, various downscaling methods have been proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of SM. Nonetheless, these downscaled methods, which are based on optical and thermal infrared data, face challenges in vegetated areas and are prone to inaccuracies due to cloud cover affecting ancillary data. In response to these challenges, we introduced a novel approach termed the vegetation-temperature-radiation-composite (VTRC) method. This method recognizes the robust interaction between vegetation and SM and also appreciates the high sensitivity of surface temperature variation to surface net solar radiation (SSR) in relation to SM. Besides, the VTRC method combines ERA5 data with its high temporal resolution and MODIS data to counteract data loss due to cloud coverage. Applied to downscale the ESA CCI SM products from 0.25Â° to 0.01Â° spatial resolution, the VTRC method is validated over Castilla y LeÃ³n (Spain) and Anhui province (China). The VTRC method demonstrates a significant improvement compared to the feature space-based downscaled method and the original ESA CCI products, achieving higher correlation coefficient (R ) of 0.56 and 0.66 textm{\textasciicircum}3/textm{\textasciicircum}3 in humid and semi-arid regions with ground observations, respectively. Furthermore, it maintains a consistent unbiased root mean square error (ub RMSE) of 0.05 textm{\textasciicircum}3/textm{\textasciicircum}3 in both regions. Additionally, the inclusion of vegetation information notably improves the accuracy in comparison to solely using land surface temperature (LST) and SSR. Significantly, evaluations across varying vegetation cover surfaces revealed enhanced accuracy, especially in regions with abundant vegetation. Â© 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Regional scale soil moisture content estimation based on multi-source remote sensing parameters
VL  - 41
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is a basic condition for crop growth, and a key parameter for crop yield prediction and drought monitoring. An advantage of large-scale synchronous observation using remote sensing technology is that it provides the possibility of dynamic monitoring of soil moisture content in a large area. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of accurately estimating soil moisture content at a regional scale by combining ground hyper-spectral data with multispectral remote sensing (Sentinel-2) data. The results showed that the different mathematical transformations increased the correlation between soil spectral reflectance and SMC to varying degrees. Hyper-spectral optimized index normalized difference index (NDI) ((B-769 similar to 797 - B-848 similar to 881/B-769 similar to 797 + B-848 similar to 881); (B-842 - B-740/B-842 + B-740)) derived from the transformed reflectance (the first-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R))', second-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R)) `') showed significant correlation (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.61; r = 0.47) with SMC, and the correlation coefficient values higher than difference index (DI) and ratio index (RI). From the performance of 12 prediction models which were taken optimized indices as independent variables, the central wavelength reflectance model (Log (1/R))â€ and the average wavelength reflectance model ((Log (1/R)) ` presented higher validation coefficients (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.61, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.09\%, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1.82; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 3.48\%, RPD = 1.91) compared with other models. When verifying the accuracy, the model yields R-2 values of 0.619 and 0.701. These results indicated that the two-band hyper-spectral optimized indices (NDI) as an optimal indicator for quickly and accurately soil moisture content estimation. Combining the ground hyper-spectral data and satellite remote sensing image regional scale soil moisture content prediction provides a scientific reference for land-space integrated soil moisture content remote sensing monitoring.

AB  - Real time measurements of soil water content play a critical role in many fields of science as agronomy, geology, engineering, and hydrology. In the last years, agriculture has become one of the most important application fields of soil water sensors technology in order to optimize the irrigation process and to guarantee sustainable water resources management. This work provides a review on the latest emerging methodologies based on optical fiber sensing for soil moisture monitoring for agricultural and hydrological applications. In particular, the main studies referring to optical fiber sensors based on a variation of the refractive index of the external medium, sensors based on heated distributed temperature sensor (HDTS) and sensors based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) or Long Period Gratings (LPG) are here explored. Finally, some approaches based on the NIR absorbance spectroscopy are proposed for measuring the soil water content. Most of these approaches and technologies are still in a prototyping phase and only few of them are properly evaluated in situ real context.

TI  - Mandarin irrigation scheduling by means of frequency domain reflectometry soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 235
SN  - NA
AB  - The accurate estimation of plant water needs is the first step for achieving high crop water productivity. The main objective of the work was to develop an irrigation scheduling procedure for mandarin orchards under Mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture according to different phenological periods. The proposed methodology includes a definition part where the threshold values were established relating the treesâ€™ stem water potential and the volumetric soil water content measured with Frequency Domain Reflectometry probes. A second part includes the steps for standardizing measurements from capacitance probes by using the LEACHM hydrological simulation model to take into account the sensor-to-sensor variations. Finally, an extrapolation procedure based on soil water retention curves was used for adapting critical soil water content thresholds to different soil conditions. Field evaluations were made in a citrus orchard located in eastern Spain during two seasons. Standardize critical soil water contents were: i) 24 \% vol. for post-harvest, bloom - fruit set and phase III of fruit growth; ii) 27 \% vol. for phase I of fruit growth, and iii) 29 \% vol. for phase II of fruit growth with average daily air vapour pressure deficit values ranging between 0.2 - 0.4; 0.9â€“1.1 and 1.1â€“1.3 kPa, respectively. When implemented in the orchard, the sensor-based strategy resulted in water saving of 26 \% respect to a control treatment, irrigated using the standard FAO-56 approach, without significant differences in yield and increasing the crop water productivity by 33 \%. In conclusion, we suggest that the determination and use of the critical soil water content is a useful tool for scheduling irrigation. The proposed standardization and extrapolation methodology allows the irrigation strategy to be applied to other mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Monitoring soil moisture dynamics using electrical resistivity tomography under homogeneous field conditions
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - There is a gap between lab experiments where resistivityâ€“soil moisture relations are generally very good and field studies in complex environmental settings where relations are always less good and complicated by many factors. An experiment was designed where environmental settings are more controlled, the best outside laboratory, to assess the transferability from lab to outdoor. A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the use of electric resistivity tomography (ERT) for monitoring soil moisture dynamics over a period of 67 days. A homogeneous site in the central part of The Netherlands was selected consisting of grass pasture on an aeolian sand soil profile. ERT values were correlated to gravimetric soil moisture samples for five depths at three different dates. Correlations ranged from 0.43 to 0.73 and were best for a soil depth of 90 cm. Resistivity patterns over time (time-lapse ERT) were analyzed and related to rainfall events where rainfall infiltration patterns could be identified. Duplicate ERT measurements showed that the noise level of the instrument and measurements is low and generally below 3\% for the soil profile below the mixed layer but above the groundwater. Although the majority of the measured resistivity patterns could be well explained, some artefacts and dynamics were more difficult to clarify, even so in this homogeneous field situation. The presence of an oak tree with its root structure and a ditch with surface water with higher conductivity may have an impact on the resistivity pattern in the soil profile and over time. We conclude that ERT allows for detailed spatial measurement of local soil moisture dynamics resulting from precipitation although field experiments do not yield accuracies similar to laboratory experiments. ERT approaches are suitable for detailed spatial analyses where probe or sample-based methods are limited in reach or repeatability. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Downscaling {Passive} {Microwave} {Soil} {Moisture} {Estimates} {Using} {Stand}-{Alone} {Optical} {Remote} {Sensing} {Data
VL  - 62
SN  - NA
AB  - Downscaling of passive microwave derived soil moisture (SM) using thermal-infrared remote sensing data is a common method to obtain higher resolution SM information. However, these thermal-based downscaling methods are limited by their requirement of daily reparameterization because thermal-infrared data are influenced by both the SM content and weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a new method called downscaling method based on optical trapezoid model (DespiTe), which improves the spatial resolution of passive microwave derived SM products by using only optical remote sensing data. This method relies on the linear relationship between SM and the shortwave-infrared transformed (STR) reflectance, which is less affected by weather conditions. Thus, the DespiTe method needs to be parameterized only once for each area. By establishing statistical relationships between optical parameters (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and STR) and passive microwave derived SM observations, the DespiTe method enables a higher spatial resolution SM estimation to be derived. The downscaling results from DespiTe were evaluated with aircraft and in situ observed SM data acquired during the SMAPEx-4 and SMAPVEX16 field experiments. Moreover, these results were compared with those from disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DisPATCh), a commonly used thermal-based downscaling method. A comparison against aircraft SM data showed that the DespiTe method achieved an unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.026 m3/m3, which outperformed the DisPATCh method that achieved a ubRMSE of 0.059 m3/m3.

TI  - Root-zone soil moisture estimation based on remote sensing data and deep learning
VL  - 212
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by remote sensing, limited to the top few centimeters ({\textless}5 cm). Researchers have attempted to estimate root-zone soil moisture using multiple regression, data assimilation, and data-driven methods. However, correlations between root-zone soil moisture and its related variables, including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear, which is difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil moisture estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or spatial correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model, known to capture spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale sequential datasets with the advantage of dealing with spatiotemporal sequence-forecasting problem, was used in this study to estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation data, the physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and spatiotemporal vertical soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model training and verification. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors were selected as predictive variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that the fitting coefficients (R2) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example, R2 increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests that a combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool capable of predicting spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy on a large scale.

AB  - The Consistent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Soil Moisture (CASM) dataset is a global, consistent, and long-term, remote sensing soil moisture (SM) dataset  created using machine learning. It is based on the NASA Soil Moisture Active  Passive (SMAP) satellite mission SM data and is aimed at extrapolating SMAP-like  quality SM back in time using previous satellite microwave platforms. CASM  represents SM in the top soil layer, and it is defined on a global 25â€‰km EASE-2  grid and for 2002-2020 with a 3-day temporal resolution. The seasonal cycle is  removed for the neural network training to ensure its skill is targeted at  predicting SM extremes. CASM comparison to 367 global in-situ SM monitoring sites  shows a SMAP-like median correlation of 0.66. Additionally, the SM product  uncertainty was assessed, and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties were  estimated and included in the dataset. CASM dataset can be used to study a wide  range of hydrological, carbon cycle, and energy processes since only a consistent  long-term dataset allows assessing changes in water availability and water  stress.

TI  - Soil fertility assessment for optimal agricultural use using remote sensing and {GIS} technologies
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - An uneasy population increase requires expansion of the agricultural area. Egypt has a strategic direction in expanding agricultural areas, which highlights the objective of the research that is to assess soil fertility through its geographical assessment and remote sensing. The examination region of this investigation is situated in north region of west desert, about 55 km, west of Cairo, Egypt. A semi-detail survey was carried out using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) for the study. The results found the high suitable areas (S1) for field crops; barley and wheat were about 54.7\% for each of the total area, while for corn and beans were about 44.9\% for each of the total area, while S1 areas for vegetable crops; tomato, eggplant, and melon were 67.8, 71.2, and 53.2\% of the total area, respectively, while S2 for pepperâ€“zucchini was about 65.4 and 49.7\% of the total area, respectively. But for fruit trees, S1 is for pears (60.3\%), pomegranates (50.9\%), and palms (80.2\%) while S2 for olives (30.3\%), Figs. (30.3\%), almonds (10.4\%), vines (19.7\%), and peaches (20.5\%). To reduce water losses is by improving the means of delivery and raising the efficiency of irrigation, by evaluating the appropriate situation of the irrigation system for soil quality in the study area, and by choosing the appropriate methods of irrigation in the region to raise efficiency in rationalizing consumption and reducing losses. Drip and sprinkle irrigation suitability for the entire area are moderate to high, where soil texture factor is limiting drip irrigation method while wind speed and soil texture factors are limiting sprinkle irrigation in the area.

TI  - Information-based uncertainty decomposition in dual-channel microwave remote sensing of soil moisture
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission characterizes global spatiotemporal patterns in surface soil moisture using dual L-band microwave retrievals of horizontal (TBh) and vertical (TBv) polarized microwave brightness temperatures through a modeled mechanistic relationship between vegetation opacity, surface scattering albedo, and soil effective temperature (Teff). Although this model has been validated against in situ soil moisture, there is a lack of systematic characterization of where and why SMAP estimates deviate from the in situ observations. Here, we assess how the information content of in situ soil moisture observations from the US Climate Reference Network contrasts with (1) the information contained within raw SMAP observations (i.e., "informational random uncertainty") derived from TBh, TBv, and Teff themselves and with (2) the information contained in SMAP's dual-channel algorithm (DCA) soil moisture estimates (i.e., "informational model uncertainty") derived from the model's inherent structure and parameterizations. The results show that, on average, 80Äâ‚¬Â¯\% of the information in the in situ soil moisture is unexplained by SMAP DCA soil moisture estimates. Loss of information in the DCA modeling process contributes 35Äâ‚¬Â¯\% of the unexplained information, while the remainder is induced by a lack of additional explanatory power within TBh, TBv, and Teff. Overall, retrieval quality of SMAP DCA soil moisture, denoted as the Pearson correlation coefficient between SMAP DCA soil moisture and in situ soil moisture, is negatively correlated with the informational uncertainties, with slight differences across different land covers. The informational model uncertainty (Pearson correlation of -0.59) was found to be more influential than the informational random uncertainty (Pearson correlation of -0.34), suggesting that the poor performance of SMAP DCA at some locations is driven by model parameterization and/or structure and not underlying satellite measurements of TBh and TBv. A decomposition of mutual information between TBh, TBv, and DCA soil moisture shows that on average 58Äâ‚¬Â¯\% of information provided by TBh and TBv to DCA estimates is redundant. The amount of information redundantly and synergistically provided by TBh and TBv was found to be closely related (Pearson correlations of 0.79 and -0.82, respectively) to the retrieval quality of SMAP DCA. TBh and TBv tend to contribute large redundant information to DCA estimates under surfaces or conditions where DCA makes better retrievals. This study provides a baseline approach that can also be applied to evaluate other remote sensing models and understand informational loss as satellite retrievals are translated to end-user products.

AB  - Soil moisture is essential parameter in the Earthâ€™s surface. The information provided by soil moisture plays a vital role in agricultural production, eco-environmental protection, water and land resources management, etc. Meanwhile, the accurate monitoring of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is of great significance for the engineering geological assessment and geological disaster prevention. Monitoring and retrieving soil moisture via remote sensing data and mathematical models are the main research methods at present and the crucial issue is how to eliminate the influence of other surface and soil parameters like roughness and soil bulk density, and the interference of vegetated areas to electromagnetic waves. Nowadays, many branches of retrieval methods have been developed, and researchers are integrating multiple models to improve the retrieval accuracy. This paper summarizes the present research status and progress of soil moisture retrieval via remote sensing based on four kinds of models: empirical model, semi-empirical model, physical model, and machine learning. The soil moisture products are summarized and listed at the same time. The difficulties and issues in the present research are discussed and the future outlook is explored. Â© 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Amid recent climate difficulties, integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) strategies are vital in restoring soil fertility, enhancing yield, and achieving the farmer communityâ€™s well-being. This study examines ISFMâ€™s adoption and impact on wheat yields in Punjab, Pakistan, by employing an endogenous switching regression model (ESRM). The selection equation highlights the multiple factors such as age, gender, education, extension access, credit access, and social influence as essential predictors of ISFM adoption. Treatment effects showed that the average wheat yield is higher for adopters. The findings suggest refining the current institutional system will enhance adoption and food security by improving agricultural production. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Remote sensing of soil moisture using {Rydberg} atoms and satellite signals of opportunity.
VL  - 14
SN  - 2045-2322
AB  - Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to study natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy cycles, weather and air  quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A major challenge with current  approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band microwave  electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable retrievals. This  results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system  processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology from a single compact  instrument, where co-located broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to  sense multiple variables simultaneously or over a short duration. Rydberg atomic  sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be  dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for RF  band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted  signals such as fromÂ navigation and communication satellites to enable remote  sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth  system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic  systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use  signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote  sensing of soil moisture.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) controls vegetation transpiration and hydraulic distribution processes and plays a key role in energy and water exchange between land surface and atmosphere; hence, accurate estimation of RZSM is crucial for agricultural irrigation management practices. Traditional methods to measure soil moisture at stations are laborious and spatially uneven, making it difficult to obtain soil moisture data on a large scale. Remote sensing techniques can provide soil moisture in a large-scale range, but they can only provide surface soil moisture (SSM) with a depth of approximately 5-10 cm. In order to obtain a large range of soil moisture for deeper soil layers, especially the crop root zone with a depth of about 100-200 cm, numerous methods based on remote sensing inversion have been proposed. This paper analyzes and summarizes the research progress of remote sensing-based RZSM estimation methods in the past few decades and classifies these methods into four categories: empirical methods, semi-empirical methods, physics-based methods, and machine learning methods. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are outlined. Additionally an outlook on the future development of RZSM estimation methods is made and discussed.

TI  - Remote sensing-based retrieval of soil moisture content using stacking ensemble learning models
VL  - 34
SN  - NA
AB  - Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methodsâ€”classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.

TI  - Towards near real-time national-scale soil water content monitoring using data fusion as a downscaling alternative
VL  - 609
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water is a critical component of the water balance to make water management decisions at multiple scales. While soil water can be sensed remotely, this is generally at coarse scales ({\textgreater} 12.5 km). In addition, soil moisture products developed at field scale resolutions ({\textless} 250 m) have been mostly limited to shallow observations (up to 10 cm depth) and are impacted by land use. The objective of this study was to create an accurate downscaled soil water content product at multiple depths and at a fine 90 m resolution by fusing modelled and remote sensing datasets via deep learning. Reference data was based on the OzFlux and Oznet networks. Covariates included the North America Space Agency (NASA) United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) remote sensing data assimilation model, Sentinel 1 from Copernicus, surface reflectance, land surface temperature and land cover from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and gridded soil properties. Two model approaches were used including a multilayer perceptron for the surface (0â€“10 cm), and recurrent neural networks for the surface/subsurface (0â€“30 cm and 30â€“60 cm) soil water content. The surface prediction performance resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation of 0.073, 0.057, and 0.74, degrading in depth to 0.07, 0.062, and 0.5. Overall, these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of NASA-USDA SMAP (10 km resolution) and the Australian Landscape Water Balance (5 km resolution) simulated soil water contents. Land use/land cover (LULC) are important explaining factors for performance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicate high importance of NASA-USDA SMAP for surface predictions, while soil properties and LULC increase in importance with depth.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The conventional methods of estimating soil water content (SWC) are mainly based on in situ measurements at sampling points and remote sensing measurements over an entire region. In view of these methods, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mesoscale, noncontact SWC estimation technology that can provide more accurate and timely estimates of SWC over a larger area. In this study, we estimated SWC using both CRNS and soil-mounted detectors in farmland and mountainous areas, and evaluated the accuracy of the estimations at two experimental sites. Ultra-rapid adaptable neutron-only simulation (URANOS) was used to simulate the detection radius and depth of the two experimental sites and to obtain the spatial weights of the CRNS footprint. The results show that the theoretical range of detection was reduced in farmland compared to mountainous areas during the experimental period, suggesting that farmland retained more SWC even with less precipitation. Spatial weights were simulated to calculate the SWC of sampling points, and the weighted and averaged SWC were then correlated with CRNS. The weighting calculation improves the accuracy of CRNS estimations, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.645 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046 cm3Â·cmâˆ’3 for farmland, and reproduces the daily dynamics of SWC. The R2 and RMSE in mountainous areas are 0.773 and 0.049 cm3Â·cmâˆ’3, respectively, and the estimation accuracy of CRNS cannot be improved by the weighting calculation. The estimation accuracy of CRNS is acceptable in both regions, but the mountainous terrain obstructs neutron transmission, causing a deviation between the actual and theoretical neutron footprints in mountainous areas. Thus, the accuracy of SWC estimation is limited in mountainous terrain. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that CRNS is suitable for use in farmland and mountainous areas and that further attention should be given to the effects of topography and vegetation when it is applied in mountainous environments.

AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing has drawn increased attention in precision agriculture. Lightweight optical and thermal sensors have been used widely on UAVs for a range of applications, and have been proposed by some as the best approach to map soil moisture at farm scales. However, passive microwave remote sensing has been widely acknowledged as the most accurate soil moisture mapping technology, and adopted by the soil moisture and ocean salinity and soil moisture active and passive satellite missions. Accordingly, it is postulated that this will also be the best technique for UAV-based near-surface soil moisture remote sensing, overcoming the spatial resolution limitation from low earth orbit altitude. Being so far limited by sensor availability, only a small number of studies have illustrated the potential of UAV-based near-surface soil moisture mapping using L-band microwave radiometers, and there has been no direct comparison with the thermal-optical alternative. To guide the design of future UAV-based soil moisture mapping systems, airborne optical, thermal infrared, and passive microwave observations collected from a scientific aircraft at low altitude over a center-pivot irrigation farm in Tasmania, Australia were used in this study to simulate UAV-based observations, and the performances of the thermal-optical and microwave techniques when compared at 75 m scale. The L-band microwave emission showed a superior sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture, and a higher and more consistent soil moisture retrieval accuracy than thermal-optical, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.05â€“0.06 m3/m3 and 0.05â€“0.09 m3/m3, respectively.

AB  - Nitrogen is a vital ingredient for plant development and growth. It is one of the most crucial indicators of soil fertility and crop growth conditions. For the monitoring of nitrogen loss patterns and the development of crop nitrogen fertilizer application strategies, an accurate determination of soil nitrogen concentration can be a valuable source of information. For the advancement of precision agriculture and the preservation of the natural ecological environment, an accurate, quick, and low-cost determination of soil nitrogen content and its variations is essential. This paper systematically analyzes and summarizes soil nitrogen detection methods by compiling and analyzing the relevant literature, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, and concluding with a discussion of the most significant challenges and future research trends in this field. This study provides a helpful resource for understanding the current status, application constraints, and future developments of nitrogen-sensing technologies in precision agriculture.

TI  - Best crop rotation selection with gis-ahp technique using soil nutrient variability
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop selections and rotations are very important in optimising land and labour productivities, enhancing higher cropping intensities, producing better crop yield. A land suitability analysis system based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique coupled with the Geographic Information System (GIS) software environment can be a unique tool for better crop selection. The AHP-GIS technique was used in land suitability analysis in crop rotation decisions, for rice-jute (Kharif season) and potato-lentil (Rabi season) crops in the Hooghly District, West Bengal, India. The study area covering 291 ha was classified based on eight major soil nutrient levels with 70 randomly selected plots for soil sampling and analysis. The soil nutrient variability was examined with descriptive statistics followed by best semivariogram-based model selection for kriging interpolation in the â€˜Râ€™ software environment. The pairwise comparison matrix based ranking of parameters and giving weights was carried out considering the importance of each parameter for specific crops. The total area, being under the major rice-potato belt, could be classified from the suitability view point to the â€˜highly suitableâ€™(S1) class occupying 29.2\%, and â€˜not suitableâ€™ (N) class; 4.5\% for rice, about 6.5\% of land is â€˜highly suitableâ€™ (S1), â€˜and nearly 2.1\% area is â€˜not suitableâ€™ (N) for jute; and 21.3\% is â€˜highly suitableâ€™ (S1) for potato and 12.4\% for lentil crops. The yield maps showed nearly 75\% and 90\% of the area for rice and potato crops, respectively, gave sound crop yield. Furthermore, the GIS platform was used for crop rotation analysis to spread multiple seasons ensuring better crop management in long run. Overall, 25\% of the rice crop area for jute in Kharif and 8\% of potato crop area for lentil in the Rabi season were recommended as replacements. Â© 2020 by the authors.

VL  - 72
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of low-cost embedded devices with ubiquitous connectivity systems is a possible strategy to monitor the consumption of water used in agriculture even in countries that do not have good economic resources. In this article, we propose a low-cost system based on a measuring approach of capacitive soil water content (SWC) sensors never explored previously. This solution takes advantage of the sensor properties to respond to the need to measure at the same time salinity and soil volumetric water content. For this purpose, a bifunctional system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated circuit (IC) is described. The considered frequency range for impedance measurements is 10-100 kHz, which is a 'low-frequency' range compared with typical operating frequencies of professional systems devoted to water content measurements. Measurements are carried out to check the system accuracy and to characterize the impedance of the sensor both in the air and in water, which represent the two boundaries of possible operating conditions in physical soils in terms of the real part of the electrical permittivity. Variations of the imaginary part of the electrical permittivity are taken into account using water with conductivity between 1 and 2300 Î¼S /cm. Experimental results are compared with the measurements obtained by using a laboratory inductance in honor of Heinrich Lenz, capacitance and resistance (LCR) meter, and a maximum error of +6.12\% for the capacitance and +5.6\% for the conductance is obtained. The proposed system is also employed to characterize silica sandy soil with different water contents and conductivities showing quite promising results useful to overcome the well-known limits of low-cost SWC sensors.

TI  - On the potential of {Sentinel}-1 for sub-field scale soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 120
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) datasets at high spatial resolutions are beneficial for a wide range of applications, such as monitoring and prediction of hydrological extremes, numerical weather prediction, and precision agriculture. For large scale applications in particular, remotely sensed SM has advantages over in situ data because it provides gridded estimates and because it is less labour-intensive. However, until present, active microwave SM data have not been presented at their native spatial resolution, since the quality of these data is limited by speckle. We explored the potential and limits of high spatial resolution of active microwave SM observations. We used a Sentinel-1 C-band SAR SM dataset at six spatial resolutions ranging from 20 Ã— 20 to 120 Ã— 120 m2. This was compared to a closely spaced (20 m) in situ dataset collected on a non-irrigated agricultural field (Â±2.5 ha) in the Southeast of Luxembourg. A comparison of the field and satellite datasets demonstrated how Sentinel-1 data with a high spatial resolution can be used to quantify temporal within-field SM variability. SM was accurately estimated at spatial resolutions of 60 Ã— 60 m2 and coarser, where the temporal correlation was found to be 0.67 and sub-field variations in SM were still detected. Spatial correlation was limited by the absence of SM variability within the field. These results indicate that high spatial resolution SM estimates from Sentinel-1 data can be valuable for monitoring temporal SM variations within agricultural fields.

TI  - An improved global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture ({RSSSM}) dataset covering 2003-2018
VL  - 13
SN  - 1866-3508
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable linking the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. However, long-term satellite monitoring of surface soil moisture at the global scale needs improvement. In this study, we conducted data calibration and data fusion of 11 well-acknowledged microwave remote-sensing soil moisture products since 2003 through a neural network approach, with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data applied as the primary training target. The training efficiency was high (R-2 = 0.95) due to the selection of nine quality impact factors of microwave soil moisture products and the complicated organizational structure of multiple neural networks (five rounds of iterative simulations, eight substeps, 67 independent neural networks, and more than 1 million localized subnetworks). Then, we developed the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) covering 2003-2018 at 0.1 degrees resolution. The temporal resolution is approximately 10 d, meaning that three data records are obtained within a month, for days 1-10, 11-20, and from the 21st to the last day of that month. RSSSM is proven comparable to the in situ surface soil moisture measurements of the International Soil Moisture Network sites (overall R-2 and RMSE values of 0.42 and 0.087 m(3)m(-3)), while the overall R-2 and RMSE values for the existing popular similar products are usually within the ranges of 0.31-0.41 and 0.095-0.142 m(3)m(-3)), respectively. RSSSM generally presents advantages over other products in arid and relatively cold areas, which is probably because of the difficulty in simulating the impacts of thawing and transient precipitation on soil moisture, and during the growing seasons. Moreover, the persistent high quality during 2003-2018 as well as the complete spatial coverage ensure the applicability of RSSSM to studies on both the spatial and temporal patterns (e.g. long-term trend). RSSSM data suggest an increase in the global mean surface soil moisture. Moreover, without considering the deserts and rainforests, the surface soil moisture loss on consecutive rainless days is highest in summer over the low latitudes (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) but mostly in winter over the mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees N, 30-60 degrees S). Notably, the error propagation is well controlled with the extension of the simulation period to the past, indicating that the data fusion algorithm proposed here will be more meaningful in the future when more advanced microwave sensors become operational. RSSSM data can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.912597 (Chen, 2020).

VL  - 14
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - The soil moisture changes (\${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$) have a significant influence on forestry, hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and climate change. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), as a potential remote sensing tool for change detection, was relatively less investigated for monitoring this parameter. DInSAR phase (\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$) is sensitive to the changes in soil moisture (\$\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$), and thus, can be potentially used for monitoring \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$. In this article, the relations between \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ over wheat, canola, corn, soybean, weed, peas, and bare fields were investigated using an empirical regression technique. To this end, dual-polarimetric C-band Sentinel-1A and quad-polarimetric L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne datasets were employed. The regression model showed the coefficient of determination (R2) of 40\% to 56\% and RMSE of 4.3 vol.\% to 6.1 vol.\% between the measured and estimated \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ for different crop types when the temporal baseline (\${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$) was very short. As expected, higher accuracies were obtained using UAVSAR given its very short \${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$ and its longer wavelength with R2 of 47\% to 59\% and RMSE of 4.1 vol.\% to 6.7 vol.\% for different crop types. However, using the Sentinel-1 data with the long \${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$ and shorter wavelength (5.6 cm), the accuracies of \$\{\{{\textbackslash}bf {\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ estimations decreased significantly. The results of this study demonstrated that using the \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$ information from Sentinel-1 data is a promising approach for monitoring \$\{\{{\textbackslash}bf {\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ at an early growing season or before the crop starts growing, but using L-band SAR data and lower temporal baselines are recommended once the biomass increases.

VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - P-band Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) has great potential for remote sensing of root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from space. We have carried out a tower-based experiment with receivers to detect the reflected signals from the communications satellites at the Fraser Experimental Forests (FEFs), Colorado, in 2017. The measured reflectivity data at 260 MHz have a good correlation with in-soil moisture (SM) measurements. Retrieval of SM from the reflectivity data was also performed with results indicating accuracy of about 0.01 bias and 0.02 standard deviation (std) with respect to the average of SM in the upper 10 cm of soil. The experimental data and retrieval analyses lend support to the use of P-band SoOp for the remote sensing of SM. Our data also indicate the limitation of single frequency observations, suggesting the requirement of multiple frequencies to enable RZSM remote sensing because the surface SM plays a critical role on the change of reflectivity even at P-band frequencies.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval from remote sensing measurements: {Current} knowledge and directions for the future
VL  - 218
SN  - 0012-8252
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an essential parameter for understanding the interactions and feedbacks between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface through energy and water cycles. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of land surface SM has long been a challenge in the remote sensing community. Over the past 50 years, electromagnetic spectra, from the optical/thermal to the microwave regions, have been intensively investigated for SM retrieval, providing a number of algorithms, models and products that are available for actual applications nowadays. However, certain issues with respect to retrieval accuracy, spatiotemporal resolution, and data consistency exist and remain unsolved between the state-of-the-art of SM retrieval and readily-used SM datasets for various domains at field, regional/watershed or global scales. In particular, several new theories and algorithms for SM retrieval proposed in recent years have not been well documented in previous articles. Therefore, a critical review of the established and emerging SM retrieval methods with respect to their advantages and disadvantages is necessary. In present study, future directions for each method are highlighted to address the scientific challenges of SM retrieval in the new era of rapid data expansion.

VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - The primary objective of this work was the utilization of the pulsed acoustic wave (PAW) method to explore the feasibility of measuring soil water content (SWC) based on the soil acoustic parameter acquisition (SAPA) system. Acoustic parameters (pulse acoustic velocity and acoustic attenuation coefficient) were collected from paddy soil (clay), red soil (loam), and lateritic-red soil (clay loam) under different SWCs. The calibration models of the pulse acoustic velocity, the attenuation coefficient, and the double acoustic parameters with the soil volumetric water content (SVWC) were established through fitting analysis. We studied the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration models and conducted an extensive field experiment for 40 days to evaluate the calibration model's ability to predict SVWC. The results showed that the repeatability and reproducibility of the SVWC calibration model based on pulse acoustic velocity were the best, which showed that the acoustic velocity was more suitable for the inversion of SVWC than the acoustic attenuation coefficient. The 40-day field study's experimental results also verified the potential value of pulse acoustic velocity in SVWC detection. Â© 2013 IEEE.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The water cycle around the globe is significantly impacted by the moisture in the soil. However, finding a quick and practical model to cope with the enormous amount of data is a difficult issue for remote sensing practitioners. The traditional methods of measuring soil moisture are inefficient at large sizes, which can be replaced by remote sensing techniques for obtaining soil moisture. While determining the soil moisture, the low return frequency of satellites and the lack of images pose a severe challenge to the current remote sensing techniques. Therefore, this paper suggested a novel technique for Soil Moisture Retrieval. In the initial phase, image acquisition is made. Then, VI indexes (NDVI, GLAI, Green NDVI (GNDVI), and WDRVI features) are derived. Further, an improved Water Cloud Model (WCM) is deployed as a vegetation impact rectification scheme. Finally, soil moisture retrieval is determined by the hybrid model combining Deep Max Out Network (DMN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) schemes, whose outputs are then passed on to enhanced score level fusion that offers final results. According to the results, the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier (Bi-GRU and DMN) method was lower (0.9565) than the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier methods. The ME values of the HC (Bi-GRU and DMN) were also lower (0.728697) than those of the HC methods without the vegetation index, the HC methods without the presence of water clouds, and the HC methods with traditional water clouds. In comparison to HC (Bi-GRU and DMN), the HC method without vegetation index has a lower error of 0.8219 than the HC method with standard water cloud and the HC method without water cloud.

VL  - 13
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry (SoOp-R) is a maturing field for geophysical remote sensing as evidenced by the growing number of airborne and spaceborne experiments. As this approach receives more attention, it is worth analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve subsurface soil moisture (SM) by leveraging communication and navigation satellite transmitters. In this research, the Cramerâ€“Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on the best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and incidence angle measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric profile. The results also detail the effects of variable SM conditions on the capability of SoOp-R systems to predict subsurface SM. The most prevalent observation is the importance of using at least two frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM estimates. If at least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is retrievable within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as the number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30Â cm, it is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy is achievable with as few as two dual-frequency-based SoOp-R measurements. For this depth, increasing number of measurements provided by polarization and incidence angle allow for sensing of increasingly wet SM profile structures. This study, overall, details a methodology by which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to achieve a desired CRLB using a tradeoff study between the available measurements and SM profile.

TI  - Soil moisture by remote sensing retrieval in the tropic of cancer of yunnan province
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a direct source of water for terrestrial plants. Measurement of soil moisture can help to characterize plant growth and portray regional soil moisture information in a timely manner, which is of great significance for water and soil regulation. This study uses the Tropic of Cancer in Yunnan Province as a research area, and based on MODIS product data, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI), vegetation supply water index (VSWI) and surface water capacity index (SWCI) are calculated. The measured data are used in regression analysis modeling to retrieve the soil moisture in the study area. The results show that the three indices of ATI, SWCI and VSWI have good correlation with soil moisture, among which VSWI has the best fitting effect, and ATI and SWCI can retrieve soil moisture more effectively. The soil moisture contents are mostly concentrated in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 m3/m3, among which the soil moisture of Jianshui County, Mengzi City, Wenshan County, Yanshan County, Gejiu City and Shiping County are the smallest, and the soil moisture in the western portion of Gengma County and Cangyuan County and the central portion of Jinggu County are the largest. As the fractional vegetation cover increases, the soil moisture content also gradually increases, and the mean value is greater than 0.2 m3/m3. Â© 2020, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing interest in studying the variability of soil water content and its spatial scale dependency necessitates the development of new techniques to accurately monitor soil water over a wide range of spatial scales. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m3 mâˆ’3 using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions. Â© 2022.

VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Recently, 2-frame interdigital fringe-field (ID-FF)-based capacitive sensors have been widely employed for soil moisture measurement. The present challenge with this design is to achieve both penetration depth and sensitivity simultaneously. In this work, keeping the electrode contour area fixed, multi-frame ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensors are proposed and designed to enhance sensitivity and penetration depth, simultaneously. A theoretical model for capacitance is extended to a multi-frame configuration. The estimated capacitance from this extended theoretical model is compared against simulation results and found to be well-correlated. Multi-frame ID-FF configurations with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 frames are used to develop single-sided (s-s) and dual-sided (d-s) ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensor models. Simulation results show an increase in the sensitivity and penetration depth with reference to the generic 2-frame ID-FF capacitive sensor configuration. The models with distinct multi-frame configurations and an associated signal-conditioning circuit are also fabricated. Experiments for sensitivity indicate an average error of less than 6\% with reference to simulation, which is lower than that reported in the recent literature. One of the fabricated sensors is calibrated using the thermogravimetric method. The performance of the fabricated sensors is then compared with a standard commercial sensor with respect to the thermogravimetric method and is found to meet the expected requirements with a correlation coefficient of 0.997.

TI  - Soil structure and texture effects on the precision of soil water content measurements with a capacitance-based electromagnetic sensor
VL  - 63
SN  - NA
AB  - The physical properties of soil, such as structure and texture, can affect the performance of an electromagnetic sensor in measuring soil water content. Historically, calibrations have been performed on repacked samples in the laboratory and on in situ soils in the field, but little research has been done on laboratory calibrations with intact (undisturbed) soil cores. In this study, three replications each of disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from two soil texture classes (Yutan silty clay loam and Fillmore silt loam) at a field site in eastern Nebraska to investigate the effects of soil structure and texture on the precision of a METER Group GS-1 capacitance-based sensor calibration. In addition, GS-1 sensors were installed in the field near the soil collection sites at three depths (0.15, 0.46, and 0.76 m). The soil moisture sensor had higher precision in the undisturbed laboratory setup, as the undisturbed calibration had a better correlation [slope closer to one, R2 undisturbed (0.89) {\textgreater} R2 disturbed (0.73)] than the disturbed calibrations for the Yutan and Fillmore texture classes, and the root mean square difference using the laboratory calibration (RMSDL) was higher for pooled disturbed samples (0.053 m3 m-3) in comparison to pooled undisturbed samples (0.023 m3 m-3). The uncertainty in determination of volumetric water content (Î¸vv) was higher using the factory calibration (RMSDF) in comparison to the laboratory calibration (RMSDL) for the different soil structures and texture classes. In general, the uncertainty in estimation of soil water depth was greater than the uncertainty in estimation of soil water depletion by the sensors installed in the field, and the uncertainties in estimation of depth and depletion were lower using the calibration developed from the undisturbed soil samples. The undisturbed calibration of soil water depletion would determine water demand with better precision and potentially avoid over-watering, offering relief from water shortages. Further investigation of sensor calibration techniques is required to enhance the applicability of soil moisture sensors for efficient irrigation management.

AB  - Agricultural drought is triggered by a depletion of moisture content in the soil, which hinders photosynthesis and thus increases carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation activity toward quantifying CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. To this end, the MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), an optical multispectral sensor, was used to evaluate two regions in South Korea for validation. Vegetation activity was analyzed through MOD13A1 vegetation indices products, and MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP) product was used to calculate the CO2 flux based on its relationship with respiration. In the case of SM, it was calculated through the method of applying apparent thermal inertia (ATI) in combination with land surface temperature and albedo. To validate the SM and CO2 flux, flux tower data was used which are the observed measurement values for the extreme drought period of 2014 and 2015 in South Korea. These two variables were analyzed for temporal variation on flux tower data as daily time scale, and the relationship with vegetation index (VI) was synthesized and analyzed on a monthly scale. The highest correlation between SM and VI (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.82) was observed at a time lag of one month, and that between VI and CO2 (r = 0.81) at half month. This regional study suggests a potential capability of MODIS-based SM, VI, and CO2 flux, which can be applied to an assessment of the global view of the agricultural drought by using available satellite remote sensing products.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - The measurement of soil moisture and air humidity is essential to many technological and environmental applications. Sensors provide information that is useful in order to effectively manage and control various processes. This study presents an energy-efficient, highly reliable, ultra-high frequency (UHF) capacitive sensor that can measure moisture/humidity, and liquid levels. As a sensitive part, an interdigital capacitor (IDC) is fed via a coplanar waveguide (CPW) for efficient power transfer. Aside from the sensitive part of the IDC, the structure of the sensor is insensitive to variations in surrounding permittivity, which reduces uncertainty in results and thus improves accuracy. The principle of sensing is based on a reactive phase variation of the input signal upon reflection, whereas its amplitude and phase are actively changing with variations in the dielectric constant of the test medium. Practical testing was conducted on the sensor to determine soil moisture, air humidity, and liquid level measurement. At a fixed UHF frequency of 915 MHz the sensor offers a capacitive sensitivity of 7.5 fF/\%WC, 4.5 fF/\%RH, and 13.4 fF/mm for soil moisture, air humidity, and water level detection respectively. This new sensor provides high reliability, good sensitivity, low power consumption, and can be implemented in a number of applications, including agriculture, oil, and gas industry, land and water treatment, medical equipment, and biotechnology.

TI  - Application of the vineyard data assimilation ({VIDA}) system to vineyard root-zone soil moisture monitoring in the {California} {Central} {Valley
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Efforts to apply gridded root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) products for irrigation decision-support in vineyards are currently hampered by the difficulty of obtaining RZSM products that meet required accuracy, resolution, and data latency requirements. In particular, the operational application of soil water balance modeling is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining accurate irrigation inputs and representing complex sub-surface water-flow processes within vineyards. Here, we discuss prospects for addressing these shortcomings using the Vineyard Data Assimilation (VIDA) system based on the assimilation of high-resolution (30-m) soil moisture information obtained from synthetic aperture radar and thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing into a one-dimensional soil water balance model. The VIDA system is tested retrospectively (2017â€“2020) for two vineyard sites in the California Central Valley that have been instrumented as part of the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). Results demonstrate that VIDA can generally capture daily temporal variations in RZSM for vertical depths of 30â€“60 cm beneath the vine row, and the assimilation of remote sensing products is shown to produce modest improvement in the temporal accuracy of VIDA RZSM estimates. However, results also reveal shortcomings in the ability of VIDA to correct biases in assumed irrigation applicationsâ€”particularly during well-watered portions of the growing season when TIR-based evapotranspiration observations are not moisture limited and, therefore, decoupled from RZSM. Prospects for addressing these limitations and plans for the near-real-time operational application of the VIDA system are discussed.

TI  - Advancements in dielectric soil moisture sensor {Calibration}: {A} comprehensive review of methods and techniques
VL  - 218
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable for real-time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time-intensive procedures. In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number of in-situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture, these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration method based on the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted in this review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional equations based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as the nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable data is also emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for selecting the appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture sensors to achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management. Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil Fertility is one of the most relevant fields of Soil Science related to agricultural production, especially in tropical and subtropical environments, due to the prevalence of weathered and naturally unproductive soils. However, indicators of Soil Fertility currently used do not represent what actual happens in the soil; once must be understood as a process. The wisdom of this importance occurred in Antiquity and evolved until the mid-19th century, when the mineralist concept was proposed, which is still dominant in Brazil and worldwide. In this process, Soil Fertility has been associated with current perceptions, soil chemical properties and management systems in the development of agriculture over time. During the evolution of Brazilian agriculture, from the 1960â€™s onwards and most notable with the consolidation of conservation management in the 1990â€™s, Intrinsic limitations were increasingly evident on the ability of indicators to assess the actual level of Soil Fertility and the respective response of the plants. Concurrently, the view of the soil as an open system was strengthened, and the conception of fertility began to constitute a property that emerges from the functioning of the soil, whose processes are self-organizing, due to the continuous flows of energy and matter driven by organic compounds. In this context, we present a part of the history of Brazilian agriculture, relating it to its management and Intrinsic limitations of indicators to assess Soil Fertility due to changes in soil functioning. The Intrinsic limitations added to understanding based on a systemic approach of the functional processes of the soil are the practical and theoretical bases for the proposition of another concept: Systemic Soil Fertility.

AB  - Soil water content is a critical environmental parameter in research and practice, though various technological and contextual constraints limit its estimation in arid areas with vegetation cover. This study combined the multitemporal remote sensing data of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 to conduct an inversion study on surface soil water content under low vegetation cover in Nagqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Four vegetation indices (NDVI, ARVI, EVI, and RVI) were extracted from optical remote sensing data. A water cloud model was used to eliminate the influence of the vegetation layer on the backscattering coefficient associated with vegetation cover, and a predictive model suitable for the Nagqu area was constructed. The water cloud model effectively incorporated a vegetation index instead of vegetation water content. We found that VV polarization was more suitable for soil water content inversion than VH polarization. Among the four vegetation indices, the soil water content inversion model constructed with RVI under VV polarization had the best fit (R-2 = 0.8212; RMSE = 6.30). The second-best fit was observed for vegetation water content-NDVI (R-2 = 0.8201). The soil water content inversion models all had an R-2 {\textgreater} 0.6, regardless of the vegetation index used, though the RVI had the best fitting effect, indicating that this vegetation index is highly applicable in the water cloud model, as a substitute for vegetation water content, and is expected to perform well in similar study sites.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - To explore soil nutrients and moisture changes in different karst mountain agroforestry, in the plateau mountains of Southern China Karst, we used secondary tree and irrigation forest (C) as a reference for our study and selected four mixed agroforestry species (walnut + maize + potato (HYM), walnut + maize (HTY), poplar + ryegrass (YSH), and maize + ryegrass (YMH)) for comparison. First, soil moisture change characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed, soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1) during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation range was more than 5\%; (2) the changes of soil water content were significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability, the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM 0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at 2â€“3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv value between winter and summer exceeded 21\%. The results provide basic theoretical support for further exploring the relationship among agroforestry, soil, moisture, and nutrients and enrich the content of the development of agroforestry in karst areas. They are of importance to promote ecological restoration and agroforestry development in karst areas. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A novel approach to interpret soil moisture content for economical monitoring of urban landscape
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Preservation of green infrastructure (GI) needs continuous monitoring of soil moisture. Moisture content in soil is generally interpreted on the basis electrical conductivity (EC), soil temperature and relative humidity (RH). However, validity of previous approaches to interpret moisture content in urban landscape was rarely investigated. There is a need to relate the moisture content with other parameters (EC, temperature and RH) to economize the sensor installation. This study aims to quantify the dynamics of the above-mentioned parameters in an urban green space, and to further develop correlations between moisture content and other parameters (EC, temperature and RH). An integrated field monitoring and statistical modelling approach were adopted to achieve the objective. Four distinct sites comprising treed (younger and mature tree), grassed and bare soil were selected for investigation. Field monitoring was conducted for two months to measure four parameters. This was followed by statistical modelling by artificial neural networks (ANN). Correlations were developed for estimating soil moisture as a function of other parameters for the selected sites. Irrespective of the type of site, EC was found to be the most significant parameter affecting soil moisture, followed by RH and soil temperature. This correlation with EC is found to be stronger in vegetated soil as compared to that without vegetation. The correlations of soil temperature with water content do not have a conclusive trend. A considerable increase in temperature was not found due to the subsequent drying of soil after rainfall. A normal distribution function was found from the uncertainty analysis of soil moisture in the case of treed soil, whereas soil moisture was observed to follow a skewed distribution in the bare and grassed soils.

TI  - Quantification of irrigation water using remote sensing of soil moisture in a semi-arid region
VL  - 231
SN  - NA
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of fresh water resources. Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012â€“2015 are used as the input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in Iran for which actual irrigation data is available. The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and 12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with improvement in order of 11\% and 42\% in R and RMSE depending on the inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates. The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. 50 km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Optical remote sensing (about 0.4âˆ¼2.0 mu m) indexes of soil moisture (SM) are valuable for some specific applications such as monitoring agricultural drought and downscaling microwave SM, due to their abundant data sources, higher spatial resolution, and easy-to-use features, etc. In this study, we evaluated thirteen typical optical SM indexes with aircraft and in situ observed SM from two field campaigns, the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) and 2016 (SMAPVEX16) conducted in Manitoba, Canada. MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imager Level-1C data were utilized to calculate the optical SM indexes. The evaluation results demonstrated that (1) the Visible and Shortwave Infrared Drought Index (VSDI) and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) outperform the other eleven optical SM indexes as compared with aircraft and in situ observed SM. They also presented well consistence in temporal variation with the in situ observed SM. (2) The VSDI achieved comparable performance with the OPTRAM while the former has very simple calculation expression and the latter requires complex process to determine the dry and wet boundaries. (3) Both the VSDI and OPTRAM utilize two sensitive bands of soil and vegetation moisture, i.e., Red and SWIR bands, whereas the other eleven SM indexes only employ one sensitive band. This may be the main reason of the evaluation results. (4) Based on this recognition, improvements of the VSDI and OPTRAM were created and validated in this study through adding more sensitive band to VSDI and combining NDVI and modified VSDI into a new feature space for calculating the optical SM index as with OPTRAM. The results are conducive to selecting and utilizing the current numerous optical SM indexes for SM and drought monitoring.

TI  - Agronomic use of solarization technology on soil fertility and pest management in dryland agriculture
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop production in dryland agriculture is challenged by weed infestation, and soil borne diseases which are sever in poorly fertile and moisture deficit soils where pathogen spores and weed seeds endure and persist for several years. There is little knowledge and organized information about the impact of solarization technology on soil fertility, beneficial soil microorganisms, greenhouse gas emission and its economic feasibility in dryland agriculture. This paper aimed to review the role of soil solarization as pest control mechanisms, its effect on soil biota and soil fertility in dryland. Data and information were gathered, synthesized and paraphrased from relevant and peer reviewed published papers. Studies showed that soil solarization increases the total population of soil microorganisms by 477 (no.gâˆ’1soil) and improves soil fertility by 16\%, reduce weed infestations and soil borne diseases by 90 and 80\% respectively in drylands, thereby it gives a yield advantage of 17.42 t haâˆ’1 than unsalaried soil. Solarization is economically profitable and gives a return investment of 56\% per year. It is more sounding with prior irrigation and biodegradable plastic films during hot seasons of dryland areas. This technology is safe, affordable, effective and sustainable crop protection and soil fertility enhancing strategy. Â© 2024 The Author(s).

TI  - Comparison of microwave remote sensing and land surface modeling for surface soil moisture climatology estimation
VL  - 242
SN  - NA
AB  - Climatology (mean seasonal cycle) errors often cause large differences between soil moisture products. However, relatively little work has been done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle (SMC) information acquired from different sources. This study evaluates surface (0â€“10 cm) SMCs obtained from four land surface models (LSMs), two C/X-band and two L-band remote-sensing (RS) products using 5 dense networks and 75 sparse in-situ soil moisture measurement sites located within the contiguous United States. Results show that relative to older C/X-band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), newer L-band products derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean and Salinity (SMOS) mission provide more accurate SMC estimates (with an average of 35\% root-mean-square-error reduction). In fact, the latest SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product provides SMC intra-seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 3â€“34\% and 2â€“37\% more accurate, respectively, than all four LSM-based SMCs examined here. Hence, SMC validation against SMOS-IC SMC results may improve LSMs' ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics, and the common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM SMC estimates is likely sub-optimal for assimilating L-band soil moisture retrievals. Although the SMOS-IC product has made significant progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values, a temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS-IC surface SMCs over all land cover types. Addressing this bias should be a priority for future generations of SMOS retrieval algorithms. Â© 2020

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture in drip-irrigated citrus orchards using multi-modal {UAV} remote sensing
VL  - 302
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate and timely prediction of soil moisture in orchards is crucial for making informed irrigation decisions at a regional scale. Conventional methods for monitoring soil moisture are often limited by high cost and disruption of soil structure, etc. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, with high spatial and temporal resolutions, offers an effective alternative for monitoring regional soil moisture. In this study, multi-modal UAV remote sensing data, including RGB, thermal infrared (TIR), and multi-spectral (Mul) data, were acquired in citrus orchards. The correlations between different sensor data and soil moisture were analyzed to construct seven input combinations. Convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) models and a new hybrid model (CNN-LSTM), were employed to predict soil moisture at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm. Additionally, the impact of standalone sensor, texture features and multi-sensor data fusion on the accuracy of soil moisture prediction was explored. The results indicated that the model with RGB + Mul + TIR achieved the highest prediction accuracy, followed by those with Mul + TIR and RGB + Mul, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.80â€“0.88, 0.64â€“0.84, and 0.60â€“0.81, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 2.46â€“2.99 m3Â·mâˆ’3, 2.86â€“3.89 m3Â·mâˆ’3 and 3.15â€“4.25 m3Â·mâˆ’3, respectively. Among single sensor inputs, the Mul sensor data has the highest prediction accuracy, followed by TIR and RGB sensor, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.54â€“0.72, 0.36â€“0.52 and 0.14â€“0.26, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 3.72â€“4.58 \%, 3.81â€“5.04 \% and 4.27â€“6.21 \%, respectively. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy, followed by CNN and LSTM models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.20â€“0.88, 0.16â€“0.83, and 0.14â€“0.81, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 2.46â€“5.01 m3Â·mâˆ’3, 2.68â€“5.35 m3Â·mâˆ’3 and 2.81â€“6.21 m3Â·mâˆ’3, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the models was the highest at the depth of 5 cm, followed by 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm, with the coefficient of determination (R2) average of 0.63, 0.62, 0.59, and 0.55, and root mean square error (RMSE) average of 3.70 m3Â·mâˆ’3, 3.79 m3Â·mâˆ’3, 3.85 m3Â·mâˆ’3 and 4.21 m3Â·mâˆ’3, respectively. Therefore, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model with RGB + Mul + TIR is recommended to predict soil moisture in citrus orchard. It provides method and data support for regional precision irrigation decision-making. Â© 2024 The Authors

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Drone multispectral technology enables the real-time monitoring and analysis of soil moisture across vast agricultural lands. overcoming the time-consuming, labor-intensive, and spatial discontinuity constraints of traditional methods. This study establishes a rapid inversion model for deep soil moisture (0â€“200 cm) in dryland agriculture using data from drone-based multispectral remote sensing. Maize, millet, sorghum, and potatoes were selected for this study, with multispectral data, canopy leaf, and soil moisture content at various depths collected every 3 to 6 days. Vegetation indices highly correlated with crop canopy leaf moisture content (p {\textless} 0.01) and were identified using Pearson correlation analysis, leading to the development of linear and nonlinear regression models for predicting moisture content in canopy leaves and soil. The results show a significant linear correlation between the predicted and actual canopy leaf moisture levels for the four crops, according to the chosen vegetation indices. The use of canopy leaf moisture content to predict surface soil moisture (0â€“20 cm) demonstrated enhanced accuracy. The models designed for the top 20 cm of soil moisture successfully estimated deep soil moisture levels (up to 200 cm) for all four crops. The 20 cm range soil moisture model showed improvements over the 10 cm range model, with increases in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), and Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) by 0.4, 0.8, 0.73, and 0.34, respectively, in the corn area; 0.28, 0.69, 0.48, and 0.25 in the millet area; 0.4, 0.48, 0.22, and 0.52 in the sorghum area; and 1.14, 0.81, 0.73, and 0.56 in the potato area, all with an average Relative Error (RE) of less than 10\% across the crops. Using drone-based multispectral technology, this study forecasts leaf water content via vegetation index analysis, facilitating swift and effective soil moisture inversion. This research introduces a novel method for monitoring and managing agricultural water resources, providing a scientific basis for precision farming and moisture variation monitoring in dryland areas.

TI  - Study on a single interpolation fusion algorithm for multisource remote sensing data of soil moisture
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture can provide important data for monitoring large-scale agricultural drought. Due to differences between the various sensors and inversion methods, remote sensing data from different sources are unsuitable for direct comparison and analysis. Data fusion has become an area of active research regarding the application of remote sensing data. Based on the principle of cumulative distribution function matching, this study proposed a continuous relationship establishment algorithm for multisource remote sensing soil moisture data. Using this new algorithm, soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Climate Change Initiative (CCI) satellite data from the Songnen Plain as test data were fused to a long time series product of real-time remote sensing soil moisture data. This application validation of this new method to SMOS and CCI indicated that this Lagrange interpolation continuous fusion algorithm could improve the fusion accuracy of multisource remote sensing soil moisture data significantly. The low-value region of the cumulative probability distribution curve is a crucial data segment for characterization of agricultural drought. Through implementation of the proposed continuous fusion algorithm, fused SMOS and CCI data were found to have high coincidence at each quantile in the low-value region of the curve.

TI  - A change in perspective: {Downhole} cosmic-ray neutron sensing for the estimation of soil moisture
VL  - 27
SN  - NA
AB  - Above-ground cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for the non-invasive estimation of the field-scale soil moisture content in the upper decimetres of the soil. However, large parts of the deeper vadose zone remain outside of its observational window. Retrieving soil moisture information from these deeper layers requires extrapolation, modelling or other methods, all of which come with methodological challenges. Against this background, we investigate CRNS for downhole soil moisture measurements in deeper layers of the vadose zone. To render calibration with in situ soil moisture measurements unnecessary, we rescaled neutron intensities observed below the terrain surface with intensities measured above a waterbody. An experimental set-up with a CRNS sensor deployed at different depths of up to 10gm below the surface in a groundwater observation well combined with particle transport simulations revealed the response of downhole thermal neutron intensities to changes in the soil moisture content at the depth of the downhole neutron detector as well as in the layers above it. The simulation results suggest that the sensitive measurement radius of several decimetres, which depends on soil moisture and soil bulk density, exceeds that of a standard active neutron probe (which is only about 30gcm). We derived transfer functions to estimate downhole neutron signals from soil moisture information, and we describe approaches for using these transfer functions in an inverse way to derive soil moisture from the observed neutron signals. The in situ neutron and soil moisture observations confirm the applicability of these functions and prove the concept of passive downhole soil moisture estimation, even at larger depths, using cosmic-ray neutron sensing.

TI  - Performance of multi-source remote sensing soil moisture products over {Punjab} {Pakistan} during 2022-2023
VL  - 155
SN  - 0177-798X
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a valuable tool for terrestrial remote sensing applications, particularly in the context of land Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) detection. The high-resolution capability of GNSS-R complements traditional satellite-based active and passive missions but the product reliability and robustness evaluations are still absent due to an efficient retrieval algorithms. In this study, we addressed this lack of reliability and robustness by comprehensively assessing the SSM retrievals from CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data with the satellite-based microwave radiometry products Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) over Punjab in various seasons. ERA5 model-based products for the same period in 2022-2023. Our study reveals a distinct seasonal average SSM variation during autumn (0.20 cm3/cm3), followed by winter values of 0.19 cm3/cm3. Subsequently, the minimum SSM values are observed during summer (0.11 cm3/cm3) and an increase in spring to 0.13 cm3/cm3. Moreover, a strong positive linear relationship (0.74) is evident between SMAP and ERRA 5 in contrast to a low correlation (0.03) between MERRA2 and both the SMAP and ERRA 5. Additionally, SMAP demonstrates moderate and weak correlation of 0.53 and 0.03 with CYGNSS and MERRA2, respectively. The CYGNSS exhibits moderate correlations (0.46) with ERRA 5 and SMAP and a weaker association (0.14) with MERRA2. Our analysis concluded that MERRA2 (Bias = 0.20 cm(3)/cm(3), ubRMSD = 0.25 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSE = 0.12 cm(3)/cm(3), SD = 0.13 cm(3)/cm(3), MAE = 0.04 cm(3)/cm, R = 0.03) SSM product performs poorly as compared to SMAP (Bias = 0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), ubRMSD = 0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSE = 0.04 cm(3)/cm(3), SD = 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), MAE = 0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), R = 0.74) and CYGNSS (Bias = -0.01 cm(3)/cm(3), ubRMSD = 0.09 cm(3)/cm(3), RMSE = 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3), SD = 0.06 cm(3)/cm(3), MAE = 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3), R = 0.46) products. This study provides accurate future predictions of SSM with delineating the limitations of GNSS-R in comparison to remote sensing and model values. The findings from this study have also significant implications for the advancement of GNSS-R applications in agriculture and crop management.

AB  - Reliable soil moisture information is vital for optimal irrigation management, farm-level agronomic decision-making, hydrologic studies, and cropping systems modeling. A wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies is commercially available, but their performance must be evaluated for diverse conditions of use. In this research, we investigated nine soil moisture sensors based on time-domain reflectometry, capacitance, and electrical resistance principles in production field conditions with two installation orientations, i.e., vertical (V) and horizontal (H), in two soils (silt loam and loamy sand) and two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Performance parameters deduced from the 2017 datasets revealed that sensor type and soil type significantly affected the soil moisture sensor performance under factory calibration (F.C.); however, sensor installation orientation did not. Thus, the sensors were only evaluated based on their performance in horizontal orientation in both soils. Precision and accuracy were considered targets to assist in appropriate sensor selection. To improve sensor accuracy, site-specific calibration (S.S.C.) functions were developed and validated using independent datasets from 2018. Considering mean bias error (MBE), all sensors overestimated volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) in both soils, with the exception of TEROS 21 (MPS-6) in silt loam and JD probe in loamy sand. On average, sensor performance was 67\% better in loamy sand than in silt loam. Overall, the sensors showed higher precision in silt loam (R-2 = 0.53 to 0.93) than in loamy sand (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.82). Substantial post-S.S.C. improvement (32\% to 89\%) was observed in all sensors' performance relative to F.C. in silt loam. In loamy sand, while most sensors performed reasonably well with F.C., considerable improvements (28\% to 85\%) were observed with S.S.C. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed in sensors' sensitivity to soil temperature (T-soil), which ranged from 14 degrees C to 23 degrees C in silt loam and from 14 degrees C to 25 degrees C loamy sand during the experiments. The CS655, 10HS, 5TE, and TEROS 21 (MPS-6) sensors showed significant (p {\textless} 0.05) sensitivity to T-soil fluctuations, with T-soil explaining a maximum of 17\% of the variance observed in sensor performance. No statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) sensitivity was detected for any of the sensors in loamy sand. TEROS 21 (MPS-6) had the highest sensitivity to T-soil with a slope of -4.25. In contrast, while statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05), 5TE was the least sensitive to T-soil variability with a slope of 1.81. The information, data, and analyses presented here can be instrumental for informed sensor selection and use in decision-making in production fields with similar soil textures and soil water regimes.

AB  - Context. The research explores the benefits of real time tracking of soil moisture for various land management contexts and the importance of spatio-temporal modelling and mapping to gain clear and visual understanding of soil moisture fluxes across a farm. Aims. This research aims to outline the key processes required for building an operational on-farm soil moisture monitoring system where the product is highly granular daily soil moisture maps depicting variations temporally, spatially and vertically. Methods. We describe processes of capacitance soil moisture probe installation, data collection infrastructure, sensor calibration, spatio-temporal modelling, and mapping. Key results. An out-of-bag soil moisture evaluation modelling system was tested for nearly 2 years. We found a model accuracy (RMSE) estimate of 0.002 cmâˆ’3 cmâˆ’3 and concordance of 0.96 were found. This result is averaged over this period but fluctuated daily, and related to rainfall patterns across the target farm, which were not directly incorporated into the modelling framework. As expected, incorporating prior estimates of soil moisture into the modelling framework contributed to very accurate estimates of real time available soil moisture. Conclusions. This research promotes the importance of iterative improvements to the soil moisture monitoring system, particularly in areas of sensor recalibration and spatio-temporal modelling. We stress the need for a longer-term view and plan for ongoing maintenance and improvement of such systems in the emerging digital farming ecosystem. Implications. The results of this research will be useful for researchers and practitioners involved in the design and implementation of on-farm soil monitoring systems.

TI  - Calibration, measurement, and characterization of soil moisture dynamics in a central {Amazonian} tropical forest
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate soil moisture measurements in remote ecosystems such as the Amazon are difficult and limited because of logistical constraints. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are widely used to monitor soil moisture and require calibration to convert the TDR's dielectric permittivity measurement (Ka) to volumetric water content (Î¸v). In this study, our objectives were to develop a field-based calibration of TDR sensors in an old-growth upland forest in the central Amazon, to evaluate the performance of the calibration, and then to apply the calibration to determine the dynamics of soil moisture content within a 14.2-m-deep vertical soil profile. Depth-specific TDR calibration using local soils in a controlled laboratory setting yielded a novel Kaâ€“Î¸v third-degree polynomial calibration. The sensors were later installed to their specific calibration depth in a 14.2-m pit. The widely used Kaâ€“Î¸v relationship (Topp model) underestimated the site-specific Î¸v by 22â€“42\%, indicating significant error in the model when applied to these well-structured, clay-rich tropical forest soils. The calibrated wet- and dry-season Î¸v data showed a variety of depth and temporal variations highlighting the importance of soil textural differentiation, root uptake depths, as well as event to seasonal precipitation effects. Data such as these are greatly needed for improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes within tropical forests and for improving models of these systems in the face of changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Soil fertility attributes have different scales and forms of spatial and temporal variations in agricultural fields. Adequate spatiotemporal characterization of these attributes is fundamental to the successful development of strategies for variable rate application of fertilizers, enabling the classic benefits of precision agriculture (PA). Studies on Brazilian soil have shown that at least 1 sample ha(-1) is required for the reliable mapping of key fertility attributes. However, this sampling density is difficult owing to the operational challenges of sample collection and the cost of laboratory analyses. Given this limitation, soil sensors have emerged as a practical and complementary technique for obtaining information on soil attributes, at high spatial density, without the production of chemical residues and at a reduced cost. Scientists worldwide have devoted their attention to the development and application of sensor systems for this purpose. The concept of proximal soil sensing (PSS) was established in 2011 and involves the application of soil sensors directly on the field. PSS techniques involve different disciplines, such as instrumentation, data science, geostatistics, and predictive modeling. The integration of these different disciplines has allowed successful sensor application for the spatial diagnosis of soil fertility attributes. The present work aimed to present a bibliographic review of the concepts involved and main techniques used in soil sensing to predict fertility attributes. We sought to present a broad view of the challenges, advances, and perspectives of sensor application in Brazilian tropical soils in the context of PA.

TI  - Real-time measurement of the moisture contents of dewatered sewage sludge during thermal drying using a low-cost {ECH}$_{\textrm{2}}${O} {EC}-5 soil moisture sensor
VL  - 41
SN  - 0737-3937
AB  - Real-time measurement of sewage sludge moisture content renders it possible to optimize the consumption of auxiliary fuel and the thermal treatment. Thus, we explored whether a dielectric soil moisture sensor could be used to measure real-time changes in sludge moisture content. This was possible with the aid of a unified calibration curve. The explanatory variable was the third-order sensor output voltage. The calibration curve well-fitted the data; the mean measurement error was 6.14 wt.\%. The use of individual calibration curves for each sludge batch reduced the mean measurement error to 3.09 wt.\%. The mean measurement error improves when multiple sensors are simultaneously used. The sensor operates very well when the moisture content is low; the results are minimally affected by the bulk density and Fe level. Considering feed-back to the process, it is ideal to measure sludge moisture content near the outlet of the thermal treatment.

TI  - Impact of calibrating a low-cost capacitance-based soil moisture sensor on {AquaCrop} model performance
VL  - 353
SN  - NA
AB  - Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost, and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability. This study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil moisture sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with both laboratory and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise linear regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 \%, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018, in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100) taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), followed by laboratory calibration against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 \%) and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 \%). Moreover, model overfitting with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly. Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible. The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity. Â© 2024 The Authors

TI  - The regulation effect of preventing soil nitrogen loss using microbial quorum sensing inhibitors
VL  - 246
SN  - NA
AB  - Preventing soil nitrogen (N) losses driven by microbial nitrification and denitrification contributes to improving global environmental concerns caused by NO3âˆ’-N leaching and N2O emission. Quorum sensing (QS) signals regulate nitrification and denitrification of N-cycling bacteria in pure culture and water treatment systems, and mediate the composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in activated sludge. However, whether disrupting QS could prevent soil N losses remains unclear. This study explored the feasibility of applying quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) as an innovative strategy to reduce N losses from agricultural soils. The two QSIs, penicillic acid and 4-iodo-N-[(3S)-tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl]-benzeneacetamide (4-iodo PHL), were more effective in reducing N losses than traditional inhibitors, including N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate. After 36 days of aerobic incubation, penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL inhibited nitrification by 39\% and 68\%, respectively. The inhibitory effects are attributed to the fact that 4-iodo PHL decreased the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes, as well as the relative abundance of Candidatus Nitrocosmicus (AOA), Candidatus Nitrososphaera (AOA), and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria/comammox), while penicillic acid reduced archaeal amoA abundance and the relative abundance of Nitrosospira (AOB) and the microbes listed above. Penicillic acid also strongly inhibited denitrification (33\%) and N2O emissions (61\%) at the peak of N2O production (day 4 of anaerobic incubation) via decreasing nitrate reductase gene (narG) abundance and increasing N2O reductase gene (nosZ) abundance, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental risks of QSIs to microbial community structure and network stability, CO2 emissions, and soil animals were acceptable. Overall, QSIs have application potential in agriculture to reduce soil N losses and the associated effect on climate change. This study established a new method to mitigate N losses from the perspective of QS, and can serve as important basis of decreasing the environmental risks of agricultural non-point source pollution.

VL  - 86
SN  - 0021-9037
AB  - Spectroscopy has been applied in monitoring soil nutrient concentrations. Two types of soil samples, sandy loam and silty loam, were selected as the research objects. The UV-visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy data and total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (FK), and slowly available potassium (SK) concentrations were measured. We compared the prediction results within and between two different types of soil with regard to the soil nutrient concentrations using four modeling methods, which were principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models. In the prediction results within a given type of soil, LS-SVM and PLSR had better stability. In the prediction results of different types of soil, BPNN and LS-SVM had a high accuracy in most soil nutrient concentrations. By comparing different modeling methods, this study provides a basis for the subsequent selection of suitable models based on spectral technology to establish various soil nutrient models.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil water content (SWC) is a major determinant of crop production, and accurately retrieving SWC plays a crucial role in effective water management. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can acquire images with high temporal and spatial resolutions for SWC monitoring at the field scale. The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm to retrieve SWC by integrating soil texture into a vegetation index derived from UAS multispectral and thermal images. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s) derived from the UAS multispectral and thermal images were employed to construct the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) using the trapezoid model. Soil texture was incorporated into the trapezoid model based on the relationship between soil texture and the lower and upper limits of SWC to form the texture temperature vegetation dryness index (TTVDI). For validation, 128 surface soil samples, 84 in 2019 and 44 in 2020, were collected to determine soil texture and gravimetric SWC. Based on the linear regression models, the TTVDI had better performance in estimating SWC compared to the TVDI, with an increase in R-2 (coefficient of determination) by 14.5\% and 14.9\%, and a decrease in RMSE (root mean square error) by 46.1\% and 10.8\%, for the 2019 and 2020 samples, respectively. The application of the TTVDI model based on high-resolution multispectral and thermal UAS images has the potential to accurately and timely retrieve SWC at the field scale.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Water resource planning and management necessitates understanding soil moisture changes with depth in the root zone at the farm scale. For measuring soil moisture, remote sensing methods have been relatively successful. Soil moisture is estimated from image data, using in situ moisture and an empirical scattering model via regression fit analysis. However, in situ sensor data are prone to misinterpretations, requiring verification. Herein, we aimed at investigating the application of soil moisture from the water balance model towards verification of in situ soil moisture sensor data before in situ data was assessed for its relationship with remote sensing data. In situ soil moisture sensor data was obtained at 10 and 30 cm, and CROPWAT8.0 furnished root zone soil moisture data. The correlation between the in situ soil moisture at 10 and 30 cm was 0.78; the correlation between the soil moisture from CROPWAT8.0 and the in situ soil moisture were 0.64 and 0.62 at 10 and 30 cm, respectively. The R2 between Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficients and in situ moisture were 0.74 and 0.68 at each depth, respectively. Therefore, the water balance model could verify sensor results before assessing in situ soil moisture data for relationship with remote sensing data. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Impacts of introducing remote sensing soil moisture in calibrating a distributed hydrological model for streamflow simulation
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - With the increased availability of remote sensing products, more hydrological variables (e.g., soil moisture and evapotranspiration) other than streamflow data are introduced into the calibration procedure of a hydrological model. However, how the incorporation of these hydrological variables influences the calibration results remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the impact of remote sensing soil moisture data in the joint calibration of a distributed hydrological model. The investigation was carried out in Qujiang and Ganjiang catchments in southern China, where the Dem-based Distributed Rainfall-runoff Model (DDRM) was calibrated under different calibration schemes where the streamflow data and the remote sensing soil moisture are assigned to different weights in the objective function. The remote sensing soil moisture data are from the SMAP L3 soil moisture product. The results show that different weights of soil moisture in the objective function can lead to very slight differences in simulation performance of soil moisture and streamflow. Besides, the joint calibration shows no apparent advantages in terms of streamflow simulation over the traditional calibration using streamflow data only. More studies including various remote sensing soil moisture products are necessary to access their effect on the joint calibration. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Using fuzzy-{AHP} and parametric technique to assess soil fertility status in {Northeast} of {Iran
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - A good understanding of the levels and distribution patterns of soil properties and/or quality indicators is a prerequisite for developing sustainable agricultural land management programs. Traditional assessments of these parameters of soil fertility status are somewhat costly, in both economics and time aspects. Different modelling techniques have been proposed as a useful tool for determination of soil quality indicators and development of soil fertility maps, but to what extent these results are reliable remains under-quantified in many regions worldwide. To address this uncertainty, Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) and Parametric analyses were conducted to ascertain the soil fertility status of a semiarid region in the Northeast of Iran for some selected crops: alfalfa, corn silage, potato, sugar beet, tomato and wheat. The Fuzzy-AHP and Parametric techniques using soil suitability indices were estimated for each crop and each soil delineation was achieved by Ordinary Kriging. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used as a compensatory method to allow tradeoffs among the selected criteria. Our results demonstrated that from the Fuzzy-AHP analysis, the soil fertility indices ranged from moderate to high for production of alfalfa; from low to high for production of corn silage and sugar beet; moderate to high for production of potato and tomato; and from low to moderate for production of wheat. However, the parametric analysis showed soil fertility classes ranging from very low to high for production of all the selected crops. High correlations were also observed between soil fertility indices predicted by both models. Similarly, the capacities of both models to predict soil fertility status for production of the selected crops were also highly correlated. The preference for the cultivation of the selected crops based on the Fuzzy-AHP analysis was sugar beet {\textgreater} corn silage {\textgreater} wheat {\textgreater} alfalfa {\textgreater} tomato {\textgreater} potato. On the other hand, using Parametric techniques, the crops preferences for cultivation ranked as corn silage {\textgreater} wheat {\textgreater} alfalfa {\textgreater} sugar beet {\textgreater} tomato {\textgreater} potato. We concluded that the findings would help to develop sustainable plans of cultivation based on patterns related to soil fertility classes depending on each cropâ€™s requirement.

TI  - Towards improved field application of using distributed temperature sensing for soil moisture estimation: {A} laboratory experiment
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - The â€œdual probe heat pulseâ€ (DPHP) method using actively heated fiber optic (AHFO) cables combined with distributed temperate sensing (DTS) technology has been developed for monitoring thermal properties and soil water content at the field scale. Field scale application, however, requires the use of robust and thicker fiber optic cables, corroborating the assumption of an infinite thin heat source in the evaluation process. We therefore included a semi-analytical solution of the heat transport equation into the evaluation procedure in order to consider the finite thermal properties of the heating cable without a calibration procedure to estimate effective thermal properties of the soil. To test this new evaluation procedure, we conducted a laboratory experiment and tested different heating scenarios to infer soil moisture from volumetric heat capacity. Estimates were made by analyzing the shift of the temperature amplitude at the sensing cable and the characteristics of the response heating curve. The results were compared with results from the calibrated infinite line source solution and in situ water content point measurements and showed a good approximation of thermal properties for strong and short heat pulses. Volumetric water content estimates are similarly accurate to the results of the calibrated infinite line source solution. Problems arose with the cable spacing and the resettlement process after burying the cable. Â© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - The soil dielectric constant model is essential for retrieving soil properties based on microwave remote sensing. However, the existing saline soil dielectric constant models perform poorly in simulating the dielectric constant of soil with high water content and salinity. In this study, the Wang Yueru (WYR) saline soil dielectric constant model, which was demonstrated to perform well in describing the effect of salinity and moisture on the dielectric constant, was validated based on experimental measurements of soil samples under different water content and salinity degrees. Furthermore, we adjusted the model form, refitted the empirical coefficient in the model, and finally acquired a two-stage model for simulating the soil dielectric constant. The enhanced model was validated under different soil moisture and salinity ranges using experimental measurements of soil samples. Compared to the original model, the proposed model exhibits a larger improvement in simulating the soil dielectric constant, and the RMSE of the simulated results dramatically decreased from 7.3 to 1.6, especially for soil with high salinity and water content. On this basis, a model suitable for L-band microwave was established. This model is of great significance for studying soil dielectric characteristics and retrieving soil parameters based on L-band data. Furthermore, this model can be used to retrieve soil salinity and water content using microwave remote sensing under a broadened application situation, such as in saline-alkali soils, wetlands, and salt marshes.

TI  - Soil moisture content estimation in winter wheat planting area for multi-source sensing data using {CNNR
VL  - 193
SN  - NA
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is an important part of precision agriculture, and it is also one of the key problems to be solved in field real-time monitoring and precision irrigation. Most of the existing studies are limited to SMC monitoring of bare soil, which can be obtained by optical remote sensing (e.g., multispectral, hyperspectral) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, for the soil covered by vegetation, such as farmland, there are some theoretical defects with only one of the measuring methods. Meanwhile, in order to break through the limitations of low spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite remote sensing, it is of great significance to study SMC retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing data for the near earth UAV remote sensing systems. Based on this, this paper, taking the winter wheat planting area in Guanzhong plain of China as the research area, combines the advantages of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar, and multispectral remote sensing data, to reduce the influences of vegetation coverage on the estimation accuracy. A one-dimensional regression convolution neural network model is constructed to realize the quantitative prediction and estimation of SMC in farmland. The carried out experiments show that the proposed CNNR model has a better performance than traditional SVR and GRNN models and the R2, RMSE and RPD are 0.7453, 0.0140 cm3/cm3 and 1.9246, respectively. After introducing NDVI, MSAVI and DVI vegetation indices generated from multispectral images, the accuracy of the three models increased significantly. Among the three models, the constructed CNNR model has the best performance, and its R2, RMSE and RPD reach 0.9168, 0.0089 cm3/cm3, and 3.0201. Furthermore, after adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the original radar echoes, the CNNR model constructed in this paper still has the highest prediction accuracy and the strongest noise robustness.

Hyperspectral (350â€“2500 nm) monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) could provide a theoretical basis for the real-time estimation of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture. During this study, we have developed SMC prediction models in different soil moisture ranges by using the combination of spectral preprocessing methods and optimized spectral indices. Results indicated that first-order derivative (FD) preprocessing method can highlight the effective information of the spectra and improve the correlation between spectral reflectance and SMC. The spectral reflectance exhibited a strong correlation with SMC near 1400, 1700, 1900, and 2200 nm. The FD-NDSI-W0-model had the best SMC prediction and applicability (R2 = 0.977, root mean square error = 3.413\%, relative percent deviation = 6.171) to predict SMCs. Overall, pretreatment methods, combined with the two-band random combination to optimize the spectral index to build a prediction model of SMC, could be applied for accurate monitoring of SMC.

VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) sensing allows for non-invasive soil moisture measurements at the field scale and relies on the inverse correlation between aboveground measured epithermal neutron intensity (1 eVâˆ’100 keV) and environmental water content. The measurement uncertainty follows Poisson statistics and thus increases with decreasing neutron intensity, which corresponds to increasing soil moisture. In order to reduce measurement uncertainty, the neutron count rate is usually aggregated over 12 or 24 h time windows for stationary CRN probes. To obtain accurate soil moisture estimates with mobile CRN rover applications, the aggregation of neutron measurements is also necessary and should consider soil wetness and driving speed. To date, the optimization of spatial aggregation of mobile CRN observations in order to balance measurement accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture patterns has not been investigated in detail. In this work, we present and apply an easy-to-use method based on Gaussian error propagation theory for uncertainty quantification of soil moisture measurements obtained with CRN sensing. We used a 3rd order Taylor expansion for estimating the soil moisture uncertainty from uncertainty in neutron counts and compared the results to a Monte Carlo approach with excellent agreement. Furthermore, we applied our method with selected aggregation times to investigate how CRN rover survey design affects soil moisture estimation uncertainty. We anticipate that the new approach can be used to improve the strategic planning and evaluation of CRN rover surveys based on uncertainty requirements.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring in {Iran} by implementing satellite data into the {Root}-{Zone} {SMAR} model
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) and Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) dynamics at the regional scale is of fundamental importance to many hydrological and ecological studies. This need becomes even more critical in arid and semi-arid regions, where there are a lack of in situ observations. In this regard, satellite-based Soil Moisture (SM) data is promising due to the temporal resolution of acquisitions and the spatial coverage of observations. Satellite-based SM products are only able to estimate moisture from the soil top layer; however, linking SSM with RZSM would provide valuable information on land surface-atmosphere interactions. In the present study, satellite-based SSM data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are first compared with the few available SM in situ observations, and are then coupled with the Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) model to estimate RZSM in Iran. The comparison between in situ SM observations and satellite data showed that the SMAP satellite products provide more accurate description of SSM with an average correlation coefficient (R) of 0.55, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.078 m3 m-3 and a Bias of 0.033 m3 m-3. Thereafter, the SMAP satellite products were coupled with SMAR model, providing a description of the RZSM with performances that are strongly influenced by the misalignment between point and pixel processes measured in the preliminary comparison of SSM data.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an essential role in geoscience research. The SMC can be retrieved using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on remote sensing data. The quantity and quality of samples for ANN training and testing are two critical factors that affect the SMC retrieving results. This study focused on sample optimization in both quantity and quality. On the one hand, a sparse sample exploitation (SSE) method was developed to solve the problem of sample scarcity, resultant from cloud obstruction in optical images and the malfunction of in situ SMCmeasuring instruments. With this method, data typically excluded in conventional approaches can be adequately employed. On the other hand, apart from the basic input parameters commonly discussed in previous studies, a couple of new parameters were optimized to improve the feature description. The Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat-8 images were adopted to retrieve SMC in the study area in eastern Austria. By the SSE method, the number of available samples increased from 264 to 635 for ANN training and testing, and the retrieval accuracy could be markedly improved. Furthermore, the optimized parameters also improve the inversion effect, and the elevation was the most influential input parameter. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Availability of global satellite based Soil Moisture (SM) data has promoted the emergence of many applications in climate studies, agricultural water resource management and hydrology. In this context, validation of the global data set is of substance. Remote sensing measurements which are representative of an area covering 100 m2 to tens of km2 rarely match with in situ SM measurements at point scale due to scale difference. In this paper we present the new Indian Cosmic Ray Network (ICON) and compare it's data with remotely sensed SM at different depths. ICON is the first network in India of the kind. It is operational since 2016 and consist of seven sites equipped with the COSMOS instrument. This instrument is based on the Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) technique which uses non-invasive neutron counts as a measure of soil moisture. It provides in situ measurements over an area with a radius of 150-250 m. This intermediate scale soil moisture is of interest for the validation of satellite SM. We compare the COSMOS derived soil moisture to surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil moisture (RZSM) derived from SMOS, SMAP and GLDAS\_Noah. The comparison with surface soil moisture products yield that the SMAP\_L4\_SSM showed best performance over all the sites with correlation (R) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.90. RZSM on the other hand from all products showed lesser performances. RZSM for GLDAS and SMAP\_L4 products show that the results are better for the top layer R = 0.75 to 0.89 and 0.75 to 0.90 respectively than the deeper layers R = 0.26 to 0.92 and 0.6 to 0.8 respectively in all sites in India. The ICON network will be a useful tool for the calibration and validation activities for future SM missions like the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR).

TI  - Research on robust inversion model of soil moisture content based on {GF}-1 satellite remote sensing
VL  - 213
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aims to improve the accuracy and applicability of traditional linear regression and machine learning algorithms for monitoring soil moisture content by satellite remote sensing. Shahaoqu Experimental Station within Jiefangzha Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation Area is selected as the study area. The dataset includes GF-1 satellite remote sensing images and measured soil moisture content. The study employs the best subset selection to determine the combination of sensitive variables for soil moisture content at different soil depths. Additionally, robust regression theory is introduced to traditional linear regression and machine learning algorithms to construct soil moisture content inversion models at different soil depths. The results show that all three improved robust algorithms effectively reduce the influence of outliers, improve the accuracy and stability of these inversion models. The improved robust nonlinear algorithm outperforms the improved robust linear algorithm. Compared with the unprocessed algorithm, at the soil depth of 0â€“20 cm, Robust Extreme Learning Machine (RELM) algorithm is the most optimal, with the validation set's R2adj increasing from 0.555 to 0.696 (approximately 25.33\%) and the RMSE decreasing from 0.025 to 0.018 (approximately 26.54\%). Robust Least Squares Support Vector Machine (RLSSVM) algorithm is the second best, with the validation set's R2adj increasing from 0.502 to 0.641 (approximately 27.75\%) and the RMSE decreasing from 0.026 to 0.020 (approximately 24.59\%). Robust Linear Regression (LMS-RLS) algorithm is relatively the worst, with the validation set's R2adj increasing from 0.491 to 0.659 (approximately 34.05\%) and the RMSE decreasing from 0.026 to 0.019 (approximately 27.21\%). The sensitivity of the five soil depths to soil moisture content follows the order of 0â€“20 cm, 20â€“40 cm, 0â€“60 cm, 0â€“40 cm, and 40â€“60 cm. The improved robust regression algorithms can improve the accuracy and applicability of soil moisture content estimation and provide a reference for monitoring soil moisture content using GF-1 satellite.

TI  - Using regional characteristics to improve uncalibrated estimation of rootzone soil moisture from optical/thermal remote-sensing
VL  - 273
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote-sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine-resolution (30 m) rootzone soil moisture Î¸Â¯. In these methods, Î¸Â¯ is most commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with evaporative fraction Î›SEB or evaporative index Î›PET. Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but those methods have not yet been applied to estimate Î¸Â¯ from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Î¸Â¯ estimates from remote sensing when the Î›SEBvs.Î¸Â¯ and Î›PETvs.Î¸Â¯ relationships are inferred from regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona, the PiÃ±on Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi. The Î¸Â¯ estimates from the regionally adapted relationships are compared to Î¸Â¯ estimates from the single empirical relationship and to in situ Î¸Â¯ measurements. The estimates from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance typically improves as more regional information is used in the relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of Î¸Â¯ by an average of 45\% among the four regions. The regional method typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root mean squared errors of 0.05 cm3cmâˆ’3 and 0.04 cm3cmâˆ’3, respectively. The regionally adapted relationships better capture both spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture than the single empirical relationship. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Improving soil moisture content to increase strawberry growth indicators using the hydroponic method
VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - Water and soil moisture management are very important factors in strawberry cultivation, and they directly affect strawberry growth and yield. Full moisture and suitable soil moisture can promote strawberry growth and grow faster and higher; proper soil moisture can maintain soil nutrients and prevent soil loss, thus maintaining soil fertility. In addition, adequate moisture and suitable soil moisture can make the strawberry grow more healthily, thus improving its quality and reducing the occurrence of hollow fruit. Therefore, in strawberry cultivation, reasonable water and soil moisture management is very important, growers need to carry out timely irrigation and drainage according to the growth of strawberry, to ensure the growth and yield of strawberry. Its disadvantages include the following: vulnerable to diseases and pests, high requirements for climatic conditions, high requirements for climatic conditions and high production costs. As a new agricultural technology, hydroponics can save land resources and reduce land pollution by cultivating plants in containers instead of planting plants on the land. Â© 2023 The Authors.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Although vegetation community information such as grazing gradient, biomass, and density have been well characterized in typical grassland communities with Stipa grandis and Leymus chinensis as dominant species, their impact on the soil moisture (SM) inversion is still unclear. This study investigated the characteristics of a grassland vegetation community at different grazing gradients and growing seasons and its impact on SM inversion using remote sensing data. The water cloud model (WCM) was used for SM inversion, and both field and remote sensing data collected from 2019 to 2021 were used for calibration and prediction. The study found that the calibrated WCM achieved prediction results of SM inversion with average R2 values of 0.41 and 0.38 at different grazing gradients and growing seasons, respectively. Vegetation biomass and height were significantly correlated with vegetation indexes, and the highest model prediction accuracy was achieved for biomass and height around 121.1 g/m2 [102.3â€“139.9] and 18.6 cm [17.3â€“19.8], respectively. Generally, NDWI1 produced higher SM estimation accuracy than NDWI2. The growing season of vegetation also affects the accuracy of the WCM to retrieve SM, with the highest accuracy achieved in mid-growing season I. Therefore, the developed WCM with optimal height and biomass of vegetation communities can enhance the SM prediction capacity; it thus can be potentially used for SM prediction in typical grasslands.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding nutrient quantity and quality in forest soils is important for sustainable management of forest resources and maintaining forest ecosystem services. In this study, six soil nutrient indicators, including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) were measured in five different aged stands of Chinese fir forests in subtropical China. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed based on these soil nutrients indicators in order to better evaluate the soil fertility index (SFI) in these studied forests. The results show that soil nutrient contents changed with the soil depth in different age groups. The SOM decreased in a specific order: over mature {\textgreater} mature {\textgreater} near mature {\textgreater} middle {\textgreater} young stands. The TN content of the soil gradually decreased with increased soil depth throughout all age groups. The SEM indicated that the TN had the highest weight of 0.4154, while the TP had the lowest weight at 0.1991 for estimating the SFI. The weights of other indicators (AN, SOM, AP, and AK) ranged 0.2138â€“0.3855 in our study. The established SEM satisfied the fitness reference values and was able to accurately describe the forest soil nutrient status through the SFI. The overall SFI values were significantly higher in over mature stands than in young-aged stands and in topsoil than in deeper soil in all examined forests. Soil TN, AP, and AK were the most important nutrient indicators to the evaluation of the SFI in the study sites. The results confirmed that the SEM was suitable to estimate the weights of the SFI and better describe the soil nutrient status in forests. Our research provides an innovative approach to assess a soil nutrient status and soil fertility and provides a scientific basis for accurate implementation of soil nutrient assessment in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Estimating catchment scale soil moisture at a high spatial resolution: {Integrating} remote sensing and machine learning
VL  - 776
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture information is important for a wide range of applications including hydrologic modelling, climatic modelling and agriculture. L-band passive microwave satellite remote sensing is the most feasible option to estimate near-surface soil moisture ( 0â€“5 cm soil depth) over large extents, but its coarse resolution ( 10s of km) means that it is unable to capture the variability of soil moisture in detail. Therefore, different downscaling methods have been tested as a solution to meet the demand for high spatial resolution soil moisture. Downscaling algorithms based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between diurnal soil temperature difference (Î”T) and daily mean soil moisture content (Î¼SM) have shown promising results over arid and semi-arid landscapes. However, the linearity of these algorithms is affected by factors such as vegetation, soil texture and meteorology in a complex manner. This study tested a (i) Regression Tree (RT), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model based on the soil thermal inertia theory over a semi-arid agricultural landscape in Australia, given the ability of machine learning algorithms to capture complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and responses. Downscaled soil moisture from the RT, ANN and GPR models showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.07 cm3/cm3 compared to airborne retrievals and unbiased RMSEs (ubRMSEs) of 0.07, 0.08 and 0.05 cm3/cm3 compared to in-situ observations, respectively. The study showed encouraging results to integrate machine learning techniques in estimating near-surface soil moisture at a high spatial resolution. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is critical in monitoring the time-lagged impacts of agrometeorological drought. In Australia and several south-west Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), there are a limited number of in situ SM stations that can adequately assess soil-water availability in a near-real-time context. Satellite SM datasets provide a viable alternative for SM monitoring and agrometeorological drought provision in these regions. In this study, we investigated the performance of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS), SM from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) and SM from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) over Australia and south-west Pacific SIDS. Products were first evaluated in Australia, given the presence of several in-situ SM monitoring stations and a state-of-the-art hydrological model-the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape modelling system (AWRA-L). We further investigated the accuracy of SM satellite datasets in Australia and the south-west Pacific through Triple Collocation analysis with two other SM reference datasets-ERA5 reanalysis SM data and model data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. All datasets have differing observation periods ranging from 1911-now, with a common period of observations between 2015-2021. Results demonstrated that ASCAT and SMOS were consistently superior in their performance. Analysis in the six south-west Pacific SIDS indicated reduced performance for all products, with ASCAT and SMOS still performing better than others for most SIDS with median R values ranging between 0.3-0.9. We conducted a case study of the 2015 El Nino and Positive Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in Papua New Guinea. It was shown that ASCAT is a valuable dataset indicative of agrometeorological drought for the nation, highlighting the value of using satellite SM products to provide early warning of drought in data-sparse regions in the south-west Pacific.

TI  - A rapid fractionation method for assessing key soil phosphorus parameters in agroecosystems
VL  - 385
SN  - NA
AB  - A wide variety of soil phosphorus (P) fractionation schemes have been developed and used extensively for over 60 years, however, most are laborious and provide limited information on key parameters such as P mobility and adsorption. We propose an alternative multi-stage extraction technique that it is possible to complete in one day. This involves separate analysis of three subsamples, including assessment of inorganic P (Pi) adsorption capacity, P fractions (sequential extraction with 1 M CaCl2, Mehlich-3, 0.5 M NaOH, 1 M HCl, and total P (H2SO4-H2O2 digestion)). This provides data on potentially mobile Pi, plant-available Pi, moderately plant-available Pi, organic P, occluded P, the degree of P saturation, together with a â€œlegacy P indexâ€. Assessment of these parameters involved comparing two contrasting soils that had received similar P inputs as pig manure over two years. Results showed that P inputs significantly increased all soil P fractions, with concomitant significant increases in P saturation and legacy P. The findings of this study demonstrated the potential value in using the proposed methodology to provide a comprehensive suite of physico-chemical soil P data. This information may facilitate investigation and quantification of the impacts of land management and inputs on the dynamics and bioavailability of soil P in agroecosystems, although further assessment and validation is required.

VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content is an important hydrological parameter, which is difficult to measure at a field scale due to its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) is a novel and innovative approach to estimate area-averaged soil water content at an intermediate scale, which has been implemented across the globe. The CRNS is moderated by all hydrogen sources within its measurement footprint. In order to isolate the soil water content signal from the neutron intensity, the other sources of hydrogen need to be accounted for. The CRNS's applications are not only limited to soil water content estimation, as it can potentially be used to monitor biomass. The Two-Streams clear-felling provided the unique opportunity to monitor the cosmic ray neutron intensities before, during, and after the clear-felling. The cadmium-difference method was used to obtain the pure thermal and epithermal neutron intensities from the bare and moderated detectors. The study concluded that the presence of biomass within the site reduced the epithermal neutron intensity by 12.43\% and theN(0)value by 13.8\%. The use of the neutron ratio to monitor biomass was evaluated and changes in the neutron ratio coincided with biomass changes and resulted in a high correlation (R(2)of 0.868) with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and (R(2)of 0.817) leaf area index (LAI). The use of the CRNS to simultaneously monitor soil water content and biomass will be beneficial in providing more reliable soil water content estimates, provide biomass estimates at a field scale, and aid in understanding the dynamics between soil water content and vegetation.

In this article, we report the fabrication of Zinc oxide (ZnO) modified multi-walled Carbon nanotube (F-MWCNT) sensor specifically developed for soil nutrient sensing. A thin layer of Valinomycin membrane was grown on the top of the F-MWCNT/ZnO nanocomposite active layer. The resulting composite structure Al/F-MWCNT/ZnO/Valinomycin was found to have a proportional impedance change with soil Potassium (K+) levels.

TI  - A dual-probe heat pulse-based sensor that simultaneously determines soil thermal properties, soil water content and soil water matric potential
VL  - 188
SN  - NA
AB  - A dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensor is a robust tool that can measure soil thermal properties and associated soil physical properties and processes. A new DPHP based sensor was developed to simultaneously measure soil thermal properties, soil water content and soil water matric potential. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the sensor performance. The new sensor was able to measure each soil property with acceptable accuracy. The accuracy of the matric potential determinations was approximately 10\% in log scale. The effective range for Ïˆ measurements was âˆ’1000 to âˆ’2.5 m of water, and the accuracy of the Ïˆ determinations was best between âˆ’350 and âˆ’2.5 m of water, which included values of field capacity and wilting point for most soils and crops. The sensor design included a single heater wire to provide simultaneous heat inputs to two different materials, i.e., the soil and the sensor porous medium. The single heater wire did not influence sensor accuracy as long as the soil and the sensor porous medium thermal conductivity values were not significantly different. The new DPHP based sensor effectively measured various soil properties, including soil water matric potential, soil water content, and soil thermal property values. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect of {X}-{Ray} {Tube} {Configuration} on {Measurement} of {Key} {Soil} {Fertility} {Attributes} with {XRF
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The successful use of energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) sensors for soil analysis requires the selection of an optimal procedure of data acquisition and a simple modelling approach. This work aimed at assessing the performance of a portable XRF (XRF) sensor set up with two different X-ray tube configurations (combinations of voltage and current) to predict nine key soil fertility attributes: (clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable nutrients (P, K, Ca, and Mg). An XRF, operated at a voltage of 15 kV (and current of 23 mu A) and 35 kV (and current of 7 mu A), was used for analyzing 102 soil samples collected from two agricultural fields in Brazil. Two different XRF data analysis scenarios were used to build the predictive models: (i) 10 emission lines of 15 keV spectra (EL-15), and (ii) 12 emission lines of 35 keV spectra (EL-35). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used for model calibration, and the models' prediction performance was evaluated using different figures of merit. The results show that although X-ray tube configuration affected the intensity of the emission lines of the different elements detected, it did not influence the prediction accuracy of the studied key fertility attributes, suggesting that both X-ray tube configurations tested can be used for future analyses. Satisfactory predictions with residual prediction deviation (RPD) {\textgreater}= 1.54 and coefficient of determination (R-2) {\textgreater}= 0.61 were obtained for eight out of the ten studied soil fertility attributes (clay, OM, CEC, V, and extractable K, Ca, and Mg). In addition, simple MLR models with a limited number of emission lines was effective for practical soil analysis of the key soil fertility attributes (except pH and extractable P) using XRF. The simple and transparent methodology suggested also enables future researches that seek to optimize the XRF scanning time in order to speed up the XRF analysis in soil samples.

TI  - Can spectral analyses improve measurement of key soil fertility parameters with {X}-ray fluorescence spectrometry?
VL  - 350
SN  - NA
AB  - While laboratory methods of elemental analysis of soil nutrients are used frequently to support soil studies, the implementation of more portable and cost-efficient methods lingers behind. The portable (handheld) X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) is one such tool enabling onsite elemental analysis in a straightforward manner. However, in soil studies the use of XRF often remains cumbersome, following the poor performance of the method for low-Z elemental analysis and the complex nature of the soil matrix, introducing background noise. Here, we therefore evaluate how the potential use of a portable XRF for predicting potassium (K), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) can be improved through the analysis of XRF spectral data with the Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. A total of 105 soil samples from a wide range of soils collected from 10 different countries (D.R. Congo, Belgium, Ivory Coast, Italy, The Netherlands, Saudi-Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe) were scanned using an Oxford XMET8000 XRF spectrometer (Oxford Instruments, UK). Spectral data of the calibration set (n = 74) were pulled in one matrix alongside measured elemental concentrations and subjected to RF analysis. Resulting models were validated using an independent validation set (n = 31). The best RF prediction result was obtained for K followed successively by Ca, Mg and P with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.69, and 0.47, and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2283.8, 6818.7, 1511.8, and 538.08 mg kgâˆ’1, respectively. The RF modelling procedure provided improved prediction performance compared to the calibration models provided by the manufacturer (R2 = 0.65, 0.75, 0.65, and 0.22, for K, Ca, Mg and P, respectively). Our results suggest that portable XRF instruments coupled with spectral data analysis by RF allows for rapid and low-cost analysis of soil K and Ca with remarkable accuracy. Still, the lower measurement accuracy for P and Mg suggests further work is needed to test whether the prediction can be improved by better calibration models, and how such approaches can help overcoming instrumental limitations.

TI  - Improvement of multi-layer soil moisture prediction using support vector machines and ensemble {Kalman} filter coupled with remote sensing soil moisture datasets over an agriculture dominant basin in {China
VL  - 35
SN  - 0885-6087
AB  - Soil moisture prediction is of great importance in crop yield forecasting and drought monitoring. In this study, the multi-layer root zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy., : The performance of SVM is better in the surface moisture prediction (0-10 cm) than in the deeper layers (10-100 cm). Compare to SVM, SVM-EnKF can significantly improve the accuracy of multi-layer soil moisture prediction, and its performance remains stable. SMAP can improve the performance of SVM in multi-layer soil moisture prediction, while ASCAT and AMSR2 cannot. All three products can no further improve SVM-EnKF. Different from SVM, SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence from extreme values of remote sensing soil moisture., (C) 2021 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

TI  - Estimation and evaluation of high spatial resolution surface soil moisture using multi-sensor multi-resolution approach
VL  - 378
SN  - NA
AB  - Various soil moisture products (AMSR-E at 25 km, SMAP at 9 km, CCI at 25 km) available from different space agencies, derived using the active microwave remote sensing, may not be suitable for studies at a local level due to their coarse spatial resolution. Hence, an attempt has been made in this study to estimate the surface soil moisture at high spatial resolution using different high-resolution multispectral imageries from Landsat 8 OLI (Optical Land Imager) and Sentinel 2A MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), of similar date. The thermal (10.9 Âµm) and short wave infra-red (SWIR) (2.2 Âµm) bands of the Landsat image and the SWIR band (2.19 Âµm) of Sentinel image were used to estimate the soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 30 m and 20 m respectively, whereas the red and near infrared (NIR) bands of both the images were used to estimate the dryness. As the thermal band at high spatial resolution (at 20 m or below) is not available, this study attempted to bridge the gap and integrate multi-sensor and multi-resolution feature space utilizing various scalable procedures so as to estimate soil moisture and dryness. Limitation due to unavailability of the thermal bands in Sentinel multispectral image was overcome through a bridging procedure using Landsat thermal bands derived LST and Sentinel derived NDVI to estimate Sentinel LST at 20 m. The distribution pattern of high-resolution estimated soil moisture in each coarse spatial resolution grid (1 km) was taken into consideration to downscale the available CCI and SMAP soil moisture data. The estimated soil moisture and dryness were upscaled to 1 km and then validated using the downscaled soil moisture products (SMAP and CCI), and a significant correlation having R2 greater than 0.8, 0.5 and 0.4 was observed for the thermal band derived soil moisture, short wave band derived soil moisture, and the red and NIR band derived dryness, respectively. To understand the temporal variability of the soil moisture, data from three different seasons representing extreme soil moisture conditions (winter, summer and monsoon) were analyzed and found that the independently estimated soil moisture had errors in temporal continuity and spatial spread. Hence, the estimated soil moisture was standardized using annual information which resulted in more accurate products, and the SWIR Transformed Reflectance (STR) derived soil moisture was more accurate than LST derived product.

SN  - 0895-9811
AB  - dos Santos Teixeira et al. evaluated the effectiveness of three different sensors, portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry, visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR), and NixProTM color sensor, in predicting six soil properties including sum of bases (SB), effective cation exchange capacity (eCEC), potential cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), soil organic matter (SOM) content, and soil pH, and compared their performance when used alone or in combination. Preprocessing methods and other variables were also analyzed. In this comment paper, some misuses of Kappa statistic in the original paper by dos Santos Teixeira et al. are discussed. The authors calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient to make categorical predictions for soil fertility classes. However, using Cohen's Kappa to estimate the intra-rater reliabilities (IRRs) is not appropriate on the condition of ordinal categorical variables in four or five categories in the original paper. We briefly introduce the Kappa statistic for evaluation of IRR between two raters and propose to use weighted Kappa to compute IRRs under such conditions. To conclude, we recognize that this does not significantly alter the conclusions of this paper, but it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate statistical tools are used.

Unlike previous studies and in a different simulation approach, the  soil moisture was determined using the angular distribution of thermal neutrons  using MCNPX2.6 Monte Carlo code, where a cylindrical BF(3) proportional counter  located at different polar angles was responsible for thermal neutron detection.  Both Monte Carlo library least-squares method (MCLLS) and artificial neural  networks (ANN) were used to calculate the soil moisture based on BF(3) count  rates with small relative error, about 2\% and 10\% maximum relative errors,  respectively.

TI  - Novel cosmic ray neutron sensor accurately captures field-scale soil moisture trends under heterogeneous soil textures
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical variable influencing plant water uptake, rainfall-runoff partition-ing, and near-surface atmospheric conditions. Soil moisture measurements are typically made using either in-situ sensors or by collecting samples, both methods which have a small spatial footprint or, in recent years, by remote sensing satellites with large spatial footprints. The cosmic ray neutron sensor (CRNS) is a proximal technology which provides estimates of field-averaged soil moisture within a radius of up to 240 m from the sensor, offering a much larger sensing footprint than point measurements and providing field-scale information that satellite soil moisture observations cannot capture. Here we compare volumetric soil moisture estimates derived from a novel, less expensive lithium (Li) foil-based CRNS to those from a more expensive commercially available3 He-based CRNS, to measurements from in-situ sensors, and to four intensive surveys of soil moisture in a field with highly variable soil texture. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the Li foil CRNS is comparable to that of the commercially available sensors (MAD = 0.020 m3 mâˆ’3 ), as are the detection radius and depth. Additionally, both sensors capture the influence of soil textural variability on field-average soil moisture. Because novel Li foil-based CRNSs are comparable in accuracy to and much less expensive than current commercially available CRNSs, there is strong potential for future adoption by land and water managers and increased adoption by researchers interested in obtaining field-scale estimates of soil moisture to improve water conservation and sustainability.

TI  - Towards rapid analysis with {XRF} sensor for assessing soil fertility attributes: {Effects} of dwell time reduction
VL  - 232
SN  - NA
AB  - The analysis time used for the diagnosis of soil fertility attributes using portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) sensors (between 30 and 90 s) is too long for in situ applications. The present study aimed at evaluating the trade-off between dwell time and XRF performance for assessing soil fertility attributes. A total of 102 soil samples acquired in two Brazilian agricultural fields were used, whose spectra were obtained using dwell times of 90, 60, 30, 15, 10, 7, 4, and 2 s to build and validate calibration models for clay, cation exchange capacity, and extractable K and Ca. Results revealed that it is possible to make drastic reductions in the XRF dwell time (from 90 to 2 s), while keeping excellent prediction performance [ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) between 3.52 and 8.32] for all the studied attributes. A dwell time of only 2 s performed satisfactorily and is an analysis time suitable for rapid in situ applications. In addition, it was shown that data from spectral databases previously collected that used long dwell times (e.g., 30, 60, 90 s) can be extrapolated to fast applications with shorter dwell times (e.g., 2 and 4 s), once standardization by the detector's live time has been performed. Anyhow, calibrations using a dwell time similar to the one of the validation set tended to show superior results and are therefore recommended. This study addresses the need and provides guidelines for optimizing XRF sensor analysis time for in situ applications in the context of precision agriculture. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A low-cost approach for soil moisture prediction using multi-sensor data and machine learning algorithm
VL  - 833
SN  - NA
AB  - A high-resolution soil moisture prediction method has recently gained its importance in various fields such as forestry, agricultural and land management. However, accurate, robust and non- cost prohibitive spatially monitoring of soil moisture is challenging. In this research, a new approach involving the use of advance machine learning (ML) models, and multi-sensor data fusion including Sentinel-1(S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (ALOS DSM) to predict precisely soil moisture at 10 m spatial resolution across research areas in Australia. The total of 52 predictor variables generated from S1, S2 and ALOS DSM data fusion, including vegetation indices, soil indices, water index, SAR transformation indices, ALOS DSM derived indices like digital model elevation (DEM), slope, and topographic wetness index (TWI). The field soil data from Western Australia was employed. The performance capability of extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) together with the genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer for features selection and optimization for soil moisture prediction in bare lands was examined and compared with various scenarios and ML models. The proposed model (the XGBR-GA model) with 21 optimal features obtained from GA was yielded the highest performance (R2 = 0. 891; RMSE = 0.875\%) compared to random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR). Conclusively, the new approach using the XGBR-GA with features from combination of reliable free-of-charge remotely sensed data from Sentinel and ALOS imagery can effectively estimate the spatial variability of soil moisture. The described framework can further support precision agriculture and drought resilience programs via water use efficiency and smart irrigation management for crop production. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper proposes a hyperspectral soil nutrient estimation method based on the bat algorithm (BA)-AdaBoost model. The spectral reflectance, the first derivative of the reflectance, and the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance are analyzed based on the 800 field soil samples and their hyperspectral data collected. The first derivative of the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance and the sensitive band was extracted using the correlation coefficient method, and the correlation of the content of soil organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium was solved. The BA is used to optimize the two core parameters of the AdaBoost model (i.e., the maximum number of iterations (n) and the weight reduction coefficient (v) of the weak learner), the classification and regression trees(CART) decision tree is selected as the weak regression learner of the model, and the coefficient of determination is used as parameter optimization. Based on the objective function value, a BA-AdaBoost model was constructed to estimate soil organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. The results show that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally optimal parameters. The AdaBoost model optimized by BA significantly improved accuracy and reliability. Among the three elements, soil organic matter estimation accuracy is the highest, and the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error are 0.867 and 0.151g cdot kg-1, respectively. Compared with the model before optimization, the model accuracy and reliability improved by 29.0\% and 24.1\%, respectively. The results indicate that hyperspectral technology combined with the BA-AdaBoost model has certain application prospects in field soil nutrient estimation. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - The daily soil water content monitoring of cropland in irrigation area using {Sentinel}-2/3 spatio-temporal fusion and machine learning
VL  - 132
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for crop growth. The digital mapping of field soil moisture distribution provides valuable information for agricultural water management. The optical satellite data provides fine scale soil moisture information for a region. However, these data are greatly limited due to cloud contamination and revisit period. Despite the reported beneficial effects of spatiotemporal fusion methods, the accurate estimates of high-resolution soil moisture through spatiotemporal fusion data are still unclear, particularly when using Sentinel-2/3 fusion images. This study introduces a new soil moisture estimation framework integrating spatio-temporal spectral information from Sentinel-2/3 fusion images and machine learning algorithm,and thus provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimation. The framework includes four fusion methods (ESTARRFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and STFMF) and four machine learning models (PLSR, SVM, RF and GBRT). The feasibility of the framework was validated in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and STFMF. The spatiotemporal fusion-machine learning estimation framework provided reliable estimation for multi-layer (0 âˆ¼ 20, 20 âˆ¼ 40 and 40 âˆ¼ 60 cm) soil water in the irrigation area. The dense time series of soil water generated by the framework facilitated the detection of irrigation events in the irrigated farmland. Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of Sentinel-2/3 fused images in providing high-resolution continuous daily monitoring of farmland soil water on a large scale. These high spatialâ€“temporal resolution time series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and water resource management, contributing to further expanding the application of satellite remote sensing in precision agriculture.

TI  - Following the cosmic-ray-neutron-sensing-based soil moisture under grassland and forest: {Exploring} the potential of optical and {SAR} remote sensing
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Deriving soil moisture content (SMC) at the regional scale with different spatial and temporal land cover changes is still a challenge for active and passive remote sensing systems, often coped with machine learning methods. So far, the reference measurements of the data-driven approaches are usually based on point data, which entails a scale gap to the resolution of the remote sensing data. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) indirectly provides SMC estimates of a soil volume covering more than 1 ha and vertical depth up to 80 cm and is thus able to narrow this scale gap. So far, the CRNS-based SMC has only been used as validation source of remote sensing based SMC products. Its beneficial large sensing volume, especially in depth, has not been exploited yet. However, the sensing volume of the CRNS, which is changing with hydrological conditions, bears challenges for the comparison with remote sensing observations. This study, for the fist time, aims to understand the direct linkage of optical (Sentinel 2) and SAR (Sentinel 1) data with CRNS-based SMC. Thereby, the CRNS-based SMC is obtained by an experimental CRNS cluster that covers the high temporal and spatial SMC variability of an entire pre-alpine subcatchment. Using different Random Forest regressions, we analyze the potentials and limitations of both remote sensing sensors to follow the CRNS-based SMC signal. Our results show that it is possible to link the CRNS-based SMC signal with SAR and optical remote sensing observations via Random Forest modelling. We found that Sentinel 2 data is able to separate wet from dry periods with a R2 of 0.68. It is less affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal and it is able to assign a land cover specific SMC distribution. However, Sentinel 2 regression models are not accurate (R2 {\textless} 0.21) in mapping the CRNS-based SMC for the frequently mowed grassland areas of the study site. It requires soil type and topographical information to accurately follow the CRNS-based SMC signal with Random Forest regression. Sentinel 1 data instead is affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal. It has reasonable model performance (R2 = 0.34) when the CRNS data correspond to surface SMC. Also for Sentinel 1 the retrieval is impacted by the mowing activities at the test site. When separating the CRNS data set into dry and wet periods, soil properties and topography are the main drivers of SMC estimation. Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 data add the existing temporal variability to the regression models. The analysis underlines the need of combining optical and SAR observations (Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2) as well as soil property and topographical information to understand and follow the CRNS-based SMC signal for different hydrological conditions and land cover types.

TI  - Mapping spatiotemporal soil moisture in highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes using mobile dual-spectra cosmic-ray neutron sensing
VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) maps are crucial for catchment-scale hydrological models used for water resource management and warning systems for droughts, floods, and wildfires. SM can be mapped by mobile cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) systems of moderated detectors at homogeneous landscapes of similar soil and vegetation. In this study, we present a new approach for mobile CRN detection to perform to its full potential, where CRN measurements can also be converted to SM at heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is based solely on thermal and epithermal neutron datasets obtained from mobile dual-spectra CRN detection, combined with theoretical developments using a particle transport model. For each measurement point, the land cover type is identified using the thermal-to-epithermal (T/E) ratio, and the relevant neutron-count-to-soil-moisture conversion function is estimated from CRN stations located at the main land cover types in the catchment. With this approach, the requirement of collecting 100+ soil samples for each point along the survey route is omitted. We use this T/E-dependent approach to obtain SM maps from 12 CRN surveys and compare it with a simple approach where only the conversion function from the agricultural site is used. SM by the simple approach is comparable to the estimates of the agricultural stations of a capacitance sensor network, while the estimates of the T/E-dependent approach also compare well with the heathland and forest stations. With accurate SM estimates for all landcover types, the average error is reduced from 0.089 to 0.038 when comparing CRN SM with space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission estimates.

TI  - Soil phosphorus availability mediates facilitation dynamic in maize-grass pea intercropping system
VL  - 234
SN  - NA
AB  - The intercropping-led diversified tillage is crucial for sustainable development in dryland agriculture. However, the plant-plant interaction transition and its effects on soil physiochemical characteristics along soil phosphorus (P) levels are not clear. To address this issue, maize-grass pea intercropping system was used to investigate the variations in plant-plant facilitation along soil P gradients (low- to high-P) and their effects on rhizosphere soil N and P availability and microbial biomass. The data showed that total net effect (NE) was always positive, indicating facilitative effects of intercropping on total community productivity. Specifically, the relative yield (RY) for both species was greater than 0.5 in the P-deficient soils, representing mutually facilitated effects. Yet, under the P-sufficient condition, maize and grass pea acted as facilitated species and facilitator respectively. Rhizosphere phosphatase activity was significantly enhanced in the P-deficient soils, accordingly fostering P mineralization for higher P availability and N utilization. The contents of microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e., MBC, MBN and MBP) were evidently elevated in intercropping systems than those of monoculture. Also, global meta-analysis verified above phenomenon, showing that high P addition decreased facilitation intensity with type shift, regarding plant productivity, N and P utilization and vice versa. We confirmed a relatively full picture of P-driven facilitation intensity and type shift along stress gradients by field observation and meta-analysis. The findings provided a new insight of biodiversity in soil physiochemical traits and also revealed a critical mechanism affecting resource utilization in the P-limited soils. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in the water-heat-energy exchange and water cycle of the land ecosystem. Long-term SM products are vital in the time series study of ecology and hydrology. Therefore, it is vital to extend the time span with limited SM monitoring sensors, since there is no single long-term SM product currently. In this study, an SM product prolonging method based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical products was proposed. The prolonging results of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Fenyun-3B (FY3B) products were validated in Tibetan Plateau to present the feasibility of this method. The result shows this method is feasible in areas under medium vegetation cover (0.2 {\textless} NDVI {\textless} 0.6), but it still needs to be improved in some areas (especially in areas with very high or very low NDVI). The prolonging data fits well ( R = 0.84, RMSE {\textless} 0.06 cm3 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 ) with in situ measurements for both SMAP and FY-3B products. The generated long-term SM will benefit the global water cycle study. Â© 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Watershed scale soil moisture estimation model using machine learning and remote sensing in a data-scarce context
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content can be used to predict drought impact on agricultural yield better than precipitation. Remote sensing is viable source of soil moisture data in instrument-scarce areas. However, space-based soil moisture estimates lack suitability for daily and high-resolution agricultural, hydrological, and environmental applications. This study aimed to assess the potential of the random forest machine learning technique to enhance the spatial resolution of remote soil moisture products from the SMAP satellite. Models were built using random forest for spatial downscaling of SMAP-L3-E, then visually and statistically evaluated for disaggregation quality. The impact of topography, soil properties, and precipitation on the downscaled soil moisture was examined. The relationship between downscaled soil moisture and in-situ soil moisture was analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed method demonstrated spatial and hydrological coherence, along with a satisfactory downscaling quality. Statistical validation indicated suitable generalization error for scientific and practical use (RMSE {\textless} 0.05 cm3 cm-3). Random forest effectively achieved spatial downscaling of SMAP-L3-E in the study area. Principal component and spatial analysis revealed dependence of downscaled soil moisture on elevation, soil organic carbon content, clay content, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, mainly under near-saturation conditions. Regarding validation against in-situ data, downscaled soil moisture explained in-situ soil moisture well under low soil water content (Ç· = 0.624). Downscaling performance deteriorates for water contents between 0.40 to 0.50 cm3 cm-3, suggesting inadequacy under near saturation conditions at a daily temporal frequency. However, coarser temporal aggregations (7 to 10 days) yielded an average 0.98 correlation coefficient, regardless of saturation conditions. These results could potentially be applied in irrigation planning, soil physics studies and hydrology monitoring, to forecasting the occurrence of droughts, leaching of contaminants, surface runoff modeling, carbon cycle studies, soil's capacity to store and provide nutrients. Our results could mainly be applied to understanding the impact of droughts on crop yield. Â© 2024 Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. All rights reserved.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important biophysical parameter by which to evaluate water resource potential, especially for agricultural activities under the pressure of global warming. The recent advancements in different types of satellite imagery coupled with deep learning-based frameworks have opened the door for large-scale SM estimation. In this research, high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data and high temporal resolution soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM data were combined to create short-term SM predictions that can accommodate agricultural activities in the field scale. We created a deep learning model to forecast the daily SM values by using time series of climate and radar satellite data along with the soil type and topographic data. The model was trained with static and dynamic features that influence SM retrieval. Although the topography and soil texture data were taken as stationary, SMAP SM data and Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter coefficients, including their ratios, and climate data were fed to the model as dynamic features. As a target data to train the model, we used in situ measurements acquired from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). We employed a deep learning framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with two hidden layers that have 32 unit sizes and a fully connected layer. The accuracy of the optimized LSTM model was found to be effective for SM prediction with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046, unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.045, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.033. The model's performance was also evaluated concerning above-ground biomass, land cover classes, soil texture variations, and climate classes. The model prediction ability was lower in areas with high normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. Moreover, the model can better predict in dry climate areas, such as arid and semi-arid climates, where precipitation is relatively low. The daily prediction of SM values based on microwave remote sensing data and geophysical features was successfully achieved by using an LSTM framework to assist various studies, such as hydrology and agriculture.

VL  - NA
SN  - 0885-6087
AB  - colon; High-quality soil moisture (SM) datasets are in great demand for climate, hydrology, and other fields, but detailed evaluation of SM products from various sources is scarce. Thus, using 670 SM stations worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote sensing [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data [ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54) correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b) Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales, and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in December-February and June-August, respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the accuracy of the above SM products., : Soil moisture products from various sources are evaluated.

AB  - Reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products are important for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle, especially in water-limited arid regions. However, it is essential to assess the reliability of SM products before they are used. In this study, surface SM from the European Reanalysis-Interim v5 (ERA5), Essential Climate Variables (ECV), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were assessed based on in-situ data and the Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) approach in a typical arid region, Central Asia (CA). The validation based on in-situ data indicated that all three products underestimated the observed surface SM, except for ERA5. The ERA5 SM was closest to the in-situ observations, averaging a higher correlation coefficient of 0.59, followed by the GLDAS, ECV, and FLDAS. The TCH method revealed low uncertainties ({\textless}0.05 m3/m3) for all four SM products, and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes. For ERA5 and ECV SM products, the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and forests, respectively. FLDAS and GLDAS SM products performed better in terms of uncertainty compared to ERA5 and ECV, with an average uncertainty below 0.03 m3/m3, except for forests. The above assessment results indicate that, compared with the other three SM products, ERA5 has a better performance and more potential for application in CA. There was an upward trend in surface SM from 1982 to 2018 in CA. The relationship between the four SM products and aridity index and drought events showed that GLDAS could capture the hydrothermal conditions and drought events, followed by FLDAS, ERA5, and ECV. Our research is intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded SM products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ensemble surface soil moisture estimates at farm-scale combining satellite-based optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing observations
VL  - 339
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing presents great potential for soil moisture mapping, although a lack of high-resolution, all-season suitable data and model-based complications hinders continuous mapping at the farm scale. The current study attempts to access optical (Sentinel-2) and microwave (Sentinel-1) based Water Cloud Model (WCM), optical and/or thermal-based Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Model (TOTRAM), and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) utilizing Landsat-8 data, and an ensemble of these three models synergistically using microwave, optical and thermal remote sensing data for fourteen dates spanning two post-monsoon periods over a semi-arid irrigated agricultural farm. The ensemble model developed with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) offered a superior SSM estimate for the entire crop growth season. The ensemble model had the lowest RMSE (0.053 m3 mâˆ’3), followed by OPTRAM (SWIR2) (0.06 m3 mâˆ’3), while TOTRAM recorded the highest RMSE (0.092 m3 mâˆ’3), even though the model performances varied throughout crop growth cycles. For SSM mapping in the early phases of crop growth, WCM or TOTRAM were found superior, while during the latter growth stages, the performance of OPTRAM was better. In contrast to TOTRAM, which needs local calibration as the land surface temperature is sensitive to atmospheric conditions, the study emphasizes the shortcomings of WCM in terms of calibration requirements for changing vegetation structure utilizing in situ data. OPTRAM is suitable for generating SSM maps in semi-arid environments with a predominance of clear skies throughout the post-monsoon season. It is straightforward, low data, and resource intensive with universal surface reflectance-soil moisture association. The ensemble technique can be recommended for farm-level irrigation mapping over a post-monsoon period. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 60
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil salinity plays a key role in influencing the soil dielectric constant and soil backscatter coefficient. However, soil moisture (SM) retrieval models constructed based on active microwave data hardly consider soil salinity. Thus, obtaining the SM datasets with various salinity on regional and local scales is difficult. This study aimed to employ theoretical model simulation to investigate the errors of SM retrieval due to not considering the impact of soil salinity. Then, three typical saline soil dielectric constant models were validated and compared based on the experimental measurement datasets. Results show that the WYR saline soil dielectric constant model has excellent performance. The soil salinity mainly affects the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and the effect of salinity on the soil dielectric constant is more significant when the SM has larger values. In addition, in retrieving SM with soil salinity more than 10 g/kg, the retrieval result of SM has an absolute error of 0.04 m3 m3 and a relative error of 5\% when not considering the soil salinity impact. In retrieving SM with soil salinity less than 10 g/kg, the retrieved SM error increased by 2\%, and the absolute error increased by 0.01 m3 m3 as soil salinity increased by 3 g/kg. We believe that The study will give a theoretical reference for establishing the SM retrieval model in saline soil areas using microwave data. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) practices and fertilization strategies can increase soil phosphorus (P) concentrations. Thus, soil P tests should be effective to guarantee correct interpretations of P. We evaluated the P concentrations in soil and the efficiency of the P extraction procedures by Mehlich-1 extractant and by ion exchange resin (IER) method, over time, due to the anticipated application of phosphates on surface broadcast, in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS). Three sources of P were used (triple superphosphate, rock phosphate and magnesium thermophosphate), and three doses of P (60, 120 and 180 kg haâˆ’1 of P2O5) plus an unfertilized treatment (0 kg haâˆ’1 of P2O5) applied annually for 60 months. The soil samples collected in the 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, and 20 to 30 cm layers were evaluated P concentrations by extraction methods. The P concentrations increased over time with the application of water-soluble and insoluble sources in ICLS. The IER method proved to be more accurate as a soil P test, regardless of phosphate applied on surface broadcast. Â© 2021 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Advances in soil moisture retrieval from multispectral remote sensing using unoccupied aircraft systems and machine learning techniques
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - This study investigates the ability of machine learning models to retrieve the surface soil moisture of a grassland area from multispectral remote sensing carried out using an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS). In addition to multispectral images, we use terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model and hydrological variables of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as covariates to predict surface soil moisture. We tested four different machine learning algorithms and interrogated the models to rank the importance of different variables and to understand their relationship with surface soil moisture. All the machine learning algorithms we tested were able to predict soil moisture with good accuracy. The boosted regression tree algorithm was marginally the best, with a mean absolute error of 3.8 \% volumetric moisture content. Variable importance analysis revealed that the four most important variables were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.

TI  - Propagation of soil moisture sensing uncertainty into estimation of total soil water, evapotranspiration and irrigation decision-making
VL  - 243
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture sensors are subject to uncertainty (inaccuracy) in measuring soil water status, that hinders various applications. User groups (researchers and growers/advisers) rely on these sensors for estimating critical agricultural water management decisions and information such as total soil water in the crop root zone (TSW), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and predicting irrigation triggers (IT), i.e., when TSW is equal to or lower than readily available water. There is a lack of translation of errors in sensor-reported soil moisture (Î¸v) into TSW, ETc, and IT, which is critical to farm-level decision-making as well as research assessments. Nine soil moisture sensors (based on principles of time-domain reflectometry, capacitance and electrical resistance) were investigated in field conditions for silt loam and loamy sand soils under two installation orientations (vertical and horizontal) during two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Accurate representation of TSW, ETc, and IT was found to be a function of sensor-type, soil-type as well as calibration-type [factory calibration (F.C.) vs. site-specific calibration (S.S.C.)]. Sensor installation orientation did not affect sensor accuracy. Uncertainties in estimation of TSW, ETc and IT were quantified under each condition of use, and sensors were comparatively ranked for effective selection. It was found that all sensors underestimated ETc in silt loam soil. The deviation of sensor-measured ETc from true ETc ranged from âˆ’14 to âˆ’31 \%, which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil-vegetation system being monitored. Sensors showed both overstimation and underestimation of ETc in loamy sand soil with deviations of sensor-estimated ETc from true ETc ranging from 14 to âˆ’61 \%. The S.S.C. resulted in 45 and 17 \% improvement in TSW and ETc in silt loam soil, respectively, and 42, 80 and 86 \% improvement observed in TSW, IT and ETc in loamy sand soil, respectively. The research findings showed that suitability of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are used as criteria. These findings emphasize the need for evaluating soil moisture sensors based on practical and application-oriented criteria, in addition to reliance on Î¸v accuracy. To the best of authorsâ€™ knowledge, this research is the first to translate traditional Î¸v accuracy assessments into practical and application-oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications. Sensor rankings and uncertainty associated with their use presented here will allow diverse users to effectively identify sensors for targeted applications in water management decision-making and research.

TI  - Inversion of {Soil} {Moisture} on {Farmland} {Areas} {Based} on {SSA}-{CNN} {Using} {Multi}-{Source} {Remote} {Sensing} {Data
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a crucial factor in the field of meteorology, hydrology, and agricultural sciences. In agricultural production, surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for crop yield estimation and drought monitoring. For SSM inversion, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a trustworthy data source. However, for agricultural fields, the use of SAR data alone to invert SSM is susceptible to the influence of vegetation cover. In this paper, based on Sentinel-1 microwave remote sensing data and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, a convolution neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-CNN) was suggested to invert farmland SSM. The feature parameters were first extracted from pre-processed remote sensing data. Then, the correlation analysis between the extracted feature parameters and field measured SSM data was carried out, and the optimal combination of feature parameters for SSM inversion was selected as the input data of the subsequent models. To enhance the performance of the CNN, the hyper-parameters of CNN were optimized using SSA, and the SSA-CNN model was built for SSM inversion based on the obtained optimal hyper-parameter combination. Three typical machine learning approaches, including generalized regression neural network, random forest, and CNN, were used for comparison to show the efficacy of the suggested method. With an average coefficient of determination of 0.80, an average root mean square error of 2.17 vol.\%, and an average mean absolute error of 1.68 vol.\%, the findings demonstrated that the SSA-CNN model with the optimal feature combination had a better accuracy among the 4 models. In the end, the SSM of the study region was inverted throughout four phenological periods using the SSA-CNN model. The inversion results indicated that the suggested method performed well in local situations.

TI  - Soil moisture estimates over sporadically flooded farmlands: synergies and biases of remote sensing and in situ sources
VL  - 43
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological processes in ecosystems and regulates water and energy exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. Global coverage of surface soil moisture (SSM) satellite estimates makes them a fundamental source of information, while the validation of these estimates is usually based on in situ measurements, ideally from networks that cover areas similar to the satellite data resolution. However, as we expose in this study, both SSM data sources face challenges over extremely flat regions with large SSM variability. A homogenous farming region in the subhumid Pampas of Argentina, characterized by a large interannual rainfall variability as well as a marked annual cycle of rainfall and cropping, was taken as a case study. The region is almost devoid of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, is subject to large episodic flood and waterlogging events and holds an in situ network belonging to the Argentinean National Commission for Space Activities. This in situ network was set to evaluate the soil moisture estimated by satellite missions, such as SMAP and SAOCOM. However, several of these sites have been placed close to homesteads in a more uniform perennial vegetation than the prevailing seasonal crop. In this work, we examine how this placement bias influences SSM dynamics and its interpretation. We find that in situ data fails to capture the large seasonal and daily SSM variability caused by the cropping dynamics as well as the situation of waterlogging. As for the satellite SSM estimates, provided by the SMOS and SMAP missions in this study, while they capture the impact of cropping on SSM, data gaps can hinder robust statistical analysis. During periods of waterlogging, SSM values can lie outside the dynamic range considered valid by satellite missions, and thus are usually removed by users, creating `blind spots' for high soil water content stages in flood-prone lands. Our study underlines the importance of using multiple sources of information to interpret the hydrological status, including data from in situ measurements and remote sensing estimations of SSM as well as, when available, locally collected information such as reports from national, sub-national and private agro-industrial agencies.

TI  - Monitoring soil moisture content in the root zone of winter wheat with multi-angle multispectral imagery
VL  - 45
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - Exploring the impact of different monitoring angles from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the monitoring accuracy of soil moisture content (SMC) is crucial for precision irrigation. To this end, experiment was conducted to monitor the SMC of winter wheat at different growth stages under different irrigation treatments in Yangling, Shaanxi, China. At a solar zenith angle of 45 degrees, multispectral remote sensing data from a UAV were collected at thirteen different monitoring zenith angles. Simultaneously, the SMC in the wheat root zone was measured. From the UAV multispectral images, spectral reflectance was extracted for the construction of vegetation indices. Then the correlation between the vegetation indices and the measured SMC was analyzed. With the vegetation indices as input variables, SMC monitoring models were constructed using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Random Forest (RF), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The study also examined the effect of specific angles (hotspot and dark spot angles) on the estimation accuracy of the SMC at the nadir angle. The results indicated that different monitoring angles significantly impact the SMC estimation accuracy. Band reflectance and vegetation indices exhibited significant peak values and angular effects at the monitoring zenith angle of 45 degrees. The models achieved the optimal inversion accuracy at the hotspot angle (at a monitoring zenith angle of 45 degrees in the solar principal plane), and the accuracy was ranked as follows: BPNN (R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 1.69) {\textgreater} ELM (R-2 = 0.52; RMSE = 1.94) {\textgreater} RF (R-2 = 0.48; RMSE = 2.10). By eliminating shadows at the nadir angle through the threshold of dark spot, inversion accuracy similar to the hotspot direction is achieved. This study provides a basis for appropriate selection of UAV flight angles for the monitoring of SMC in the root zone of winter wheat.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The North China Plain is an important area for agricultural economic development in China. But water shortages, severe groundwater over-exploitation and drought problems make it difficult to exercise the topographic resource advantages of the plain. Therefore, the precise monitoring of soil moisture is of great significance for the rational use of water resources. Soil characteristics vary in natural farmland ecosystems, crops are constrained by multiple compound stresses and the precise extraction of soil moisture stress is a difficult and critical problem. The long time series was decomposed via complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to obtain different intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the statistical descriptors of each component were calculated to realize the precise discrimination of soil moisture stress. A quantitative evaluation model of soil moisture was established, and the different noise addition ratios and modeling types were set respectively to investigate the optimal inversion model. The results showed that: (1) The reconstruction error of the CEEMDAN was small and almost 0; it had a high reconstruction accuracy and was more suitable for the decomposition of the long time series. The first two components, IMF1 and IMF2, were soil moisture stress subsequences, and it could effectively reflect the moisture stress situation. (2) The inversion model performed well when epsilon was 0.05 and the model type was quadratic, with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.98, which gave a better fit and less error. (3) The overall soil moisture content in the study area was low, basically in the range of 6.9\% to 15.7\%, with the central part, especially the south-central part, being the most affected by soil moisture stress, and the overall impact of soil moisture stress showed a decreasing trend from February to May. The utilization of CEEMDAN further enhances the accuracy of soil moisture inversion in agricultural fields, realizing the effective application of remote sensing observation technology and time-frequency analysis technology in the field of soil moisture research.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - As a basic agricultural parameter in the formation, transformation, and consumption of surface water resources, soil moisture has a very important influence on the vegetation growth, agricultural production, and healthy operation of regional ecosystems. The Aksu river basin is a typical semi-arid agricultural area which seasonally suffers from water shortage. Due to the lack of knowledge on soil moisture change, the water management and decision-making processes have been a difficult issue for local government. Therefore, soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing became a reasonable way to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Compared to in situ measurements, the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of soil water content is convenient and can be repetitively applied over a large area. To verify the applicability of the typical drought index to the rapid acquisition of soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions, this study simulated, compared, and validated the effectiveness of soil moisture inversion. GF-1 WFV images, Landsat 8 OLI images, and the measured soil moisture data were used to determine the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), and the Vegetation Adjusted Perpendicular Drought Index (VAPDI). First, the determination coefficients of the correlation analyses on the PDI, MPDI, VAPDI, and measured soil moisture in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth layers based on the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI images were good. Notably, in the 0-10 cm depth layers, the average determination coefficient was 0.68; all models met the accuracy requirements of soil moisture inversion. Both indicated that the drought indices based on the Near Infrared (NIR)-Red spectral space derived from the optical remote sensing images are more sensitive to soil moisture near the surface layer; however, the accuracy of retrieving the soil moisture in deep layers was slightly lower in the study area. Second, in areas of vegetation coverage, MPDI and VAPDI had a higher inversion accuracy than PDI. To a certain extent, they overcame the influence of mixed pixels on the soil moisture spectral information. VAPDI modified by Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) was not susceptible to vegetation saturation and, thus, had a higher inversion accuracy, which makes it performs better than MPDI's in vegetated areas. Third, the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture retrieved by the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI image were similar. However, the GF-1 WFV images were more sensitive to changes in the soil moisture, which reflected the actual soil moisture level covered by different vegetation. These results provide a practical reference for the dynamic monitoring of surface soil moisture, obtaining agricultural information and agricultural condition parameters in arid and semi-arid regions.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Inland open water bodies often pose a systematic error source in the passive remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture. Water temperature is a necessary variable used to compute water emissions that is required to be subtracted from satellite observation to yield actual emissions from the land portion, which in turn generates accurate soil moisture retrievals. Therefore, overestimation of soil moisture can often be corrected using concurrent water temperature data in the overall mitigation procedure. In recent years, several data sets of lake water temperature have become available, but their specifications and accuracy have rarely been investigated in the context of passive soil moisture remote sensing on a global scale. For this reason, three lake temperature products were evaluated against in-situ measurements from 2007 to 2011. The data sets include the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) from Global Observatory of Lake Responses to Environmental Change (GloboLakes), the Copernicus Global Land Operations Cryosphere and Water (C-GLOPS), as well as the lake mix-layer temperature (LMLT) from the European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 Land Reanalysis. GloboLakes, C-GLOPS, and ERA5 Land have overall comparable performance with Pearson correlations (R) of 0.87, 0.92 and 0.88 in comparison with in-situ measurements. LSWT products exhibit negative median biases of -0.27 K (GloboLakes) and -0.31 K (C-GLOPS), whereas the median bias of LMLT is 1.56 K. When mapped from their respective native resolutions to a common 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grid 2.0 projection, similar relative performance was observed. LMLT and LSWT data are closer in performance over the 9 km grid cells that exhibit a small range of lake cover fractions (0.05-0.5). Despite comparable relative performance, ERA5 Land shows great advantages in spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In summary, an integrated evaluation on data accuracy, long-term availability, global coverage, temporal resolution, and regular forward processing with modest data latency led us to conclude that LMLT from the ERA5 Land Reanalysis product represents the most optimal path for use in the development of a long-term soil moisture product.

TI  - An improved change detection method for high-resolution soil moisture mapping in permafrost regions
VL  - 61
SN  - 1548-1603
AB  - Soil moisture plays a crucial role in understanding the hydrological cycle and the ecological environment. This research presents an improved change detection method that leverages time series data from Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical sensors (2019-2021) to estimate surface soil moisture. The response of backscatter to soil moisture in bare soil was expressed in a logarithmic form, and the influence function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the backscatter difference was established for various vegetation-covered surfaces. Therefore, the impact of vegetation on backscatter is effectively mitigated, and the resulting change in backscatter relative to bare soil conditions can be obtained. An empirical function is subsequently formulated to ascertain the reference values of soil moisture in each pixel. The retrieval of soil moisture is demonstrated in the Wudaoliang permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and validated against ground measurements. The retrieval results of the improved change detection method exhibit correlation coefficients ranging from 0.672 to 0.941, with root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.031 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3 to 0.073 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3. Compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9-km product, our new method demonstrates higher correlation (0.898 vs. 0.867) and lower RMSE (0.037 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3 vs. 0.044{\textbackslash} \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3). The soil moisture retrieved from Sentinel shows a strong correlation with the SMAP 9-km soil moisture in the time series, thereby providing a better representation of the region's soil moisture heterogeneity. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of combining Sentinel-1 and 2 for high-resolution (100 m) soil moisture mapping in permafrost regions.

TI  - Temporal {Calibration} of an {Evaporation}-{Based} {Spatial} {Disaggregation} {Method} of {SMOS} {Soil} {Moisture} {Data
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The resolution of current satellite surface soil moisture (SM) estimates is very low, of tens of kilometers, which proves to be insufficient for various agricultural and hydrological applications. Amongst the existing downscaling approaches of remotely sensed SM, DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on a Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) improves the resolution of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture data using soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimates at high resolution (HR) and a SEE(SM) model implemented at low resolution (LR). Defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation, SEE can be derived from the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The current version of DISPATCH uses a linear SEE(SM) model. This study aims at improving the SEE(SM) model and testing different calibration strategies, to ultimately have more robust and better downscaled SM products. A nonlinear SEE(SM) model is introduced and its influence on the derived HR SM products is studied over a range of conditions. Each model, linear and nonlinear, is calibrated from remote sensing data on a daily and a multi-date basis. The approaches were tested over two mixed dry and irrigated areas in Catalonia, Spain, and over one dry area in Morocco. When using the linear model, better statistical results were generally obtained using a daily calibration (current version of DISPATCH), most notably over one Spanish site. However, the best results were systematically obtained for an annually calibrated nonlinear model, in terms of all metrics considered: correlation coefficient, slope of the linear regression, bias, unbiased root mean square error. In particular, when using the annually calibrated nonlinear SEE (SM) model, the temporal slope of the linear regression between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture increased to 1.16 and 0.75 for one Spanish site and for the Moroccan site (as opposed to 0.44 and 0.58, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). The temporal correlation coefficient increased to 0.47 and 0.54 over the Spanish sites (as opposed to 0.18 and 0.27, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). Those contrasted results indicate compensation effects between the model type and the calibration strategy. Taking into account studies that report the strong nonlinear behavior of the SEE with respect to SM, the introduction of the nonlinear SEE(SM) model in DISPATCH, combined with a multi-date calibration, is proven to perform significantly better under various conditions, leading to more robust disaggregated SM products. The SEE modeling based on the nonlinear SM model, with a multi-date calibration, could be integrated into the CATDS-Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS as a future product, as well as into existing evapotranspiration models, which are based on a combination of thermal and microwave data.

TI  - A spatial downscaling method for {SMAP} soil moisture considering vegetation memory and spatiotemporal fusion
VL  - 17
SN  - 1753-8947
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the hydrological cycle, drought monitoring, and water resources management. However, passive microwave remote sensing products offer coarse spatial resolutions (approximately 25-40 km), greatly limiting their applications. In this study, we considered vegetation memory and increased the amount of vegetation data by spatiotemporal fusion, integrated lagged vegetation index and fusion data as model inputs, and downscaled the spatial resolution of SMAP SM using the Random Forest (RF) model as well as multi-source remote sensing data. The downscaled SM was validated with 30 in situ SM measurements and daily precipitation data and explored the contributions of NDVI(lagged )and NDVIfused in downscaling. The results show that the downscaled SM is highly consistent with the in situ SM measurements. The correlation ranges from 0.628 to 0.849 with an average of 0.689. The root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 0.024 to 0.094 m(3)/m(3) with an average of 0.057 m3/m3. The proposed method leverages the strengths of the RF model, fusion vegetation data, and lagged vegetation data to improve high-resolution SM accuracy.

AB  - Soil moisture controls the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere and is a significant factor affecting plant growth and productivity. Hyperspectral monitoring of soil water fraction could provide a theoretical basis for real-time estimation of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture. To quantitatively evaluate the hyperspectral monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC): the SMC and its corresponding spectral reflectance were measured in the laboratory. In addition, the original spectral data was pre-processed by single and multiple transformations to study the effect of spectral preprocessing methods on the quantitative evaluation of soil moisture. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) was used to extract the corresponding wavelengths of soil moisture and the spectral monitoring model was established by using the partial least squares (PLS). The results show that (1) SMC and spectral reflectance show an obvious negative correlation, and the spectral reflectance gradually decreases with the increase of SMC. (2) Appropriate pretreatment methods can improve the correlation between SMC and spectral reflectance and improve the accuracy of the SMC monitoring model, of which T19 (R2 + SNV + FD) is the best spectral pretreatment method. (3) The optimal SMC monitoring model is T19-SPA-PLS (R2v = 0.986, RMSEv = 1.824, RPD = 8.239). This study provided a reference for spectral data processing and an effective method for the accurate estimation of SMC using hyperspectral remote sensing. Â© 2022, ALÃ–KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

TI  - Assessing capacitance soil moisture sensor probesâ€™ ability to sense nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium using volumetric ion content
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate and near real-time volumetric soil water and volumetric ion content (VIC) measurements can both inform precise irrigation scheduling and aid in fertilizer management applications in cropping systems. To assist in the monitoring of these measurements, capacitance-based soil moisture probes are used in agricultural best management practice (BMP) programs. However, the ability of these sensors to detect nutrients in the soil sourced from fertilizers is not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of a capacitance-based soil moisture probe in detecting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) movement in the soil. To achieve this, a laboratory-based setup was established using pure sand soil cores. Raw soil moisture and VIC probe readings from the cores were contrasted across multiple N, P, and K rates. The N treatments applied were rates of 0, 112, 168, and 224 kg/ha; for P, were 0, 3.76, and 37.6 kg/ha, and for K were 0, 1.02, 1.53, and 2.04 kg/ha. Each nutrient was evaluated separately using a randomized complete block design experiment with three replications for N and K, and 5 replications for P. The impact of each nutrient rate on the sensitivity of VIC readings was determined by evaluating differences in three points of the time series, including the observed maximum point, inflection point, and convergence value as well as the time of occurrence of those points over a 24-hour period. These points were assessed at depths 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 cm. The findings of this study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture probesâ€™ responsiveness to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its sensitivity to changes in N and P rates is comparatively lower. The results obtained in this study can be used to develop fertilizer management protocols that utilize K movement as the baseline to indirectly assess N and P, while helping to inform those who currently use the probe which nutrients the probe may be detecting. The probesâ€™ readings could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation and nutrient management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient management.

TI  - A 1 km daily soil moisture dataset over {China} using in situ measurement and machine learning
VL  - 14
SN  - 1866-3508
AB  - High-quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, while the recent reanalysis and remote sensing soil moisture data are often available at coarse resolution and remote sensing data are only for the surface soil. Here, we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained by the in situ measurements of 1789 stations over China, named SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China by in situ data, version 1.0). Random forest is used as a robust machine learning approach to predict soil moisture using ERA5-Land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as predictors. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2000-2020. Using in situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the estimation accuracy of SMCI1.0: year-to-year (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041 to 0.052 and R ranges from 0.883 to 0.919) and station-to-station experiments (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045 to 0.051 and R ranges from 0.866 to 0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture are often located in the North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to study the spatial-temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in situ data, it can be a useful complement to existing model-based and satellite-based soil moisture datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and models. The DOI link for the dataset is http://dx.doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.272415 (Shangguan et al., 2022).

TI  - Application of a monopole antenna probe with an optimized flange diameter for tdr soil moisture measurement
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil volumetric water content (Î¸) is a parameter describing one of the most important factors conditioning proper plant growth. Monitoring soil moisture is of particular importance in the rational use of water resources for irrigation, especially during periods of water scarcity. This paper presents a method of measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system by means of a probe designed to be mounted on a mobile device used for precise plant irrigation. Due to the specific field conditions of the measurement, the design of the probe was proposed as a monopole antenna. Electromagnetic simulations of the probe were carried out with Ansys HFSS software to optimise its dimensions. Then a prototype of the probe was manufactured to conduct laboratory measurements with the use of a vector network analyser (VNA) working in the 20 kHz to 8 GHz frequency range. The VNA analyser was configured to work in the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) mode. From measurements of the time distance between reflections from the probeâ€™s elements it is possible to calculate the bulk dielectric permittivity of the soil surrounding the probe. Next, based on commonly used soil moisture dielectric calibrations one can determine Î¸ of the soil sample. The paper presents simulation results and laboratory tests of an antenna probe. Due to its tough and durable design, this type of probe gives the possibility of easy application in field conditions, which makes it especially suitable for mechanically demanding measurement systems. As the sensitivity zone is comparatively large, this probe is well-suited to measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system. Â© 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In recent decades, microwave remote sensing (RS) has been used to measure soil moisture (SM). Long-term and large-scale RS SM datasets derived from various microwave sensors have been used in environmental fields. Understanding the accuracies of RS SM products is essential for their proper applications. However, due to the mismatched spatial scale between the ground-based and RS observations, the truth at the pixel scale may not be accurately represented by ground-based observations, especially when the spatial density of in situ measurements is low. Because ground-based observations are often sparsely distributed, temporal upscaling was adopted to transform a few in situ measurements into SM values at a pixel scale of 1 km by introducing the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) related to SM. The upscaled SM showed high consistency with in situ SM observations and could accurately capture rainfall events. The upscaled SM was considered as the reference data to evaluate RS SM products at different spatial scales. In regard to the validation results, in addition to the correlation coefficient (R) of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM being slightly lower than that of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM, SMAP had the best performance in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE and bias, followed by the CCI. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) products were in worse agreement with the upscaled SM and were inferior to the R value of the X-band SM of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). In conclusion, in the study area, the SMAP and CCI SM are more reliable, although both products were underestimated by 0.060 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.077 cm(3) cm(-3,) respectively. If the biases are corrected, then the improved SMAP with an RMSE of 0.043 cm(3) cm(-3) and the CCI with an RMSE of 0.039 cm(3) cm(-3) will hopefully reach the application requirement for an accuracy with an RMSE less than 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3).

VL  - 47
SN  - 0255-660X
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture provides insight into larger-scale hydrological processes and can, therefore, help in improving hydrological predictions. The strength of remote sensing for mapping surface soil moisture is well proven. In addition, data assimilation offers the opportunity to combine the advantages of modelling with those of remote sensing data to achieve higher accuracy and continuous improvement in hydrological forecasts. In this study, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation science soil moisture product was assimilated into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model using Kalman filter data assimilation technique. Further, the updated multilayer spatio-temporal soil moisture distributions across the Mahanadi Basin, India, were simulated using the hydrological model. The VIC model was set up and parameterized using field-observed and remote sensing-derived data. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the model, the `four-parameter' (Tmax, Tmin, Prec, and WS) meteorological forcing scenario was selected as the operational scenario. The output fluxes obtained from VIC were routed to simulate discharge at five stations for the calibration and validation of the model. With R-2 and model efficiency values close to 0.95 and 0.99, respectively, the model was proven to be suitable for simulating the hydrological responses of the basin. Soil moisture was assimilated in the top soil layer of the model using the Kalman filter approach, and the multilayer soil moisture regime was generated using the modelling approach. The validation of soil moisture (assimilated) products proves that these products are better than remote sensing and traditionally modelled soil moisture products, in both spatial and temporal domains in terms of availability and accuracy.

TI  - Delineation of management zones for site-specific information about soil fertility characteristics through proximal sensing of potato fields
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - The delineation of management zones (MZs) has been suggested as a solution to mitigate adverse impacts of soil variability on potato tuber yield. This study quantified the spatial patterns of variability in soil and crop properties to delineate MZs for site-specific soil fertility characterization of potato fields through proximal sensing of fields. Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil moisture content (Î¸), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and crop that explained 71 to 86\% of within-field variability. The cluster analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as excellent, medium, and poor at a 40\% similarity level. The coefficient of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study.

TI  - Surface soil moisture estimation at high spatial resolution by fusing synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing data
VL  - 14
SN  - 1931-3195
AB  - The difficulty of accurate and large-scale measurement for surface parameters limits the regional surface soil moisture (SSM) estimation using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Moreover, the coarse resolution of soil moisture products generated by existing methods, which fuse SAR and passive microwave products, cannot fully satisfy the requirement of specific regional applications. To solve this problem, an SAR-optical data fusion method for soil moisture estimation (SOFSME) based on a cascade neural network is proposed in this study. SOFSME obtains surface parameters from historical soil moisture images and related environmental images to estimate a SSM image with high resolution at large scale from Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data. Validation experiments in single and multiple land-use type areas showed that the SOFSME performed best on bare soil areas with a median root mean square error of 0.0203. The median universal image quality index of estimated soil moisture image was 0.1454, which was better for single cropland areas than multi-land-use type areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a median value of 0.7645 in both experiments. These results showed that the SOFSME had high accuracy, availability, and stability in regional soil moisture estimation. Compared with existing methods, the SOFSME can provide high-quality soil moisture images and does not directly depend on field measurement data. Thus, the proposed SOFSME method is of great value for high-resolution soil moisture estimation in more regional applications. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Accurate statistical seasonal streamflow forecasts developed by incorporating remote sensing soil moisture and terrestrial water storage anomaly information
VL  - 626
SN  - NA
AB  - Water managers need improved seasonal streamflow forecasts in drought-prone regions like the U.S. Great Plains, where the inter-annual variability in rainfall and streamflow is high and seasonal streamflow forecasting systems are not well developed. Recent research has demonstrated that in-situ soil moisture measurements can be used to produce accurate streamflow forecasts in the Great Plains where rainfall runoff is the predominant source of streamflow. However, an inadequate density of in-situ soil moisture monitoring locations makes producing such forecasts impossible in many locations. Therefore, our objective was to develop and quantify the accuracy of seasonal streamflow forecasts for rainfall-dominated watersheds using remotely sensed data. Precipitation and remotely sensed soil moisture and terrestrial water storage anomaly data were incorporated into a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts for five watersheds in the Great Plains. The best MLR models had Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.71 to 0.93, indicating good to very good model performance. In one watershed with nearby in-situ soil moisture data, the use of remotely sensed soil moisture data led to greater forecast accuracy than did the inclusion of the sparse in-situ data. Our results show that the use of remote sensing data in MLR models can provide accurate seasonal streamflow forecasts in rainfall-dominated regions which currently lack such information.

TI  - Spatialâ€“temporal modeling of root zone soil moisture dynamics in a vineyard using machine learning and remote sensing
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - High-resolution spatialâ€“temporal root zone soil moisture (RZSM) information collected at different scales is useful for a variety of agricultural, hydrologic, and climate applications. RZSM can be estimated using remote sensing, empirical equations, or process-based simulation models. Machine learning (ML) approaches for evaluating RZSM across numerous spatialâ€“temporal scales are less generalizable than process-based models. However, data-driven ML approaches offer a unique opportunity to develop complex models of soil moisture without making assumptions about the processes governing soil water dynamics in a given study region. In this study, comparisons were made between two models, pySEBAL and EFSOIL, which were based on evaporation fraction (EF) and soil properties, and a data-driven model based on the Random Forest (RF) ensemble algorithm. These approaches were evaluated to demonstrate their capabilities for RZSM estimation. The EF obtained from Landsat images was used after validation with eddy covariance measurements as the major input to all three models, along with other meteorological and soil physical properties. The RF model was trained using in situ soil moisture data from Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors installed in a vineyard from 2018 to 2020. The predictor variables comprised of meteorological, soil properties, EF, and a vegetation index. The results reveal that there was a strong correlation between the in situ measured soil moisture and the RF predicted soil moisture at all sensor locations. Due to the complexity of the physical processes involved in soil water flow, the empirical models pySEBAL and EFSOIL were unable to reliably predict RZSM values at all monitored locations. The high RZSM predicted by pySEBAL demonstrated the presence of possible bias in the modelâ€™s algorithm used to estimate soil moisture. We also demonstrated that ML based on the RF algorithm may be used to predict spatially distributed RZSM when a few soil moisture ground measurements are combined with remote sensing to produce soil moisture maps.

TI  - Experimental validation of the soil fertility hypothesis in a natural {Mediterranean} tri-trophic system
VL  - 169
SN  - NA
AB  - Host plant resources are a major issue in gall-insect ecology. Soil fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that were not fertilized (â€˜poor soilâ€™) and others that were fertilized with NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions. Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on galling-insect ecology. Â© 2021 The Netherlands Entomological Society

TI  - Using multimodal remote sensing data to estimate regional-scale soil moisture content: {A} case study of {Beijing}, {China
VL  - 260
SN  - NA
AB  - An accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content (SMC) is important for water management and drought monitoring. Traditional ground measurement methods of SMC are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale. The development of remote sensing (RS) technology provides a cost-effective tool for estimating SMC at regional scale. However, the estimation of SMC by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the way in which vegetation types, fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) and soil layer depth affect the SMC-estimation performance remains unclear. Therefore, the objectives in this study are to (1) evaluate the SMC-estimation performance provided by Landsat-8 data and random forest regression (RFR) algorithm; (2) discuss the accuracy of RS-based method for SMC estimation at different soil layer depths, and (3) explore how vegetation types and FVC affect the performance of SMC-estimation. The results can be summarized as: (1) the SMC estimation performance of multispectral (MS)- and thermal infrared (TIR)-based indices single used were comparable, in which TIR-based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while MS-based indices performed better in deep soil layer. Generally, MS- and TIR-based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used. (2) the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating SMC decreased with soil depth. (3) the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types. Moreover, the SMC estimation in moderate vegetation coverage (FVC ranged from 0.3 to 0.5) was best. These results indicate that RS-based multimodal data combined with RFR could provide relatively repeatable and accurate SMC estimation. This approach can thus be used for the regional SMC monitoring and water resources management. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Investigating the {Efficacy} of the {SMAP} {Downscaled} {Soil} {Moisture} {Product} for {Drought} {Monitoring} {Based} on {Information} {Theory
VL  - 15
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) information can be routinely obtained from high-quality microwave retrievals at a global scaleâ€”such as datasets generated by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. In this article, using mutual information (MI) theory, we investigate the efficacy of the downscaled SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 3-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL2) for the detection of agricultural drought over northwestern China. The SPL2 is generated by merging SMAP enhanced radiometer data with Sentinel-1 radar observations. To evaluate the efficiency of the SPL2 downscaled algorithm, the SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer 9-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL3) is also utilized as a non-downscaled baseline. Over croplands, comparing normalized MI (NMI) values sampled between the NDVI time series and 3-km Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient (Ïƒ) from SPL2 with NMI values between NDVI and SPL3 radiometer brightness temperature (Tb; resampled to 3-km resolution), we find that the Sentinel-1 Ïƒ explains more (3-km) NDVI information than the SPL3 Tb, as the NMI between Ïƒvh (Ïƒvv) and NDVI is 15\% (8\%), larger than that between SPL3 Tb and NDVI (5\%). However, compared to the SPL3 Tb baseline, the information from downscaled SPL2 Tb on NDVI is reduced by approximately 3\%, and the SPL2 algorithm extracts only 7\% (10\%) of the total information available from both enhanced SPL3 Tb and Sentinel-1 Ïƒvh (Ïƒvv). Overall, the C-band Ïƒ signal provides valuable information for vegetation monitoring due to its frequency advantage. However, additional efforts should be focused on SPL2 merging algorithms to improve the value of the downscaled SPL2 product for agricultural applications.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) soil moisture (SM) products have been widely used in various environmental studies. Understanding the error structure of data is necessary to properly apply RS SM products in trend and variation analysis and data fusion. However, a spatially continuous assessment of RS SM datasets is impeded by the limited spatial distribution of ground-based observations. As an alternative, the RS apparent thermal inertia (ATI) data related to the SM are transformed into SM values to expand the validation space. To obtain error components, the ATI-based SM along with the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM are applied with the triple-collocation (TC) method to evaluate the RS SM data regarding random errors and amplitude variances at the regional scale. When the ATI-based SM is regarded as the reference data, the amplitude biases of the other two datasets are determined. The mean bias is also estimated by calculating the mean value difference between the ATI-based and validated RS SM. The results show that the ATI-based SM is a reliable source of reference data that, when combined with the TC method, can correctly estimate the error structure of RS SM datasets in wide space, promoting the reasonable application and calibration of RS SM datasets.

TI  - Evaluation of push-pull technology for pest and soil fertility management on maize in north western {Ethiopia
VL  - 19
SN  - 1125-4718
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) production in north western Ethiopia is severely constrained by the parasitic weed striga (Striga hermontica), the stemborer (Busseola fusca) pest, and poor soil fertility due to continuous mono cropping. An intercropping system known as push-pull technology is a novel soil and pest management strategy for improving soil fertility and controlling agricultural pests by using repellent â€œpushâ€ plants (such as desmodium, Desmodium intortum) and trap â€œpullâ€ plants (such as napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum). The aims of the study were (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of the push-pull technology against stemborer and striga infestation, (ii) to investigate the impact of the push-pull technology on improving grain yield, and (iii) to assess effect of the pushpull technology on soil fertility. The study was conducted in 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons in 3 districts in north western Ethiopia. Three farmers from each district, who practiced the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two treatments (plots): a push-pull technology (PPT) and maize monocrop (MC) treatments. Data were collected on the percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, the number of striga plants that emerged, plant height, grain yield, available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), organic matter (OM) and bulk density (BD). There were significant reduction in stemborer damage (2.8 \%) and striga count (4.1 Striga plants/m2) in the push-pull treatment compared to the maize monocrop plots (15.4 \% and 21.8 striga plants/m2, respectively). Maize plant height (2.34 m) and grain yield (5.3 t ha-1) were significantly higher in the push-pull plots as compared to the sole crop (1.9 m and 3.0 t ha-1, respectively). Similarly, there were significantly higher P (20.06 mg/kg soil), K (406.86 mg/kg soil), TN (2.5 g/kg soil), OC (42.9 g/kg soil), OM (73.8 g/kg soil) levels considered to be moderate to high fertility status in the push-pull as compared to monocrop plots (11.17 mg/kg soil, 347.93 mg/kg soil, 1.6 g/kg soil, 29.8 g/kg soil, and 51.2 g/kg soil, respectively) which is rated from low to moderate soil fertility level. Moreover, bulk density was significantly lower in PPT (0.92 g/cm3) than in MC (0.95 g/cm3) plots. This suggests that push pull technology is effective in reducing striga and stemborer damage and improves soil fertility status which results in better grain yield.

VL  - 133
SN  - NA
AB  - For effective measurement and collection of soil moisture information an electronic system has been designed and developed. Since soil water holding capacity varies depending on the soil structure so a sensor probe is designed with a sensing system for efficient detection of moisture in the soil. The capacitive sensor probe is designed to detect a change of capacitance response from 15 to 1200pF. According to this change of capacitance response, a series RLC network is designed to find out an optimum frequency for efficient sensing of moisture. The designed sensor probe is calibrated for three different types of soil (silt/sandy/clay) using Thermogravimetric (TG) Analysis. To process the sensing data, DataLogger (DL) algorithm has been developed and programmed in an ARM controller for monitoring and storing of data on server using IoT (Internet of Things). For the designed sensing circuit, an optimum frequency of 218 kHz is found out from the resonance curve. At this frequency, the response of electronic interfacing circuit is observed in terms of capacitance and voltage. Data obtained from linear analysis (R square: 0.99, Pearsonâ€™s r: 0.99) shows that the designed sensor system responds appreciably to the moisture change.

TI  - A stepwise method for downscaling {SMAP} soil moisture dataset in the {CONUS} during 2015â€“2019
VL  - 130
SN  - NA
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) product, which delivers spatially continuous soil moisture (SM) data with reliable accuracy, has been widely used in ecologically and hydrologically related studies. However, the active radar of SMAP failed after operation for approximate three months, leading to the loss of the original 3 km (called A3) and 9 km (called AP9) SMAP SM dataset afterwards. Since merely the 36 km SMAP dataset (called P36 in this research) is available up to now, the relatively coarse spatial resolution is difficult to meet the requirement for monitoring at the regional scale. In this paper, the 36 km SMAP SM dataset in the conterminous United States (CONUS) was downscaled to 3 km after the failure of the active radar. To reduce the great uncertainty in downscaling (i.e., a process from 36 km to 3 km directly), a stepwise strategy was proposed. Specifically, our currently published 9 km SMAP SM dataset (called VIP9, from April 2015 to December 2019) was used as input for downscaling, which was downscaled to 3 km by fusion with auxiliary data (e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) at fine spatial resolution based on area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK). Furthermore, a random forest (RF)-based correction process was developed to enhance the quality of the downscaled SM dataset by fusing with the ground-based SM data (i.e., in-situ data). As a result, a 16-day composited SM dataset at 3 km spatial resolution was produced from 2015 to 2019, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) and unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) in temporal (spatial) validation of 0.888 (0.912) and 0.021 (0.023), respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the AP9 dataset (although only available in the three months) is helpful to increase the accuracy of downscaling. Moreover, the difference between satellite- and ground-based SM data can be further reduced through the correction process. The produced 3 km SMAP SM dataset has great potential to extend the defunct A3 data and support related studies. The contributions of the paper are twofold, including the development of the stepwise method for downscaling and the generation of the 3 km SMAP SM dataset in the CONUS during 2015â€“2019.

TI  - Assessment of {SMAP} and {SMOS} soil moisture products using triple collocation method over {Inner} {Mongolia
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring and weather forecast. L-band is found to be the most suitable band for retrieving surface SM. Here, we evaluate two L-band passive microwave SM products Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in Inner Mongolia. The collected in-situ data from 24 measured sites and the triple collocation (TC) analysis method (using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) SM data as a reference dataset) are used to evaluate SMAP and SMOS SM products. In the validation based on in-situ SM, SMAP shows the highest correlation with the in-situ SM, followed by GLDAS and SMOS. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias value of SMAP is the lowest. The validation results of each in-situ station show that the median correlation coefficient of ASCAT is the highest, followed by SMAP, GLDAS, and SMOS. The median RMSE and bias of SMAP are the lowest, while SMOS performs the worst among the three products. TC analysis results show that SMAP has better performance with the majority of the random errors distributed between 0.02 and 0.03 m3/m3. The average random error of SMAP is small, while SMOS has relatively large random errors. Simultaneously, SMAP performs better than GLDAS and SMOS in grassland and low vegetation coverage areas. The research results and analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for improving the quality of SM products. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - An observation-driven optimization method for continuous estimation of soil moisture over large heterogeneous areas
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - In most remote sensing-based soil moisture (SM) retrieval methods, in-situ SM measurements are commonly used for validation purposes. Few studies have investigated whether such measurements can be used for calibration. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method was proposed to estimate SM from remote sensing observations. Specifically, the optimization method was developed within the surface temperature-vegetation index (TVX) framework for the definition of objective function and constraints. In-situ SM measurements were used to optimize the theoretical boundaries of the TVX feature space. We demonstrated the applicability of the new method with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States of America. Results indicate that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has reached a level comparable with those produced by traditional methods. Moreover, the method has not only bypassed the complex parameterization of aerodynamic and surface resistance but also achieved continuous monitoring of SM. That is just the capacity that the traditional TVX method does not possess. Therefore, although our optimization method requires the ancillary of in-situ observations, its simplicity proves that it is a useful tool for a quick and continuous monitoring of SM over large heterogeneous areas.

TI  - Applicability of cosmic-ray neutron sensor for measuring soil moisture at the agricultural-pastoral ecotone in northwest {China
VL  - 63
SN  - 1674-7313
AB  - Accurate monitoring of soil moisture is crucial in hydrological and ecological studies. Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) measure area-average soil moisture at field scale, filling a spatial scale gap betweenin-situobservations and remote sensing measurements. However, its applicability has not been assessed in the agricultural-pastoral ecotone, a data scarce semi-arid and arid region in Northwest China (APENC). In this study, we calibrated and assessed the CRNS (the standardN(0)method) estimates of soil moisture. Results show that Pearson correlation coefficient,R-P, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the CRNS soil moisture and the gravimetric soil moisture are 0.904 and less than 0.016 m(3)m(-3), respectively, indicating that the CRNS is able to estimate the area-average soil moisture well at our study site. Compared with thein-situsensor network measurements (ECH2O sensors), the CRNS is more sensitive to the changes in moisture in its footprint, which overestimates and underestimates the soil moisture under precipitation and dry conditions, respectively. The three shape parametersa(0),a(1),a(2)in the standard calibration equation (N(0)method) are not well suited to the study area. The calibrated parameters improved the accuracy of the CRNS soil moisture estimates. Due to the lack of low gravimetric soil moisture data, performance of the calibratedN(0)function is still poor in the extremely dry conditions. Moreover, aboveground biomass including vegetation biomass, canopy interception and widely developed biological soil crusts adds to the uncertainty of the CRNS soil moisture estimates. Such biomass impacts need to be taken into consideration to further improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimation by the CRNS in the data scarce areas such as agricultural-pastoral ecotone in Northwest China.

TI  - Downscaling {SMAP} soil moisture using a wide \& deep learning method over the {Continental} {United} {States
VL  - 609
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring, agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals (approximately 25â€“55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications. In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the Wide \& Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer SM product (L3\_SM\_P). In this method, horizontally and vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv, respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST), topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the SMAP SM (L3\_SM\_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km. Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715. The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to 0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamics of soil water content using field monitoring and {AI}: {A} case study of a vegetated soil in an urban environment in {China
VL  - 28
SN  - NA
AB  - Maintenance of green infrastructure requires persistent monitoring of soil water content, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature and relative humidity (RH). There is need to create relation among these parameters to deduce soil water content as to limit cost of introducing sensors. The present investigation means to measure the progression of these four parameters in a green infrastructure site in an urban landscape and to additionally create correlations among them. An incorporated field testing and statistical modeling approach is embraced to accomplish the objective. Four sites including bare, grassed and treed soil are chosen for examination. Field monitoring was first directed to monitor the above mentioned four parameters for two months. This is trailed by statistical modeling using artificial intelligence (AI) approach (i.e., artificial neutral networks (ANN)). Correlations are created for evaluating soil water content as function of EC, RH and temperature for the four sites. Regardless of the sort of cover, EC is strongly correlated to soil water content, followed by RH and soil temperature. The correlation of EC is strongest in vegetated soil when compared with bare soil. The relationship of soil temperature with water content of soil do not have a decisive pattern. Ensuring drying of soils does not increase temperature fundamentally after precipitation. Uncertainty investigation additionally presumes that water content of soil follows normal distribution function in treed soils, while it follows skewed distribution in the cases of grassed and bare soils.

VL  - 2022
SN  - NA
AB  - The combination of wireless sensor networks and radio technology can form a new type of communication network. The emergence of wireless sensor networks has effectively solved the problems existing in radio technology, but traditional wireless sensor networks and radio technology networks cannot be directly applied to wireless sensors. On this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil nutrient variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of statistical quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a given location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze the relationship between several natural factors and quantitative estimation of soil protection. Based on wireless sensor technology, this paper studies the variability of farmland soil nutrients and statistical quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a foundation for the development of agriculture and statistics.

TI  - Mesoscale soil moisture survey by mobile cosmic-ray neutron sensor across various landscapes in the {Heihe} {River} {Basin
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - The cosmic-ray neutron technology is a novel method for upscaling soil moisture, holding significant importance in drought monitoring, soil water storage estimation, calibration of remote sensing products, and data assimilation of land surface models. However, most studies conducted soil moisture measurement experiments using static Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensors (CRNS) and are often limited to a single landscape, lacking in-situ measurement for the cosmic-ray neutron rover across various landscapes. This study carried out soil moisture observation experiments using a cosmic-ray neutron rover in nine grassland plots, nine farmland plots, and nine desert plots of the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China. The neutron counts displayed clear variations among different plots, and an equation could represent the relationship between neutron intensity and multiple variables near the ground. The parameter N0 was the smallest for grassland and greatest for desert, and there was a significant negative correlation between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and N0 (P {\textless}0.05). Furthermore, the performance of CRNS notably improved after considering soil lattice water and soil organic matter. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the measured and oven-dried soil moisture increased with radius. Soil moisture measured by CRNS strongly supported the 100 m diameter footprint assumption (RMSE {\textless}0.044 g/g). The study offers valuable insights into the application and promotion of cosmic-ray neutron technology across various landscapes within a basin.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Spaceborne GNSS-R technology is a new remote sensing method for soil moisture monitoring. Focusing on the significant influence of water on the surface reflectivity of CYGNSS, this paper improved the removal method of water influence according to the spatial resolution of CYGNSS data. Due to the disturbance effect of the incident angle, microwave frequency and soil type on the Fresnel reflection coefficient in surface reflectivity, a normalization method of Fresnel reflection coefficient was proposed after analyzing the data characteristics of variables in the Fresnel reflection coefficient. Finally, combined with the soil moisture retrieval method of linear equation, the accuracy was compared and verified by using measured data, SMAP products and official CYGNSS products. The results indicate that the normalization method of the Fresnel reflection coefficient could effectively reduce the influence of relevant parameters on the Fresnel reflection coefficient, but the normalization effect became worse at large incident angles (greater than 65 \& DEG;). Compared with the official CYGNSS product, the retrieval accuracy of optimized soil moisture was improved by 10\%. The method proposed in this paper will play an important reference role in the study of soil moisture retrieval using spaceborne GNSS-R data.

VL  - 9
SN  - 2471-2132
AB  - Previous studies have explored the long time series and large-scale cultivated land nutrient sensitivity and its spatial differentiation characteristics in arid zones from human activities in the context of climate change. This study is based on 10-year interval data on soil nutrient content of cultivated land in the oasis in Xinjiang, China, cultivated land use intensity (LUI) and climate data sets. Using sensitivity and GIS analysis methods, this paper studies soil nutrient sensitivities and their spatial distribution patterns in the context of LUI and climate change. The results showed significant response differences and spatial heterogeneity regarding the sensitivity of soil nutrient systems to LUI and climate change. Among them, soil nutrients were the most sensitive to temperature changes, followed by LUI, while precipitation was the weakest. Soil nutrient sensitivity showed a decreasing spatial distribution pattern from the northeast to the southwest. The soil nutrient system had a strong adaptability to LUI and climate change. However, there were differences in different sensitivity states. These results provide scientific guidance for the spatial selection and implementation of soil fertility enhancement and land remediation projects in similar arid areas.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - The question if biochar is a suitable soil nutrient amendment for potato cultivation in the Atlantic Canada is yet to be answered. The objective of this study was to answer this question. Three replicates of twelve lysimeters, each 8000 cm2, were packed with an Atlantic Canada representative soil to cultivate potatoes with four treatments of soil amendments (T1 = control [no added nutrients], T2 = B [biochar], T3 = F [synthetic fertilizer @ recommended NPK], and T4 = B + F [biochar + recommended NPK]) under a completely randomized block design with factorial arrangements. Chemical analyses of soils were conducted for physical, hydrological, and chemical (including concentration of macro- and micro-nutrients) prior to and after the completion experiments to evaluate soil fertility and its resulting effects on crop yield. The biochar amendment improved soil micro- and macro-nutrients. Soil organic matter, pH, and cation exchange capacity (ECE) significantly increased by application of biochar. The maximum potato yield of 30,467.4 kg hâˆ’1 was achieved by the combined application of biochar and synthetic fertilizer as this combination resulted in the maximum net benefit (4433.98 haâˆ’1) in comparison with control treatment that had net loss of â€“ 2621.49 haâˆ’1. It is therefore concluded that biochar amendment of soils resembling to that of the Atlantic Canada representative soil used in this study, with a mix of recommended NPK for, can formulate a smart precision farming nutrient management technique for this region subject to the field trials and replicate experimental treatments for more than three times.

AB  - Precision agriculture is crucial for ensuring food security in a growing global population. Nutrients, their presence, concentration, and effectiveness, are key components in data-driven agriculture. Assessing macro and micro-nutrients, as well as factors such as water and pH, helps determine soil fertility, which is vital for supporting healthy plant growth and high crop yields. Insufficient soil nutrient assessment during continuous cropping can threaten long-term agricultural viability. Soil nutrients need to be measured and replenished after each harvest for optimal yield. However, existing soil testing procedures are expensive and time-consuming. The proposed research aims to assess soil nutrient levels, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, to provide critical information and guidance on restoring optimal soil fertility. In this research, a novel chip-level colorimeter is fabricated to detect the N and P elements of soil onto a handheld colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Chemical reaction with soil solution generates color in the presence of nutrients, which are then quantitatively measured using sensors. The test samples are collected from various farmlands, and the results are validated with laboratory analysis of samples using spectrophotometers used in laboratories. ANOVA test has been performed in which F value {\textgreater} 1 in our study indicates statistically significant differences between the group means. The alternate hypothesis, which proposes the presence of significant differences between the groups, is supported by the data. The device created in this paper has crucial potential in terms of environmental and biological applications. Â© 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Soil moisture assessment on production land is gaining more attention as one of the critical factors and had a remarkable impact on agriculture production, life as well as global warming. Bibliometric analysis is performed by extracting datasets from SCOPUS from 2000 to 2020 to analyse soil moisture using remote sensing study and progress in the last two decades. The outcome indicates that study on the development of soil moisture monitoring tools using remote sensing has been increasing especially for international cooperation articles. International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) recorded the most productive journal published articles in this field. Among the top active countries that produce most articles were the USA followed by China. The current keywords search on soil mechanism and satellite technology frequently searched in this field. Global issues that focus on the relationship between soil moisture and environmental forecast such as drought, climate change and global warming by using remote sensing technology needed more high impact research outputs in the future.

TI  - Retrieving {Heterogeneous} {Surface} {Soil} {Moisture} at 100 m {Across} the {Globe} via {Fusion} of {Remote} {Sensing} and {Land} {Surface} {Parameters
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Successful monitoring of soil moisture dynamics at high spatio-temporal resolutions globally is hampered by the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties in space and complex interactions between water and the environmental variables that control it. Current soil moisture monitoring schemes via in situ station networks are sparsely distributed while remote sensing satellite soil moisture maps have a very coarse spatial resolution. In this study, an empirical surface soil moisture (SSM) model was established via fusion of in situ continental and regional scale soil moisture networks, remote sensing data (SMAP and Sentinel-1) and high-resolution land surface parameters (e.g., soil texture, terrain) using a quantile random forest (QRF) algorithm. The model had a spatial resolution of 100 m and performed well under cultivated, herbaceous, forest, and shrub soils (overall R2 = 0.524, RMSE = 0.07 m3 mâˆ’3). It has a relatively good transferability at the regional scale among different soil moisture networks (mean RMSE = 0.08â€“0.10 m3 mâˆ’3). The global model was applied to map SSM dynamics at 30â€“100 m across a field-scale soil moisture network (TERENO-WÃ¼stebach) and an 80-ha cultivated cropland in Wisconsin, USA. Without the use of local training data, the model was able to delineate the variations in SSM at the field scale but contained large bias. With the addition of 10\% local training datasets (â€œspikingâ€), the bias of the model was significantly reduced. The QRF model was relatively insensitive to the resolution of Sentinel-1 data but was affected by the resolution and accuracy of soil maps. It was concluded that the empirical model has the potential to be applied elsewhere across the globe to map SSM at the regional to field scales for research and applications. Future research is required to improve the performance of the model by incorporating more field-scale soil moisture sensor networks and assimilation with process-based models.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter for the circulation of water and energy exchange between surface and the atmosphere, playing an important role in hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology. Traditional methods for monitoring soil moisture suffer from spatial discontinuity, time-consuming processes, and high costs. Remote sensing technology enables the non-destructive and efficient retrieval of land information, allowing rapid soil moisture monitoring to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Satellite data with different resolutions provide different observation scales. Evaluating the accuracy of estimating soil moisture based on open and free satellite data, as well as exploring the comprehensiveness and adaptability of different satellites for soil moisture temporal and spatial observations, are important research contents of current soil moisture monitoring. The study utilized three types of satellite data, namely GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4, with respective temporal and spatial resolutions of 16 m (every 4 days), 30 m (every 16 days), and 50 m (daily). The gray relational analysis (GRA) was employed to identify vegetation indices that selected sensitivity to soil moisture at varying depths (3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm). Then, this study employed random forest (RF), Extra Tree (ETr), and linear regression (LR) algorithms to estimate soil moisture at different depths with optical satellite data sources. The results showed that the accuracy of soil moisture estimation was different at different growth stages. The model accuracy exhibited an upward trend during the middle and late growth stages, coinciding with higher vegetation coverage; however, it demonstrated a decline in accuracy during the early and late growth stages due to either the absence or limited presence of vegetation. Among the three satellite images, the vegetation indices derived from GF-1 exhibited were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and demonstrated superior soil moisture estimation accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.129-0.928, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.078), followed by Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging 0.117-0.862, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.088). The soil moisture estimation accuracy of GF-4 was the worst (with R2 ranging 0.070-0.921, RMSE ranging 0.020-0.140). Thus, GF-1 is suitable for vegetated areas. In addition, the ETr model outperformed the other models in both accuracy and stability (ETr model: R2 ranging from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging from 0.021 to 0.091; RF model: R2 ranging from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE ranging from 0.019 to 0.085; LR model: R2 ranging from 0.048 to 0.733, RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). Utilizing GF-1 is recommended to construct the ETr model for assessing soil moisture variations in the farming land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there are limited ground sample data, it is advisable to utilize high-spatiotemporal-resolution remote sensing data, along with machine learning algorithms such as ETr and RF, which are suitable for small samples, for soil moisture estimation.

TI  - Soil moisture and salinity inversion based on new remote sensing index and neural network at a salina-alkaline wetland
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, soil moisture and salinity are important elements to control regional ecology and climate, vegetation growth and land function. Soil moisture and salt content are more important in arid wetlands. The Ebinur Lake wetland is an important part of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, China. The Ebinur Lake Basin is a representative area of the arid climate and ecological degradation in central Asia. It is of great significance to study the spatial distribution of soil moisture and salinity and its causes for land and wetland ecological restoration in the Ebinur Lake Basin. Based on the field measurement and Landsat 8 satellite data, a variety of remote sensing indexes related to soil moisture and salinity were tested and compared, and the prediction models of soil moisture and salinity were established, and the accuracy of the models was assessed. Among them, the salinity indexes D1 and D2 were the latest ones that we proposed according to the research area and data. The distribution maps of soil moisture and salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin were retrieved from remote sensing data, and the correlation analysis between soil moisture and salinity was performed. Among several soil moisture and salinity prediction indexes, the normalized moisture index NDWI had the highest correlation with soil moisture, and the salinity index D2 had the highest correlation with soil salinity, reaching 0.600 and 0.637, respectively. The accuracy of the BP neural network model for estimating soil salinity was higher than the one of other models; R2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.083 S/m. The effect of the cubic function prediction model for estimating soil moisture was also higher than that of the BP neural network, support vector machine and other models; R2 = 0.538, RMSE = 0.230. The regularity of soil moisture and salinity changes seemed to be consistent, the correlation degree was 0.817, and the synchronous change degree was higher. The soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin was generally low in the surrounding area, high in the middle area, high in the lake area and low in the vegetation coverage area. The soil moisture in the Ebinur Lake Basin slightly decreased outward with the Ebinur Lake as the center and was higher in the west and lower in the east. However, the spatial distribution of soil moisture had a higher mutation rate and stronger heterogeneity than that of soil salinity. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Evaluating the {Hydrus}-{1D} {Model} {Optimized} by {Remote} {Sensing} {Data} for {Soil} {Moisture} {Simulations} in the {Maize} {Root} {Zone
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - The Hydrus-1D model is widely used for soil water content (SWC) simulations, wherein the exact configuration of soil hydraulic parameters is key to accuracy. To assess the feasibility of using â€œlow-costâ€ multi-source remote sensing data to optimize the parameters of the Hydrus-1D model, five types of soil hydrodynamic parameter acquisition methods were designed for comparative evaluation, including the use of default parameters for soil texture types (DSHP), predictions from three and five soil mechanical composition parameters (NNP3/NNP5), inverse solutions from measured historical data (ISHD), and innovative introduction of historical remote sensing data (ERA-5 land reanalysis information and MODIS LAI products) instead of ground measured data for the inverse solution (ISRS). Two spring maize crops were planted in Beijing, China, in 2021 and 2022. Meteorological, soil, and crop data were collected as real measurements of the true values during the growth period. The boundary flux characteristics of the model simulation results were analyzed. The accuracy differences in the five approaches were compared from three perspectives: overall root zone, growth stage, and soil depth. The results showed that (1) evapotranspiration was the main pathway for soil water depletion in the root zone of maize; the actual total evapotranspiration accounted for 68.26 and 69.43\% of the total precipitation in 2012 and 2022, respectively. (2) The accuracy of the SWC simulations in the root zone was acceptable for different approaches in the following order: NNP5 (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 5.47\%) {\textgreater} ISRS (RMSE = 5.48\%) {\textgreater} NNP3 (RMSE = 5.66\%) {\textgreater} ISHD (RMSE = 5.68\%) {\textgreater} DSHP (RMSE = 6.57\%). The ISRS approach based on remote sensing data almost achieved the best performance while effectively reducing the workload and cost. (3) The accuracy of the SWC simulation at different growth stages was ranked as follows: seedling stage (mean absolute error (MAE) = 3.29\%) {\textgreater} tassel stage (MAE = 4.68\%) {\textgreater} anthesis maturity stage (MAE = 5.52\%). (4) All approaches' simulation errors exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The ISHD approach, based on the measured data, achieved the best performance at a depth of 60 cm (MAE = 2.8\%). The Hydrus-1D model optimized using multi-source remote sensing data can effectively simulate SWC in the maize root zone with low working cost, which is significant for applications in areas where it is difficult to obtain field soil hydrodynamic property parameters to simulate SWC at a global scale.

TI  - Comparison of bagging, boosting and stacking algorithms for surface soil moisture mapping using optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing synergies
VL  - 217
SN  - 0341-8162
AB  - Soil moisture information is key to irrigation water management, drought monitoring, and yield prediction. It plays a vital role in the water cycle and energy budget between the earth's surface and atmosphere. Hence, its monitoring is crucial for both natural and anthropogenic environments. While the current remote sensing-based global SM products available at coarser resolution (3/15 km) are unsuitable for field-level operations, the most widely used microwave remote sensing suffers from model complexities and in-situ data requirements. Weather conditions limit the alternate approaches such as optical/thermal. This study aims to map surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m spatial resolution in a semi-arid region by fusing optical, thermal, and microwave remote sensing data using bagging, boosting, and stacking machine learning approaches. The reference data were collected using a soil moisture meter. The covariates included radar backscatter from Sentinel-1, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, land surface temperature, and spectral indices derived from Landsat 8. Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection which identified radar backscatter, modified normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature as the most critical covariates impacting the SSM. The random forest (RF) showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71), and least root mean square error (RMSE = 5.17\%). The cubist model had the least mean bias error (MBE = 0.21\%) during independent validation. Stacking of cubist, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and RF using elastic net (ELNET) as meta-learner further reduced the MBE (0.18\%) and RMSE (5.03\%) during the validation. Overall, stacking multiple machine learning models improved model prediction and can be recommended to improve the digital soil moisture mapping.

TI  - Soil organic matter mapping using {INLA}-{SPDE} with remote sensing based soil moisture indices and {Fourier} transforms decomposed variables
VL  - 437
SN  - NA
AB  - Generating accurate spatial information on soil organic matter (SOM) is increasingly important in the context of global environmental change. Both prediction models and environmental covariates influence the mapping results and accuracy, making them important factors in SOM mapping. The Bayesian spatial model INLA-SPDE is an emerging model, that has shown potential in digital soil mapping (DSM), but its application is still limited. Soil moisture, which affects soil water status and the decomposition of SOM, can be a potential predictor for mapping SOM. However, the difficulty of obtaining soil moisture measurements over a large area using ground-based methods hinders its application. Recently, high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) has provided a possible way to generate soil moisture indices over a large area. However, the effectiveness of RS-based soil moisture indices on SOM mapping is unknown. Fourier transforms decomposed (FTD) variables based on vegetation indices have been proven effective in detecting time-series patterns of crop growth, thereby improving the mapping accuracy of farmland. Yet, the effectiveness of FTD variables has not been verified in other vegetation-covered areas. This paper examines the use of INLA-SPDE with three RS-based soil moisture indices (NSDSIs) and six FTD variables for SOM mapping compared to Random Forest (RF), in a study area with diverse vegetation cover in Anhui Province, China. The finding indicates that with the optimal combination of environmental covariates, INLA-SPDE yields a higher prediction accuracy than RF, with an increase of 18\% in R2. Either the RS-based soil moisture indices covariates or the FTD variables are effective in mapping SOM. When compared to using only natural environmental covariates, the best combination including RS-based soil moisture indices and FTD variables improved the mapping accuracy by 25\% in terms of R2, 21\% of LCCC, and 11\% of RMSE. Furthermore, quantitative prediction uncertainty maps are derived based on the INLA-SPDE. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of INLA-SPDE model with the RS-based soil moisture indices and Fourier transforms decomposed variables for SOM mapping. Â© 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Impact of changes in the relationship between salinity and soil moisture on remote sensing data usage in northeast {Thailand
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Although rice is a major agricultural product in northeast Thailand, its productivity is low and unstable because rice is cultivated under rainfed conditions and there are issues with soil salinization. In this region, some of the paddy fields have been abandoned because of severe soil salinization. Therefore, effective agricultural management strategies are needed to manage soil salinization for achieving stable agricultural production. To realize effective management strategies, it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salinization. To evaluate and update the spatiotemporal soil salinization using remote sensing data, we first evaluate the relationship between soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and soil moisture content (SMC) during dry seasons. Subsequently, the effect of changes in this relationship on the normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) derived from remote sensing data for estimating soil ECe is evaluated. The relationship between ECe and NDSI, depending on the soil moisture conditions in the study area, is clarified. The findings of this study indicate that for estimating ECe using the NDSI, it is necessary to consider not only soil moisture conditions but also its quality at the time of satellite observation.

TI  - One-year monitoring of daily earthworm cast production: {Surface} cast contribution to soil fertility in a subtropical forest
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The process of earthworm casting plays an important role in soil fertility. The contributions of earthworm casts to soil nutrients dynamics cannot be fully understood unless the temporal changes in earthworm cast production and the related nutrient resource pools are explored in the field. Here, we recorded the daily surface cast production of earthworms and monthly change patterns of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in casts in a subtropical plantation for one year and compared the nutrient concentrations and microbial community traits (structure and bacterial activity) in casts with those in bulk soils. Our objectives were to characterize the temporal patterns of earthworm cast production and the C and nutrients in casts and to assess the potential contribution of earthworm casts to soil fertility. The results showed that the annual surface cast production at the study site was 8.3 tons haâˆ’1; monthly cast production was {\textgreater}80 g mâˆ’2 during April to November and {\textless}30 g mâˆ’2 during December to March. The annual outputs of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP) in surface casts were 68.10, 4.84 and 0.38 g mâˆ’2, respectively; the annual outputs of available P (AP), NH4+-N and NO3âˆ’-N were 22.4, 147.0 and 61.3 mg mâˆ’2, respectively. The concentrations of TOC and TN in casts were higher during warm months, but NH4+-N was higher during cold months, while both the concentrations of TP and AP in casts were constant throughout the year. The nutrient concentrations were 1.6â€“4.3-fold greater, and the microbial biomass C and N contents were 7â€“8-fold greater in earthworm casts than those in bulk soils. However, the bacterial stress index (BSI) was significantly greater in casts than in the bulk soil, which implies that bacteria in casts were under stress. Accordingly, the ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass (F/B) was significantly higher in casts than in the bulk soil. Earthworm casting activity can process forest soil into a â€œnew soilâ€, which forms large amounts of earthworm-induced hotspots of soil fertility. These resource pools in casts, with monthly fluctuated C and N and constant P, could be more readily accessed by fungi rather than bacteria. Earthworm casting activity potentially changes both the nutrients available and the interactions of plants and rhizosphere microbiota. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 39
SN  - NA
AB  - The usage of spatial tools might be helpful in the optimization of decision-making regarding soil management, with technologies that assist in the interpretation of information related to soil fertility. Therefore, the present study evaluated the spatial variability of chemical attributes of the soil under an agroforestry system compared to a native forest in the municipality of TomÃ©-aÃ§u, Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Soil samples were performed at 36 points arranged in a 55 x 55 m grid. The soils were prepared and submitted to analysis in order to determine pH in H2O, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium and aluminium, available phosphorus, potential acidity, organic matter, bases saturation and aluminium saturation. For each soil attribute, the spherical, gaussian and exponential models were adjusted. After the semivariograms fitting, data interpolation for assessment of spatial variability of the variables was performed through ordinary kriging. The spherical and gaussian models were the most efficient models in estimation of soil attributes spatial variability, in most cases. Most of variables presented a regular spatial variability in their respective kriging maps, with some exceptions. In general, the kriging maps can be used, and we can take them as logistical maps for management and intervention practices in order to improve the soil fertility in the study areas. The results principal components indicate the need for integrated management of soil chemical attributes, with localized application of acidity correctors, fertilizers and other types of incomes, using the spatial variability of these fertility variables.

TI  - 15N} fate in maize cropping system in response to black soil fertility improvement in {China
VL  - 113
SN  - NA
AB  - Applications of high amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer are essential for obtaining sustainable maize (Zea mays L.) yields but also result in low N-use efficiency (NUE) and cause a series of environmental problems. To optimize fertilizer management, it is necessary to determine the effects of soil fertility improvement on NUE and the fate of N fertilizer. In this study, we conducted a 15N tracer pot experiment involving five different fertilizer treatments in soils with five different total organic carbon levels under field conditions. The average NUE ranged from 36 to 56\% 15N-urea and 0.1 to 0.2\% residual N in the first and second seasons. The N retained in the soil ranged from 10 to 28\%, and the N lost to water and the atmosphere ranged from 29 to 39\% in the five soils. Compared with that in the low-fertility soils, NUE in the high-fertility soils was 20â€“45\% greater, and N loss was 1 â€“6\% lower. The results showed that higher soil fertility corresponded to higher NUE and lower N loss. We suggest that although the local customary N fertilizer application rate (N3; 165 kg N/ha) in the study area is reasonable for low-fertility soils, after soil fertility improvements, an approximately 50\% reduction of N fertilizer should be implemented.

TI  - Impact of elevated phosphogypsum on soil fertility and its aerobic biotransformation through indigenous microorganisms ({IMO}'s) based technology
VL  - 297
SN  - NA
AB  - Phosphogypsum (PG) is a waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer industry, produced in huge amount during the manufacture of phosphoric acid by economic wet process. Assessment of PG toxicity on soil has been poorly emphasized, therefore an efficient methods needs to be adopted to assess its toxic effect on soil fertility. We also need an effective eco-technological strategies for better waste PG management in order to improve the environmental health. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of PG toxicity on fertile soil and utilization of indigenous microorganisms for aerobic detoxification of PG contaminated soil to evaluate the scope for biostimulation based in situ bioremediation. In this study it is evident that application of PG to fertile soil in certain concentration results highly acidic, sulfate rich, aerobic environment, thus severely weakens the metabolic activity of the indigenous microorganisms. This investigation via microcosm based study further evaluated the intrinsic biotransformation ability of these microorganisms and found that was enhanced significantly ({\textgreater}95\% reduction in sulfate concentration in 180 days) with carbon, nitrogen and phosphate amendments. Community level physiological profiling analyses indicated distinct shift in metabolic abilities following carbon amendments. Our study for the first time may help to formulate a strategy in aerobic biotransformation of PG contaminated soil environment, yet appreciable rate by supplying adequate nutrients. Â© 2021

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - One of the best preconditions for the sufficient monitoring of peat bog ecosystems is the collection, processing, and analysis of unique spatial data to understand peat bog dynamics. Over two seasons, we sampled groundwater level (GWL) and soil moisture (SM) ground truth data at two diverse locations at the Rokytka Peat bog within the Sumava Mountains, Czechia. These data served as reference data and were modeled with a suite of potential variables derived from digital surface models (DSMs) and RGB, multispectral, and thermal orthoimages reflecting topomorphometry, vegetation, and surface temperature information generated from drone mapping. We used 34 predictors to feed the random forest (RF) algorithm. The predictor selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance assessment were performed with the target-oriented leave-location-out (LLO) spatial cross-validation (CV) strategy combined with forward feature selection (FFS) to avoid overfitting and to predict on unknown locations. The spatial CV performance statistics showed low (R-2 = 0.12) to high (R-2 = 0.78) model predictions. The predictor importance was used for model interpretation, where temperature had strong impact on GWL and SM, and we found significant contributions of other predictors, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Enhanced Red-Green-Blue Vegetation Index (ERGBVE), Shape Index (SHP), Green Leaf Index (GLI), Brightness Index (BI), Coloration Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), Primary Colours Hue Index (HI), Overall Hue Index (HUE), SAGA Wetness Index (TWI), Plan Curvature (PlnCurv), Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM). Additionally, we estimated the area of applicability (AOA) by presenting maps where the prediction model yielded high-quality results and where predictions were highly uncertain because machine learning (ML) models make predictions far beyond sampling locations without sampling data with no knowledge about these environments. The AOA method is well suited and unique for planning and decision-making about the best sampling strategy, most notably with limited data.

AB  - Investigating the growth behavior of plant root systems as a function of soil water is considered an important information for the study of root physiology. A nonâ€invasive tool based on electromagnetic wave transmittance in the microwave frequency range, operating close to 4.8 GHz, was developed using microstrip patch antennas to determine the volumetric moisture of soil in rhizoboxes. Antennas were placed on both sides of the rhizobox and, using a vector network analyzer, measured the S parameters. The dispersion parameter S21 (dB) was also used to show the effect of different soil types and temperature on the measurement. In addition, system sensitivity, reproducibility and repeatability were evaluated. The quantitative results of the soil moisture, measured in rhizoboxes, presented in this paper, demonstrate that the microwave technique using microstrip patch antennas is a reliable, nonâ€invasive and accurate system, and has shown potentially promising applications for measurement of rhizoboxâ€based root phenotyping.

TI  - Evaluation of microwave soil moisture data for monitoring live fuel moisture content ({LFMC}) over the coterminous {United} {States
VL  - 771
SN  - NA
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC), which is the ratio of water in the fresh biomass to the dry biomass, is a key variable that affects wildfire behaviour. Previous studies have assessed soil moisture as a predictor of LFMC over small areas with limited data, but a comprehensive evaluation at sub-continental scale is still lacking, and the explanatory utility has not been evaluated under different aridity conditions. In this study, the utility was evaluated using microwave soil moisture data from the ESA ECV\_SM product from 1979 to 2018 and LFMC data from over 1000 sites in the coterminous United States. A time-lagged robust linear regression model was adopted, and the results were compared with analysis from in situ soil moisture measurements at adjacent sites. The results suggested that at most sites the LFMC correlates best with soil moisture within 60 days prior to LFMC sampling, and that the correlation is lower in areas with complex terrain. LFMC can be estimated from soil moisture with a mean RMSE of around 20\%. The correlation between LFMC and soil moisture is significant (p{\textless}0.01) in most regions, and is mostly stable in different years. The major fuel types with a high response to soil moisture include pine, redcedar, sagebrush, oak, manzanita, chamise, mesquite and juniper, depending on the region. The LFMC soil moisture correlation varies with the aridity condition, and soil moisture has a higher explanatory utility on LFMC under dry conditions. An analysis using SMAP Level-4 product indicated that the surface and root-zone soil moisture perform similarly in LFMC estimation. This study suggests that microwave soil moisture data contain sufficient information on LFMC, and may serve as a reference for the development of more sophisticated LFMC estimation methods.

VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Deteriorating soil fertility, low unreliable rainfall and soil moisture stress has resulted to low crop yields among farmers of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), necessitating a search for more sustainable production practices. Zai technology has the ability to promote soil moisture retention and enhances soil fertility. A four-seasons field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of Zai technology combined with cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer on selected soil properties and sorghum yields in Kabati, Kitui County. The experiment was set up in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with eight treatments replicated thrice with sorghum Gadam as the test crop. Soil sampling was done at the beginning of the first season and at the end of the fourth season at a dept of 0â€“15 cm across each plot for laboratory analyses. From the results, the increase in electrical conductivity was significant at p {\textless} 0.05 in all the treatments after four cropping seasons. Total organic carbon significantly increased in Zai with cattle manure (p = 0.045), conventional with no input (p = 0.038) and conventional with cattle manure (p = 0.045). Available phosphorous significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) increased in treatments under Zai technology while total nitrogen significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced after the four cropping seasons. There was a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) interactive effect of the tested factors on soil pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and available phosphorous at the end of the experiment. Moreover, there was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) interactive effects on grain yields (SR18 and SR19 seasons) and stover yields (SR18, LR19, and SR19 seasons), with higher yields being recorded in treatments under Zai technology. This study demonstrates the importance of Zai technology in increasing crop yield by trapping water and enhancing its retention and infiltration into the soil for uptake by plants. This study concluded that positive impacts on important soil properties and crop yield could be realized when Zai technology is utilized alongside either sole inorganics or a combination of organic and inorganic amendments and this could be used as a strategy to improve crop production in eastern Kenya and other similar areas.

TI  - Riceâ€“fish coculture system enhances paddy soil fertility, bacterial network stability and keystone taxa diversity
VL  - 348
SN  - NA
AB  - High-input, modern rice farming (MRF) has caused severe soil degradation worldwide, necessitating a transition towards more sustainable practices. The traditional riceâ€“fish coculture (RFC) and manure fertilization (Manure) may provide valuable insights to this transition. However, it remains elusive how long-term agricultural conversion influences microbial community structure, soil fertility, and food supply. Here, we performed six-year conversions of MRF to either RFC or Manure in a hilly area of Sichuan (China). We found that agricultural conversions exerted a greater impact than rice growing stages on bacterial community structure. The RFC bacterial network exhibited the highest modularity and robustness, but also harbored the most diverse keystone taxa, followed by Manure. In contrast, MRF displayed network properties that are characteristic of unstable communities. Importantly, RFC also exhibited the greatest capability in improving the preservation of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and has significantly increased soil pH ({\textgreater} 1.5 units). Yet, adopting traditional practices, particularly Manure, decreased rice yields, but fish harvested in RFC could offset the decrease in rice yield. Our field study highlights bacterial network structure and keystone taxa diversity as possible indicators for agriculture sustainability, but also incentivizes the integration of traditional RFC in developing novel sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Monitoring soil water content for decision supporting in agricultural water management based on critical threshold values adopted for {Andosol} in the temperate monsoon climate
VL  - 229
SN  - NA
AB  - Maintaining soil water content within the readily available range is optimum concerning crop production and water use. In this regard, the continuous monitoring of soil water content is a crucial element for identifying the key parameters for sustainable agricultural water management. In this study, volumetric soil water content (Î¸v) was monitored and analyzed in a bare soil agricultural field (Sakaecho experimental field of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology). The field consisting of volcanic ash soils was monitored from June 2016 to September 2017 using capacitance sensor (CS). The optimal range of readily available water for plant uptake was defined as the range between field capacity and depletion level (Î¸Dep). These values were determined from the soil water potentials and Î¸v values measured using pressure plate and soil cores, respectively. The 16-month period monitoring result revealed substantial temporal variability in Î¸v in response to rainfall, evaporation and deep percolation. The monitored values of Î¸v were above the Î¸Dep (0.307 cm3 cmâˆ’3 measured at suction (pF) value of 3.0) throughout the monitoring period for the 10â€“20 and 20â€“30 cm soil layers. In contrast, for the surface soil (0â€“10 cm), the Î¸v fell below Î¸Dep for 27\% of the monitoring period despite the high rainfall during those periods owing to high evaporation and deep percolation. The below Î¸Dep results for the surface soil suggests the need to conduct continuous Î¸v monitoring, to support decision for planning efficient irrigation water management to avoid yield loss of shallow-rooted crops and deep-rooted crops at their earliest growth stages as well as quality reductions due to moisture stresses.

TI  - A {Novel} {Method} for {Long} {Time} {Series} {Passive} {Microwave} {Soil} {Moisture} {Downscaling} over {Central} {Tibet} {Plateau
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - The coarse scale of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) is not suitable for regional agricultural and hydrological applications such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. The optical/thermal infrared (OTI) data-based passive microwave SSM downscaling method can effectively improve its spatial resolution to fine scale for regional applications. However, the estimation capability of SSM with long time series is limited by OTI data, which are heavily polluted by clouds. To reduce the dependence of the method on OTI data, an SSM retrieval and spatio-temporal fusion model (SMRFM) is proposed in the study. Specifically, a model coupling in situ data, MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) OTI data, and topographic information is developed to retrieve MODIS SSM (1 km) using the least squares method. Then the retrieved MODIS SSM and the spatio-temporal fusion model are employed to downscale the passive microwave SSM from coarse scale to 1 km. The proposed SMRFM is implemented in a grassland dominated area over Naqu, central Tibet Plateau, for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System sensor (AMSR-E) SSM downscaling in unfrozen period. The in situ SSM and Noah land surface model 0.01 degrees SSM are used to validate the estimated MODIS SSM with long time series. The evaluations show that the estimated MODIS SSM has the same temporal resolution with AMSR-E and obtains significantly improved detailed spatial information. Moreover, the temporal accuracy of estimated MODIS SSM against in situ data (r = 0.673, mu bRMSE = 0.070 m(3)/m(3)) is better than the AMSR-E (r = 0.661, mu bRMSE = 0.111 m(3)/m(3)). In addition, the temporal r of estimated MODIS SSM is obviously higher than that of Noah data. Therefore, this suggests that the SMRFM can be used to estimate MODIS SSM with long time series by AMSR-E SSM downscaling in the study. Overall, the study can provide help for the development and application of microwave SSM-related scientific research at the regional scale.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility affects crop yield and quality. A quick, accurate evaluation of soil fertility is crucial for agricultural production. Few satellite image-based evaluation studies have quantified soil fertility during the crop growth period. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to the quantitative evaluation of soil fertility. Firstly, the optimal crop spectral variables were selected using the integration of an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with variance inflation factor (VIF). Then, based on the optimal crop spectral variables where the red-edge indices were introduced for the first time, the estimation models were developed using the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to assess soil fertility. The model was finally adopted to map the soil fertility using Sentinel-2 imagery. This study was performed in the Conghua District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The results of our research are as follows: (1) five crop spectral variables (inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), red-edge position (REP), and triangular greenness index (TGI)) were the optimal variables. (2) The BPNN model established with optimal variables provided reliable estimates of soil fertility, with the determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. A nonlinear relation was found between soil fertility and the optimal crop spectral variables. (3) The BPNN model provides the potential for soil fertility mapping using Sentinel-2 images, with an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 0.09 for the measured and estimated results. This study suggests that the proposed method is suitable for the estimation of soil fertility in paddy fields.

TI  - Method development for estimating soil organic carbon content in an alpine region using soil moisture data
VL  - 63
SN  - 1674-7313
AB  - The high soil organic carbon (SOC) content in alpine meadow can significantly change soil hydrothermal properties and further affect the soil temperature and moisture as well as the surface water and energy budget. Therefore, this study first introduces a parameterization scheme to describe the effect of SOC content on soil hydraulic and thermal parameters in a land surface model (LSM), and then the SOC content is estimated by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated surface-layer soil moisture. The accuracy of the estimated SOC content was evaluated using in situ observation data at a soil moisture and temperature-measuring network in Naqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Sensitivity experiments show that the optimum time window for stabilizing the estimation results cannot be shorter than three years. In the experimental area, the estimated SOC content can generally reflect the spatial distribution of the measurements, with a root mean square error of 0.099 m(3) m(-3), a mean bias of 0.043 m(3) m(-3), and a correlation coefficient of 0.695. The estimated SOC content is not sensitive to the temporal frequency of the soil moisture data input. Even if the temporal frequency is as low as that of current soil moisture products derived from passive microwave satellites, the estimation result is still stable. Therefore, by combining a high-quality satellite soil moisture product and a parameter optimization method, it is possible to obtain grid-scale effective parameter values, such as SOC content, for an LSM and improve the simulation ability of the LSM.

VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-reflectometry is a type of remote sensing technology and can be applied to soil moisture retrieval. Until now, various GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval methods have been reported. However, there still exist some problems due to the complexity of modeling and retrieval process, as well as the extreme uncertainty of the experimental environment and equipment. To investigate the behavior of bistatic GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval process, two ground-truth measurements with different soil conditions were carried out and the performance of the input variables was analyzed from the mathematical statistical aspect. Moreover, the feature of XGBoost method was utilized as well. As a recently developed ensemble machine learning method, the XGBoost method just emerged for the classification of remote sensing and geographic data, to investigate the characterization of the input variables in the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It showed a good correlation with the statistical analysis of ground-truth measurements. The variable contributions for the input data can also be seen and evaluated. The study of the paper provides some experimental insights into the behavior of the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It is worthwhile before establishing models and can also help with understanding the underlying GNSS-R phenomena and interpreting data.

TI  - A {Bayesian} machine learning method to explain the error characteristics of global-scale soil moisture products
VL  - 296
SN  - NA
AB  - Estimating accurate surface soil moisture (SM) dynamics from space, and knowing the error characteristics of these estimates, is of great importance for the application of satellite-based SM data throughout many Earth Science/Environmental Engineering disciplines. Here, we introduce the Bayesian inference approach to analyze the error characteristics of widely used passive and active microwave satellite-derived SM data sets, at different overpass times, acquired from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) missions. In particular, we apply Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) and triple collocation analysis (TCA) to investigate the relative importance of different environmental factors and human activities on the accuracy of satellite-based data. To start, we compare the BHM-based sensitivity analysis method to the classic multiple regression models using a frequentist approach, which includes complete pooling and no-pooling models that have been widely used for sensitivity analysis in the field of remote sensing and demonstrate the BHM's adaptability and great potential for providing insight into sensitivity analysis that can be used by various remote sensing research communities. Next, we conduct an uncertainty analysis on BHM's model parameters using a full range of uncertainties to assess the association of various environmental factors with the accuracy of satellite-derived SM data. We focus on investigating human-induced error sources such as disturbed surface soil layers caused by irrigation activities on microwave satellite systems, naturally introduced error sources such as vegetation and soil organic matter, and errors related to the disregard of SM retrieval algorithmic assumptions - such as the thermal equilibrium passive microwave systems. Based on the BHM-based sensitivity analysis, we find that assessments of SM data quality with a single variable should be avoided, since numerous other factors simultaneously influence their quality. As such, this provides a useful framework for applying Bayesian theory to the investigation of the error characteristics of satellite-based SM data and other time-varying geophysical variables.

TI  - Cropping system and rotational grazing effects on soil fertility and enzymatic activity in an integrated organic crop-livestock system
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Alternative grazing systems that incorporate cover crops may be useful to achieve a longer grazing season and maximize forage production. However, little is known about their impact on soil properties, especially in the presence or absence of cattle grazing in the early spring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interacting effects of cropping systems with and without cattle grazing in rotation with corn or soybean on the balance and dynamics of soil fertility and enzyme activity. This study was conducted as a system experiment between 2015 and 2019 in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, USA. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments included presence or absence of cattle grazing and two types of cropping systems (pasture-rye-soybean-pasture [P-R-SB-P] and pasture-wheat/vetch-corn-pasture [P-W/V-C-P]. Soil samples were collected six times during the study. Soil properties analyzed were soil pH, organic matter, salinity, K, Ca, Mg, cation exchange capacity (CEC), P, Î²-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, aryl-sulfatase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, ammonium, nitrate, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), N\%, C\%, S\%, and C:N ratio. Grazing increased glucosidase activity, available Ca, Mg, NO3 -, NH4 +, soil pH, soil C\%, S\%, and the C:N ratio. In the P-W/V-C-P cropping system, soil pH, available Ca, NO3 -, and sulfatase activity were found to increase compared with the P-R-SB-P cropping system. In contrast, soil OM, available K, Mg, CEC, glucosidase, phosphatase, POXC, and total C\%, N\%, and S\% were greater in the P-R-SB-P cropping system compared with the P-W/V-C-P cropping system. The results of this study suggested that rotational grazing can increase soil quality and microbial decomposition under the P-W/V-C-P cropping system, and that this result was greater than under the P-R-SB-P cropping system, leading to a faster nutrient cycling. These results show promise for producers who are seeking methods to diversify their farming operation and reduce the need for external inputs. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Nitrogen leaching and soil nutrient supply vary spatially within a temperate tree-based intercropping system
VL  - 128
SN  - NA
AB  - Well-designed temperate tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems can enhance soil nutrient cycling compared to conventional agricultural systems. To improve the TBI designs and their subsequent wide-scale adoption, greater understanding is required regarding the extent to which widely-spaced tree rows and tree management practices influence spatioâ€“temporal dynamics of soil nutrients. Our 2-year study (2021 and 2022) assessed N-leaching and soil nutrient supply at increasing distances from tree rows (0, 4, 12, 20 m); the 10-year-old TBI system (50 trees haâˆ’1) together with agricultural controls was established in southern QuÃ©bec (Canada). The TBI included hybrid poplars (Populus deltoides Ã— P. nigra) planted alternately with high-value hardwoods in the rows. In each experimental block (n = 3), the TBI system and control were divided into two treatments: without root-pruning versus with (0.75 m depth using a sub-soiler). In 2022, NO3âˆ’ supply rates near tree rows (0 and 4 m; 0.28 Â± 0.04 [mean Â± SE] and 0.37 Â± 0.05 Âµg cmâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, respectively) were lower than alley centres (12 and 20 m) and controls (0.62 Â± 0.07, 0.52 Â± 0.07 and 0.82 Â± 0.07 Âµg cmâˆ’2 dâˆ’1, respectively). A first structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that NO3âˆ’ supply rates were mostly modulated by indirect effects of tree row distance and soil clay content through volumetric water content (VWC). Nitrate leaching (400-mm depth) at 0 and 4 m from the tree row was respectively 8.8 Ã— and 7.5 Ã— lower than that in the control. A second SEM analysis showed direct and indirect (through soil VWC affecting NO3âˆ’ supply rates) effects of distance from tree rows on NO3âˆ’ leaching rates. Within TBI, greater tree leaf litter dry-mass was trapped at 0 and 4 m versus 12 and 20 m. Phosphorus and K availability under tree rows was higher than all other distances within cultivated alleys and control plots. Phosphorus, K, Ca and Mg supplies within cultivated alleys were generally similar among distances (4, 12, and 20 m) and did not differ from controls. An unexpected lack of effect of tree root pruning was observed regarding soil nutrient supply and N leaching. Clay content was a major driver of soil nutrient supply and N leaching. The role of TBI systems in determining soil nutrient dynamics depended upon the soil nutrient and sampling period that was measured, with greater effects beneath the trees and at the tree-crop interface.

TI  - A novel portable microchip electrophoresis system for rapid on-site detection of soil nutrient ions
VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - The conventional techniques for soil nutrient ion detection face challenges, including prolonged preparation periods and the necessity for distinct instruments tailored to each specific ion. To address these issues, we have engineered a cutting-edge soil nutrient ion detection apparatus: the Microchip Electrophoresis Soil Nutrient Ion Portable Detection System (ME-SNI-PDS). This system, leveraging microchip electrophoresis with a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (ME-C4D), simplifies the detection process with user-friendly touchscreen controls. Our system is capable of simultaneous detection of key soil nutrient ionsâ€”ammonium (NH4+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), nitrate (NO3âˆ’), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4âˆ’)â€”in a swift 180 s, facilitated by precise voltage regulation. We have refined the buffer solution, consisting of 20 mM 2-(N-morpholinyl)-ethanesulfonic acid and L-histidine, with the addition of 0.01 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 10 mM 18-crown-6, to ensure the complete resolution of soil nutrient ions. Following this, we established highly accurate peak height-to-concentration correlations for the six aforementioned ions, each with a coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.99. The detection limits for these ions stand at a remarkably low concentration of 0.05 mM, translating to 0.9 mg lâˆ’1 for NH4+, 2.0 mg lâˆ’1 for Ca2+, 1.2 mg lâˆ’1 for Mg2+, 1.96 mg lâˆ’1 for K+, 3.1 mg lâˆ’1 for NO3âˆ’, and 4.85 mg lâˆ’1 for H2PO4âˆ’. Subsequent soil leachate analysis via the ME-SNI-PDS has yielded ion content data that, upon comparison with results from continuous flow analyser (CFA) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, confirm the systemâ€™s exceptional integration, compactness, portability, speed, and efficiency. The ME-SNI-PDS shows immense promise for application in precision agriculture and the prevention of surface soil pollution. It is poised to make a significant impact in the realm of crop fertilization and environmental stewardship. Â© 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Spring soil moisture (SM) is of great importance for monitoring agricultural drought and waterlogging in farmland areas. While winter snow cover has an important impact on spring SM, relatively little research has examined the correlation between winter snow cover and spring SM in great detail. To understand the effects of snow cover on SM over farmland, the relationship between winter snow cover parameters (maximum snow depth (MSD) and average snow depth (ASD)) and spring SM in Northeast China was examined based on 30 year passive microwave snow depth (SD) and SM remote-sensing products. Linear regression models based on winter snow cover were established to predict spring SM. Moreover, 4 year SD and SM data were applied to validate the performance of the linear regression models. Additionally, the effects of meteorological factors on spring SM also were analyzed using multiparameter linear regression models. Finally, as a specific application, the best-performing model was used to predict the probability of spring drought and waterlogging in farmland in Northeast China. Our results illustrated the positive effects of winter snow cover on spring SM. The average correlation coefficient (R) of winter snow cover and spring SM was above 0.5 (significant at a 95\% confidence level) over farmland. The performance of the relationship between snow cover and SM in April was better than that in May. Compared to the multiparameter linear regression models in terms of fitting coefficient, MSD can be used as an important snow parameter to predict spring drought and waterlogging probability in April. Specifically, if the relative SM threshold is 50\% when spring drought occurs in April, the prediction probability of the linear regression model concerning snow cover and spring SM can reach 74\%. This study improved our understanding of the effects of winter snow cover on spring SM and will be beneficial for further studies on the prediction of spring drought.

AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) monitoring is crucial for various applications in agriculture, hydrology, and climate science. Remote Sensing (RS) offers a powerful tool for large-scale SM retrieval. This paper explores the advancements in RS techniques for SM estimation. We discuss the applications of these techniques, along with the advantages and limitations of traditional physical models and data-driven Machine Learning (ML) based approaches. The paper emphasizes the potential of combining ML and physical models to leverage the strengths of both approaches. We explore the challenges associated with this integration and future research directions to improve the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of RS-based SM retrieval. Finally, the paper also discusses a few issues such as input data selection, data availability, ML complexity, the need for public datasets for benchmarking, and analysis. Â© The Author(s) 2024.

VL  - 22
SN  - 1525-755X
AB  - Data assimilation provides a practical way to improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulation by integrating a land surface model and satellite data. This study establishes a multisource remote sensing data assimilation framework by incorporating a simultaneous state and parameter estimation method to acquire an accurate estimation of the soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau. The brightness temperature of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is directly assimilated into the coupled system of the Common Land Model (CoLM) and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) to improve the soilmoisture simulation. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature product and the Beijing Normal University (BNU) leaf area index product are employed to not only improve the estimation of temperature and vegetation variables from the CoLM, but they also provide more accurate background information for the RTM during the brightness temperature assimilation. In situ measurements from the Naqu network are used to evaluate the results. The model simulation showed an obvious underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of soil temperature, which was alleviated by the assimilation experiments, particularly in the shallow soil layers. The estimated parameters also showed advantages in the soilmoisture simulation when compared with the default parameters. The assimilation experiment presents promising results in the combination of model and multisource remote sensing data for estimating soil moisture over the complex mountainous region in Tibet.

TI  - A {Performance} {Analysis} of {Soil} {Dielectric} {Models} over {Organic} {Soils} in {Alaska} for {Passive} {Microwave} {Remote} {Sensing} of {Soil} {Moisture
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture (SM) requires a physically based dielectric model that quantitatively converts the volumetric SM into the soil bulk dielectric constant. Mironov 2009 is the dielectric model used in the operational SM retrieval algorithms of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions. However, Mironov 2009 suffers a challenge in deriving SM over organic soils, as it does not account for the impact of soil organic matter (SOM) on the soil bulk dielectric constant. To this end, we presented a comparative performance analysis of nine advanced soil dielectric models over organic soil in Alaska, four of which incorporate SOM. In the framework of the SMAP single-channel algorithm at vertical polarization (SCA-V), SM retrievals from different dielectric models were derived using an iterative optimization scheme. The skills of the different dielectric models over organic soils were reflected by the performance of their respective SM retrievals, which was measured by four conventional statistical metrics, calculated by comparing satellite-based SM time series with in-situ benchmarks. Overall, SM retrievals of organic-soil-based dielectric models tended to overestimate, while those from mineral-soil-based models displayed dry biases. All the models showed comparable values of unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and Pearson Correlation (R), but Mironov 2019 exhibited a slight but consistent edge over the others. An integrated consideration of the model inputs, the physical basis, and the validated accuracy indicated that the separate use of Mironov 2009 and Mironov 2019 in the SMAP SCA-V for mineral soils (SOM {\textless}15\%) and organic soils (SOM {\textgreater}= 15\%) would be the preferred option.

TI  - Field scale soil water prediction based on areal soil moisture measurements using cosmic-ray neutron sensing in a karst landscape
VL  - 605
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a newly-developed method for continuously measuring soil water content (SWC) at the hectometer horizontal scale. However, it is unknown whether CRNS-based SWC could be used for soil moisture prediction at field scale. In this study, we try to predict field scale SWC using the CRNS combined with the temporal stability analysis in a karst watershed. The CRNS was installed in a karst watershed as well as capacitance-based SWC sensors located in five land uses. The CRNS was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling procedures. A weather station was established about 200 m away from the CRNS for monitoring basic meteorological variables. The mean footprint radius and effective depth of the CRNS were 311.51 m and 11.98 cm, respectively. The CRNS can accurately estimate intermediate scale soil moisture, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89. Significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.01) were observed between SWC measured by the CRNS and Em-50 instruments. Though the SWC derived from the CRNS was significantly lower than that from Em-50 instruments in different land uses, the SWCs at field scale can be predicted accurately. The influences of landforms and land uses on prediction accuracy were not obvious from our data. The CRNS has great potential to improve water resources management in areas with greater heterogeneity. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A {Dense} {Soil} {Moisture} and {Freeze}-{Thaw} {Monitoring} {Network} in the {Qinghai} {Lake} {Basin} on the {Qinghai}-{Tibetan} {Plateau
VL  - 105
SN  - 0003-0007
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and soil freeze-thaw (FT) are two relatively active surface parameters that are significant to the sustainable development of the water-land-air-plant-human nexus. Over time, regional or global SM and FT datasets with different spatial resolutions have been developed. In response to the requirements of multiscale product validation and multisource uncertainty tracking, a soil moisture and soil temperature (ST) monitoring network in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB-NET) was established in September 2019. The QLB-NET is characterized by densely distributed in situ sites (82 sites) measuring SM and ST at 5-, 10-, and 30 -cm depths, with 60 sites in a large-scale network covering an area of 36 km x 40 km and 22 sites evenly distributed across two small-scale 1 km x 1 km networks. Quantitative analyses of the in situ measurements show that the QLB-NET can provide stable and reliable ground truth for SM and FT over coarse grid scales, e.g., 36 km x 36 km, 25 km x 25 km, and 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. When statistics are correspondingly performed over 50 out of 54, 25 out of 29, and 25 out of 28 sites, the results are described as follows: 1) the standard deviation of the mean SM varies between 0.0127 and 0.0196 m3 m-3, with the corresponding difference between the upper and lower quartiles being less than 0.02 m3 m-3; 2) the ground freeze-thaw state can be correctly identified with high probabilities ranging from 85.3\% to 100\% on two freeze-thaw transitional dates. The QLB-NET observed datasets are distributed online and will be continuously updated through cooperation with the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn), facilitating product validation and uncertainty tracking, spatiotemporal analysis of SM change and FT transition, optimization of the SM and FT retrieving algorithms and scaling methods, and development of the mountainous microwave radiative transfer model.

TI  - Effects of the new {Priestly}-{Taylor} equation on determining the boundary of {LST}/{FVC} space for soil moisture monitoring
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Land Surface Temperature and Fractional Vegetation Coverage (LST/FVC) space is a classical model in remote sensing of soil moisture (SM). Its most vital issue is the determination of the boundary i.e. dry and wet edges. Visual interpretation and automatic fitting methods are very demanding for the research area. In contrast, theoretical calculation of the boundary has great application potential, where the traditional Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation has been introduced to derive a Sun2016 method. Recently, a new Priestly-Taylor equation was suggested. In order to furtherly improve the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM, we evaluated the new PT equation for boundary determination through deriving a Sun 2021 method. The evaluation was conducted using data from three aircraft experiments for SM observation i.e. SMAPVEX12, SMAPVEX16 in Iowa, and SMAPVEX16 in Manitoba. Simulated data with the Simsphere model was also used. Results demonstrated that the effects of the new PT equation are related to air temperature (Ta). For a certain range of Ta such as from 290 K to 310 K, the Sun 2021 method is close to the Sun2016 method, which implies limited influence of the new PT equation within that range. For Ta out of that range, the Sun 2021 method presented better performance than the Sun2016, which implies stronger suitability of the new PT equation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the new PT equation increases the sensitivity of calculated wet edge to Ta while decreases its sensitivity to the other input variables. For future extensive application, we also explored convenient ways for determining some essential parameters in the Sun 2021 method. The new PT equation has potential to promote the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM, evapotranspiration, drought, etc. Â© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) are entangled, and the retrieval of one of them requires a priori specification of the other one. Due to insufficient observational information, retrieval of LST and SM from passive microwave remote sensing data is often ill-posed, and the retrieval accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, a novel fully-coupled paradigm is developed to robustly retrieve SM and LST from passive microwave data, which integrates deep learning, physical methods, and statistical methods. The key condition of the general paradigm proposed by us is that the output parameters of deep learning can be uniquely determined by the input parameters theoretically through a certain mathematical equation. Firstly, the physical method is deduced based on the energy radiation balance equation. The nine unknowns require the brightness temperatures of nine channels to construct nine equations, and the solutions of the physical method equations are obtained by model simulation. Based on the derivation of the physical method, the solution of the statistical method is constructed using multi-source data. Secondly, the solutions of physical and statistical methods constitute the training and test data of deep learning, which is used to obtain the solution curve of physical and statistical methods. The retrieval accuracy of LST and SM is greatly improved by smartly utilizing the mutual prior knowledge of SM and LST and cross iterative optimization calculations. Finally, validation indicates that the mean absolute error of the retrieved SM and LST data are 0.027 m(3)/m(3) and 1.38 K, respectively, at an incidence angle of 0-65 degrees. A model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and provide a paradigm for retrieval of other geophysical variables. The proposed paradigm not only has physical meaning, but also makes deep learning physically interpretable, which is a milestone in the retrieval of geophysical remote sensing parameters based on artificial intelligence technology.

TI  - Detecting and mapping irrigated areas in a {Mediterranean} environment by using remote sensing soil moisture and a land surface model
VL  - 596
SN  - NA
AB  - Although irrigation practices affect food production and water resource management, with ever more impacting effects under climate change and population increasing scenarios, detailed knowledge of irrigation is still lacking. In fact, explicit information on the spatial occurrence of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often not available, thus making irrigation the missing variable to comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over agricultural areas. Nevertheless, remote sensing techniques can be used to delimit the irrigation extent. In this study, the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped for irrigation in the North East of Spain is investigated; moreover, a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The remote sensing soil moisture data sets used in this study are SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1 km, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) at 1 km and 9 km, Sentinel-1 at 1 km, and ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) at 12.5 km. The 1 km resolution versions of SMOS and SMAP are obtained by downscaling coarser SMOS and SMAP data through the DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) algorithm. The analyses are supported by an additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the SURFEX-ISBA (SURFace EXternalisÃ©e â€“ Interaction Sol BiosphÃ¨re AtmosphÃ¨re) land surface model. Among all the considered data sets, the L-band passive microwave downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area, especially SMAP at 1 km. The proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture from SMAP at 1 km data set agree well (up to 78\%) with the ground truth derived irrigated areas. Furthermore, the method is able to well distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas, thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs.

VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important index of soil drought, and it directly controls the energy balance and water cycle of the land surface. As an indicator and amplifier of global warming, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is becoming warmer and wetter. Because of its particular geographical environment, large-scale measurements of SM on the TP can only be achieved by satellite remote sensing. The resolution of current SM product of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is 36 km, which is insufficient for many practical applications. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are applied to increase the resolution of SM down to 1 km using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The preliminary results of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by station observations and other reanalysis products. The downscaled results are more consistent with the in situ observations, the Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) from China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) than the original SMAP product. The downscaling algorithm is most effective for grasslands. It is demonstrated that high-resolution SM products can be generated by fusing various features using machine-learning algorithms. Â© 2020.

VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) monitoring is very often intrusive and need onsite personnel to be carried out. The application of remote sensing in SuDS still is an area for further development, especially in vegetation-based techniques, representing a gap in the field. This research proposes an exploratory method combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images data and onsite measurements to develop models of performance. Linear regression models were obtained for the computing of the soil moisture using the following variables: backscatter coefficient (ÏƒÂ°), temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographic wetness index (TWI), reaching medium to high values for its predictive capacity, ranging from 0.53 and 0.66 using ÏƒÂ° and temperature. The most influential variable was found to be the temperature. This investigation opens the path for future research in the use of remote sensing tools in vegetation-based SuDS monitoring with homogeneous plant species, highlighting the need for further research.

TI  - Characteristic bands extraction method and prediction of soil nutrient contents based on an analytic hierarchy process
VL  - 220
SN  - NA
AB  - The selection of characteristic bands of soil nutrients is crucial for the prediction of soil nutrient contents. In this paper, a measurement method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and reflectance spectrum is proposed to realize the extraction of characteristic bands and the prediction of soil nutrients. Firstly, a series of alternative bands are obtained by mathematical transformations and correlation analysis from the reflectance spectral curves of 30 soil samples. Then, to objectively reflect different dependencies of spectral bands on the soil nutrients, AHP is adopted for weight analysis, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) algorithm is used to correct the expert scoring matrix. Via the weight allocation, weight normalization and weight threshold, the alternative bands meeting the sum threshold of weights {\textgreater} 0.5 are finally selected as the characteristic bands of soil nutrients, which are at 484 nm, 512 nm, and 760 nm for total nitrogen (TN), and at 384 nm, 736 nm, and 748 nm for available phosphorus (AP). Finally, three inversion models established by the characteristic bands are used to predict soil nutrient contents, which demonstrated the feasibility of the analytic hierarchy process for the extraction of characteristic bands and the prediction of soil nutrients.

TI  - Lablab purpureus influences soil fertility and microbial diversity in a tropical maize-based no-tillage system
VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - There are multiple mechanisms by which enhanced diversity of plant communities improves soil structure and function. One critical pathway mediating this relationship is through changes to soil prokaryotic communities. Here, nine different cropping systems were studied to evaluate how legume and grass cover crops influence soil fertility and microbial communities in a maize-based no tillage system. The soilâ€™s bacterial and archaeal communities were sequenced (Illumina GAIIx, 12 replicates for treatment) and correlated with eight different soil features. The microbial community composition differed widely between planting treatments, with three primary â€œcommunity typesâ€ emerging in multivariate space: (1) A community type associated with bare soil linked with low P, low pH, and high aluminum [Al]; (2) a community type associated with Lablab beans linked with high soil N, total organic carbon and other base cation concentrations, and high pH; and (3) a community type of all other non-lablab planting arrangements linked with higher soil P (relative to bare soil), but lower soil fertility (N and base cations). Lablab-based arrangements also expressed the highest microbial richness and alpha diversity. The inclusion of Lablab in maize-based cropping systems represents a potential alternative to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and increase the chemical and biological quality in agricultural soils under the no-tillage system.

TI  - Assessing the sensitive spectral bands for soybean water status monitoring and soil moisture prediction using leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance
VL  - 277
SN  - NA
AB  - The stability of soybean yields in Brazil is regularly affected by drought periods, and soil management practices are crucial to expanding the water holding capacity of the soil and providing higher levels of moisture during critical periods, which contribute to increasing crop yields, relieving the need for non-agricultural areas to be converted into croplands. The research reported herein aimed to quantitatively monitor the soil moisture of a soybean crop through leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance and suggest a remote sensing-based approach that might assist in identifying soil management zones. A field experiment at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation during 2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019 cropping seasons had ten soybean genotypes subjected to four water conditions: irrigated, non-irrigated, and water deficit induced at the vegetative or reproductive stages. The soil of the experimental site is characterized as Udox Oxisol. Leaf reflectance (400â€“2500 nm) was collected by the spectroradiometer FieldSpec 3 Jr simultaneously with soil moisture (0â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm depths) at eleven dates. Data submitted to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) evaluated the clustering of water conditions and which are the most critical spectral wavelengths to characterize the plant water status. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was applied to develop a quantitative spectral model to predict soil moisture. The PCA explained over 93\% of the spectral variance within each assessment day, and shortwave infrared wavelengths presented a higher contribution to water status clustering. At the cross-validation step, the PLSR presented R2 up to 0.860 and 0.906 (0â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm) underperforming when soil moisture showed no significant differences between water conditions. Using samples from all assessment days, PLSR presented R2 = 0.609 and 0.722 (0â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm) at the external validation step (RMSE = 2.7 and 1.9, respectively), with a soil moisture range equal to 16â€“35\% and 20â€“35\% at both depths, remarkably outperforming the traditional univariate spectral models. Our results contribute to soil moisture assessment in extensive soybean areas regardless of the stage of crop development and provide a significant contribution since the Brazilian soybean crop calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region. Due to that, soybean plants are rarely at the same phenological stage on a given date in the season. Â© 2022 The Authors

TI  - Monitoring soil moisture at the catchment scale â€“ {A} novel approach combining antecedent precipitation index and radar-derived rainfall data
VL  - 589
SN  - NA
AB  - Knowledge about soil moisture is important for event-based rainfall-runoff models but monitoring conditions at the catchment scale is not a trivial task. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, particularly in dry climates with seasonal and spatially heterogeneous rainfall. Point measurements are difficult to upscale, and remotely sensed (RS) data often lack in spatial or temporal resolution for local or regional studies. Longer latency periods â€“ the time required before data becomes available â€“ of some RS data make them less applicable to time-sensitive analyses such as flash flood forecasting. This study evaluated a novel approach for estimating catchment-scale volumetric soil moisture using an antecedent precipitation index (API) -based model. The model was trained and tested using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected during a 3-month field sampling campaign in a 142 km2 study area in central New Mexico. The calibrated model was applied at the catchment scale to produce soil moisture grids from radar-derived rainfall estimates. Model performance, resolution and latency were compared to satellite-based soil moisture estimates. Benefits of the proposed new method include high spatial resolution (1 Ã— 1 km or less depending on the precipitation data source) and high prediction accuracy (root mean square errors 0.014â€“0.018 m3/m3). Given the short latency period for radar-derived rainfall data, the method has potential for use in operational flood risk assessment and forecasting. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of residual plastic film on crop yield and soil fertility in a dryland farming system
VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Plastic film mulch in agricultural production becomes essential to maintaining crop yields in arid and semiarid areas. However, the presence of residual film in farmland soil has also drawn much attention. In this study, three experiments were conducted. The first two experimental designs included 0, 450, 1 350, and 2 700 kg haâˆ’1 of residual film pieces of approximately 5 cm side length added to field soil (0â€“20 cm soil depth) for seven years and added to pots for four years. In the third experiment, 1 350 kg haâˆ’1 of the residual film with different side lengths (2â€“5, 5â€“10, 10â€“15, and 15â€“20 cm) was added to field soil for six years to explore the effect of residual film fragment size on soil nutrients, soil microorganisms, crop growth and yields. The residual film had little effect on the soil moisture at a field depth of 0â€“2 (or 0â€“1.8) m. There were no significant effects on organic carbon, total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus or available phosphorus in the 0â€“20 cm soil layer. The presence of residual film decreased the richness and diversity of the bacterial community of the surface soil of the residual film, but it had no significant effect on the microbial community of the non-surface soil. The emergence rates of wheat and lentils occasionally decreased significantly with different amounts of residue fragments added to the field. At 450â€“2 700 kg haâˆ’1, the residual film reduced the plant height and stem diameter of maize and significantly reduced the shoot biomass of harvested maize by 11â€“19\%. The average yields of maize and potato over the seven years decreased, but there were almost no significant statistical differences among the treatments. These results provide important data for a comprehensive scientific understanding of the effects of residual film on soil and crops in dryland farming systems. Â© 2023 CAAS.

VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - Low indigenous soil fertility is cited as a major problem in Uganda, where trees are integrated with bananas. Dominant trees were subjected to pruning regimes; 0, 25 and 50\%. Litter decomposition was assessed using 480 bags (4 bags per tree Ã— 4 trees Ã— 3 regimes Ã— 5 sites Ã— 2 seasons). Decomposition was in order Ficus natalensis {\textgreater} Albizia coriaria {\textgreater} Mangifera indica {\textgreater} Artocarpus heterophyllus and highest in the wet season. Sprouting was highest in the dry season. Albizia coriaria had longest sprouts. Based on our results Ficus natalensis and Albizia coriaria should be integrated more and 50\% pruning regime should be done. Â© 2019, Â© 2019 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Possibility of zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery for monitoring salinized soil moisture content using fractional order differentially optimized spectral indices
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The possibility of quantitative inversion of salinized soil moisture content (SMC) from Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery and the application effect of fractional order differentially optimized spectral indices were discussed, which provided new research ideas for improving the accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing inversion. The hyperspectral data from indoor and Zhuhai-1 remote sensing imagery were resampled to the same spectral scale. The soil hyperspectral data were processed by fractional order differential preprocessing method and optimized spectral indices method, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC/r) analysis was made with SMC data. The sensitive optimized spectral indices were used to establish the ground hyperspectral estimation model, and a variety of modeling methods were used to select the best SMC inversion model. The results were as follows: the maximum one-dimensional r between SMC and the 466â€“938 nm band was âˆ’0.635, the maximum one-dimensional r with the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was 0.665, and the maximum two-dimensional r with the difference index (DI) calculated by the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was Â±0.72. The maximum three-dimensional r with the triangle vegetation index (TVI) calculated from the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum reached 0.755, which exceeded the one-dimensional r extreme value of 400â€“2400 nm. The TreeNet gradient boosting machine (TGBM) regression model had the highest modeling accuracy, with a calibration coefficient of determination (R2 C) = 0.887, calibration root mean square error (RMSEC ) = 2.488\%, standard deviation (SD) = 6.733\%, and r = 0.942. However, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model had the strongest predictive ability, with validation coefficient of determination (R2 V) = 0.787, validation root mean square error (RMSEV ) = 3.247\%, and relative prediction deviation (RPD) = 2.071. The variable importance in projection (VIP) method could not only improve model efficiency but also increased model accuracy. R2 C of the optimal PLSR model was 0.733, RMSEC was 3.028\%, R2 V was 0.805, RMSEV was 3.100\%, RPD was 1.976, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) was 151.050. The three-band optimized spectral indices with fractional differential pretreatment could to a certain extent break through the limitation of visible near-infrared spectrum in SMC estimation due to the lack of shortwave infrared spectra, which made it possible to quantitatively retrieve saline SMC on the basis of Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Reduced nutrient mineralization rates under minimum tillage are usually compensated by mineral fertilizer application. These, however, cannot be applied in organic farming systems. We hypothesized that an organic minimum tillage system based on frequent cover cropping and application of dead mulch would improve soil fertility and compensate for the potential negative effects of minimum tillage. Two long-term field experiments were set up in 2010 and 2011 to compare plowing versus minimum tillage including the application of transferred mulch. A second factor, the application of compost versus mineral potassium and phosphorus, was also compared. In 2019, soils were analyzed for soil pH, organic carbon, macro- and micronutrients, microbial biomass, microbial activity, and total nematode abundance. In addition, performance of pea in the same soils was determined under greenhouse conditions. Across both experiments, macronutrients (+52\%), micronutrients (+11\%), microbial biomass (+51\%), microbial activity (+86\%), and bacterivorous nematodes (+112\%) increased in minimum tillage compared to the plow-based system. In the greenhouse, pea biomass was 45\% higher in the soil that had been subjected to minimum tillage compared to the plow. In conclusion, soil fertility can be improved in organic minimum tillage systems, which include intensive cover cropping and the application of dead mulch, over plow-based systems.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas fluxes from maize cropping system under different soil fertility management technologies in {Kenya
VL  - 301
SN  - NA
AB  - Few studies have quantified soil greenhouse gas (GHG) âˆ’CH4, CO2 N2O â€“ annual fluxes directly from smallholder maize cropping systems under different soil fertility management technologies in Sub Saharan Africa. We quantified soil GHG annual fluxes from smallholder maize cropping systems under four different soil fertility management technologies in the Central Highlands of Kenya. We regularly sampled GHG from 2nd March 2018 to 1st March 2019 (1 year) in three maize farms using a static chamber technique. The fertility management technologies were: inorganic fertilizer, animal manure, animal manure combined with inorganic fertilizer, and a Control (No external input). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Cumulative annual soil fluxes ranged from -2.40 kg CH4-C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the control treatment to âˆ’1.62 kg CH4-C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the manure combined with inorganic fertilizer treatment, 4810 kg CO2-C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the control treatment to 6576 kg CO2-C haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 0.21 kg N2O-N haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the control treatment to 0.38 kg N2O-N haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 from the inorganic fertilizer treatment for CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes, respectively. Fertilizer treatment produced the highest CO2 emissions (p {\textless} 0.001), N2O emissions (P {\textless} 0.001), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE), (0.028 g N2O-N kgâˆ’1 grain yield). A combination of manure and inorganic fertilizer produced the highest CH4 fluxes (p = 0.035) across treatments. We concluded that a judicious combination of organic resources (animal manure) and inorganic resources (fertilizer) has the potential to enhance food security while mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions in SSA.

TI  - Multi-sensor approach for tropical soil fertility analysis: {Comparison} of individual and combined performance of vnir, xrf, and libs spectroscopies
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Rapid, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly analysis of key soil fertility attributes requires an ideal combination of sensors. The individual and combined performance of visible and near infrared (VNIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was assessed for predicting clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable (ex-) nutrients in tropical soils. A set of 102 samples, collected from two agricultural fields, with broad ranges of fertility attributes were selected. Two contrasting data fusion approaches have been applied for modeling: (i) merging spectral data of different sensors followed by partial least squares regression (PLS), known as fusion before prediction; and (ii) applying the Granger and Ramanathan (GR) averaging approach, known as fusion after prediction. Results showed VNIR as individual technique to be the best for the prediction of clay and OM content (2.61 â‰¤ residual prediction deviation (RPD) â‰¤ 3.37), while the chemical attributes CEC, V, ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were better predicted (1.82 â‰¤ RPD â‰¤ 4.82) by elemental analysis techniques (i.e., XRF and LIBS). Only pH cannot be predicted regardless the technique. The attributes OM, V, and ex-P were best predicted using single-sensor approaches, while the attributes clay, CEC, pH, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were overall best predicted using multi-sensor approaches. Regarding the performance of the multi-sensor approaches, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg, were best predicted (RPD of 4.98, 5.30, and 4.11 for ex-K, ex-Ca and ex-Mg, respectively) using two-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF for ex-K and XRF + LIBS for ex-Ca and ex-Mg), while clay, CEC and pH were best predicted (RPD of 4.02, 2.63, and 1.32 for clay, CEC, and pH, respectively) with the three-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF + LIBS). Therefore, the best combination of sensors for predicting key fertility attributes proved to be attribute-specific, which is a drawback of the data fusion approach. The present work is pioneering in highlighting benefits and limitations of the in tandem application of VNIR, XRF, and LIBS spectroscopies for fertility analysis in tropical soils.

VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Due to the coarse spatial resolution of currently available microwave (mostly passive) soil moisture (SM) products, it is difficult to apply these SM data in watersheds or at local scales. To this end, a number of downscaling approaches have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of microwave SM products. Specifically, the optical-/thermal-based downscaling methods are most widely used in recent decades. However, such methods normally rely on instantaneous optical/thermal land surface parameters, which are commonly inapplicable under cloudy conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a new downscaling method based on the temporal variation in geostationary satellite-derived land surface temperature and net surface shortwave radiation. The proposed method has a certain potential to improve data availability under cloudy conditions, because geostationary satellites are capable of providing land surface parameters at high temporal resolution. The proposed method was tested over the REMEDHUS network in Spain. The scaling strategy of cumulative distribution function matching was used to remove systematic differences in spatial mismatch between satellite pixels and in situ SM measurements. Results indicate that the downscaled SM agrees well with in situ measurements and has comparable accuracy with the original microwave SM product. The overall root mean square errors with the in situ measurements for the original microwave SM and the downscaled SM are 0.054 and 0.057 {\textbackslash}textm{\textasciicircum}3/{\textbackslash}textm{\textasciicircum}3 , respectively. This method not only has a successful attempt to downscale microwave SM data using temporal information but also has the potential to avoid the failure of traditional instantaneous observations-based downscaling procedure due to clouds.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Many remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products have been developed with global coverage. However, most of them are derived from passive microwave observations with very coarse resolution, greatly constraining the applications at regional scales. To increase the spatial resolution, a downscaling method is developed to downscale the 36-km Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 SM (SMAP SM) product to 1 km using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (8-d land surface temperature, LST, and 16-d normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this method, a linking model is first established between SM and LST and NDVI, and a self-adaptive window method is applied with the use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to obtain an optimal local regression. Then, the uncertainty of the linking model, expressed as the regression residual, is redistributed to fine-resolution pixels to analyze the consistency before and after downscaling. The method was applied to the Iberian Peninsula to produce the 8-d downscaled SM product in 2016. The downscaled SM was validated with the in-situ SM network (REMEDHUS). A good agreement was found between the two data sets, with a correlation coefficient ( R ) of 0.87 and an unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.043 m3/m3 at a network level. At station level, the R is larger than 0.6 for all the REMEDHUS stations, with an ubRMSE smaller than 0.06 m3/m3. The evaluation indicates the good potential of the proposed method in the SM downscaling, which achieves a robust consistency and provides rich spatial information while maintaining good accuracy.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the most important components of all the soil properties affecting the global hydrologic cycle. Optical remote sensing technology is one of the main parts of soil moisture estimation. In this study, we promote a soil moisture-estimating method with applications regarding various soil organic matters. The results indicate that the soil organic matter had a significant spectral feature at wavelengths larger than 900 nm. The existence of soil organic matter would lead to darker soil, and this feature was similar to the soil moisture. Meanwhile, the effect of the soil organic matter on its reflectance overlaps with the effect of soil moisture on its reflected spectrum. This can lead to the underestimation of the soil moisture content, with an MRE of 21.87\%. To reduce this effect, the absorption of the soil organic matter was considered based on the Lambert-Beer law. Then, we established an SMCg-estimating model based on the radiative transform theory while considering the effect of the soil organic matter. The results showed that the effect of the soil organic matter can be effectively reduced and the accuracy of the soil moisture estimation was increased, while MRE decreased from 21.87\% to 6.53\%.

TI  - Cellulose acetate film containing layered double hydroxide: a new method for determination of soil phosphorus availability
VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient availability and interpretations of nutrient contents are based on the results obtained from specific extraction methods used in routine testing laboratories. The development of new extraction methods and new extractants with better accuracy is particularly important to determine the correct fertilizer rates to be applied. For this purpose, this study aims to synthesize, characterize and evaluate the predictive capacity of cellulose acetate film containing calcinated layered double hydroxide (CAF-LDH-c), as a new extractant and a new method of P extraction in soils. Different analyses techniques were used to characterize the CAF-LDH-c sample, including X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy. Soils were collected from twelve areas with different management and initial availability of P. The soils were subjected to six rates of P and were cultivated with plants. The predictive capacity of CAF-LDH-c, as a new extractant of P in different soils, was evaluated and compared to Mehlich-1 (M-1), Mehlich-3 (M-3), and Mixed Exchange Resin (MER) extractants. Chemical analyses performed on CAF-LDH-c showed that LDH in powder form was incorporated into the cellulose acetate film. There was a linear relation between P uptake by plants and extractable soil P in the soil by CAF-LDH-c, M-1, M-3, and MER extractants. The significant correlations between extracted P in the soil and P uptake by plants for CAF-LDH-c showed the efficacy of the new extractor and the newly proposed method for different types of soils. The results from the present study confirm the possibility of using CAF-LDH-c extractant as a new methodology to evaluate the availability of P in the soil for plant cultivation.

TI  - Hyperspectral sensing and mapping of soil carbon content for amending within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility and enhancing soil carbon sequestration
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility is one of the most critical bases for high productivity and sustainability in crop production. Within-field heterogeneity is often problematic in both crop management practices and crop productivity. Besides, appropriate soil management practices leads to the effective carbon sequestration. Since the soil carbon content (SCC) is the most simple and effective indicator of soil fertility, accurate and high-resolution mapping of SCC is an essential basis for addressing these issues. Here, we developed a tractor-based hyperspectral sensing system for speedy and accurate mapping of SCC. A new hybrid spectral algorithm linking normalized difference spectral index (h-NDSI) and machine learning proved superior. Appropriate algorithms were implemented to generate diagnostic map and prescription map from SCC map for the variable-rate application of pellet manure. The field performance of the sensing/mapping system was tested in the farmers' fields in the Fukushima region of Japan where the within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility was disastrous due to the decontamination after the nuclear power-plant disaster. The structure and functioning of the system proved promising. Moreover, the spatial simulation by linking the SCC data and a dynamic simulation model clearly showed the significant impact of variable-rate application of pellet manure on the chronosequential change of SCC, within-field heterogeneity, and carbon stock. The systematic linkage of the sensing/mapping system with the variable-rate spreader and dynamic simulation model would be effective for improving soil fertility and soil carbon stock. Applicability of the system will be extended through an extensive validation of the predictive models.

TI  - Improving smallholder farmer's soil nutrient management: the effect of science and technology backyards in the {North} {China} plain
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Purpose: Soil nutrient management and fertilizer use by farmers are important for sustainable grain production. The authors examined the effect of an experimental agricultural extension program, the science and technology backyard, in promoting sustainable soil nutrient management in the North China Plain (NCP). The science and technology backyard integrates farmer field schools, field demonstrations, and case-to-case counselling to promote sustainable farming practices among rural smallholders. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a large-scale household survey of more than 2,000 rural smallholders. The authors used a multivariate regression analysis as the benchmark to assess the effect of the science-and-technology backyard on smallholder soil nutrient management. Furthermore, the authors used coarse exact matching (CEM) methods to control for potential bias due to self-selection and the (endogenous) switching regression approach as the main empirical analysis. Findings: The results show that the science-and-technology backyard program increased smallholders' wheat yield by approximately 0.23 standard deviation; however, no significant increase in maize yield was observed. Regarding soil nutrient use efficiency, the authors found a significant improvement in smallholders' phosphorus and potassium use efficiencies for both wheat and maize production, and a significant improvement in nitrogen use efficiency for wheat production, but no significant improvement of nitrogen use efficiency for maize production. Originality/value: This study evaluated a novel participatory agricultural extension model to improve soil nutrient management practices among smallholders. The integration of agronomists' scientific knowledge and smallholders' local contextual experiences could be an effective way to improve farmers' soil nutrient management. This study provides the first quantitative estimates based on rigorous impact assessment methods of this novel extension approach in rural China.

TI  - Evaluating and improving the sand storm numerical simulation performance in {Northwestern} {China} using {WRF}-{Chem} and remote sensing soil moisture data
VL  - 251
SN  - 0169-8095
AB  - This paper aims to test the ability of the WRF-Chem model to simulate sand storms in Northwest China and improve the simulation results by introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem. We conducted sensitivity tests, including parameterization scheme tests and soil moisture tests using WRF-Chem. By comparing various combinations of parameterization schemes, which have considerable impacts on sand emissions, the most suitable parameterization scheme for WRF-Chem to simulate sand storms in Northwest China was selected for establishing models in future research. Based on the optimal combination of parameterization schemes, the sensitivity of sand emissions to soil moisture was tested, indicating that soil moisture has a substantial influence on sand emissions and revealing a nonlinear relationship between sand emissions and soil moisture. Although sand simulations are sensitive to soil moisture, the sand emission volume does not always increase with decreasing soil moisture content. Moreover, the soil moisture content simulated by WRF-Chem is quite different from that observed by satellites. Therefore, we selected ten sand storms that occurred in Northwest China in 2009-2018, including weak, moderate and strong sand storms, to explore the responses of sand storms of different intensities to soil moisture. Some experiments were conducted in two scenarios: scenario A was simulated only by WRF-Chem, and scenario B was designed by replacing the initial soil moisture field in WRF-Chem with soil moisture satellite data from AMSR2 and AMSR-E. Comparing the simulation results with in-situ ground-based and satellite-based measurements indicates that WRF-Chem can capture strong sand storms and some moderate sand storms, but the ability to simulate weak sand storms needs to be greatly improved. After introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem, the simulation of sand emissions becomes more accurate, substantially improving the simulation results. Among the ten simulated sand storms, the AOD (aerosol optical depth) and PM10 simulation accuracies are improved for five and seven sand storms, respectively. After this improvement, the AOD correlation coefficient can reach 0.63, and the PM10 correlation coefficient can reach 0.60.

TI  - Statistical modelling of drought-related yield losses using soil moisture-vegetation remote sensing and multiscalar indices in the south-eastern {Europe
VL  - 236
SN  - NA
AB  - Meteorological and agricultural information coupled with remote sensing observations has been used to assess the effectiveness of satellite-derived indices in yield estimations. The estimate yield models generated by both the regression (MLR) and Bayesian network (BBN) algorithms and their levels of predictive skill were assessed. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), soil water index (SWI), standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) have been considered predictors for three rainfed crops (maize, sunflower and grapevine) grown in 37 districts in the Republic of Moldova (RM). We used the weekly EVI2, which was collected by MODIS instruments aboard the Terra satellite with a 250m Ã— 250m spatial resolution and aggregated for each district during the 2000â€“2018 period. We also used the weekly SWI, which was collected from the ASCAT instruments with a 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution and aggregated for each district at the topsoil (0â€“40 cm; SWI-12) and the root-zone layer (0â€“100 cm; SWI-14) during 2000â€“2018. The multiscalar SPEI during 1951â€“2018 farming years proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the yield assessment. The study also summarized (i) the optimal time window of satellite-derived SWIi and EVI2i for yield estimation, and (ii) the capability of remotely sensed indices for representing the spatioâ€“temporal variations of agricultural droughts. We developed statistical soil-vegetation-atmosphere models to explore drought-related yield losses. The skill scores of the sunflower MLR and BBN models were higher than those for the maize and grape models and were able to estimate yields with reasonable accuracy and predictive power. The accurate estimation of maize, sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest (RMSE of âˆ¼1.2 tha-1). Despite the fact that summer crops (maize, sunflower) are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth, however, the SWI-12 had the stronger correlation with crop yield, then SWI-14. This explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and SWI-12, which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil. In any case, all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season, with SWI-12 performing better than SWI-14. Based on the crop-specific soil moisture model, we found that topsoil moisture declines in the most drought-susceptible crop growth stages, which indicates that RM is a good candidate for studying drought persists as main driver of rainfed yield losses in the south-eastern Europe.

VL  - 11
SN  - 2045-2322
AB  - Monitoring the temporal and spatial variation of soil properties is helpful to understand the evolution of soil properties and adjust the management method in  time. Soil fertility evaluation is an urgent need to understand soil fertility  level and prevent soil degradation. Here, we conducted an intensive field  investigation in Chinese hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg.) plantation to clarify  the spatial and temporal variation of soil properties and its influencing  factors, and to evaluate the change of soil fertility. The results showed that  the soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly increased from 2008 to  2018, while available nitrogen (AN) significantly decreased from 2008 to 2018.  The semi-variance revealed that except available phosphorus (AP), the spatial  dependencies of soil properties increased from 2008 to 2018. An increasing  south-north gradient was found for soil AN, AP, available potassium (AK) and SOC  and a decreasing south-north gradient was found for soil pH. The average soil  fertility in the whole area was increased from 2008 to 2018. Our findings  demonstrated that the changes of the management measures were the reason for the  change of soil properties from 2008 to 2018. Therefore, rational fertilization  strategies and sod cultivation are recommended to maintain the long-term  development of the producing forest.

TI  - The use of remote sensing indices to understand flood-recharged soil moisture impacts on trees in semi-arid floodplains: {A} review
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM) and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic, ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore, available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Multi-source soil moisture (SM) products provide a vigorous tool for the estimation of soil moisture on a large scale, but it is crucial to carry out the evaluation of those products before further application. In the present work, an evaluation framework on multi-source SM datasets over central and eastern agricultural areas of China was firstly proposed, based on a dense in situ SM monitoring network of 838 stations from 11 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. Each station adopted the most accurate gravimetric method for measuring the actual soil moisture. The effects of land use types and wet-dry conditions on the performances of multi-source SM products were further analyzed. Most satellite/reanalysis SM products could capture the spatial-temporal changes in soil moisture, especially for ERA5 products that matched the closest to the station-measured SM; by contrast, those satellite products showed poor spatial-temporal performances. Such phenomenon was also quantitatively demonstrated by the four statistical metrics correlation coefficient (CC), p-value, bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) between the satellite/reanalysis SM products and the ground-observed SM series. Further, most satellite/reanalysis SM products had poor performances in Forestland and Grassland areas, with a lower CC and a larger positive bias and RMSE. Such overestimation on soil moisture is possibly influenced by the inestimable parameter vegetation geometry and the vegetation water content in the radiative transfer models. The arid areas showed the worst CC between the station-observed SM data and different satellite/reanalysis SM products; meanwhile, the humid and semi-arid areas presented larger SM estimation errors than the other areas, especially for the satellite products. The fairly dry surface soil (arid area) and open water surface contamination (humid area) are suggested to hinder the reading of microwave-based retrieval systems. Additionally, the reanalysis SM products outperformed the satellite SM products in the evaluated areas, with better spatial-temporal performances, seasonality reflection and higher accuracy on SM estimation (higher CC, and lower bias and RMSE). This is because the reanalysis datasets assimilated various sources of datasets, especially the ground-observed data, with high quality. The evaluated results could provide guidance for fusing different satellite/reanalysis products, as a new feasible alternative to monitoring SM information in the future.

TI  - Irrigation characterization improved by the direct use of {SMAP} soil moisture anomalies within a data assimilation system
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Prior soil moisture data assimilation (DA) efforts to incorporate human management features such as agricultural irrigation has only shown limited success. This is partly due to the fact that observational rescaling approaches for bias correction used in soil moisture DA systems are less effective when unmodeled processes such as irrigation are the dominant source of systematic biases. In this article, we demonstrate an alternative approach, i.e. anomaly correction for overcoming this limitation. Unlike the rescaling approaches, the proposed method does not scale remote sensing soil moisture retrievals to the model climatology, but it extracts the temporal variability information from the retrievals. The study demonstrates this approach through the assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission into the Noah land surface model. The results demonstrate that DA using the anomaly correction method can better capture the effect of irrigation on soil moisture in agricultural areas while providing comparable performance to the DA integrations using rescaling approaches in non-irrigated areas. These findings emphasize the need to reduce inconsistencies between remote sensing and the models so that assimilation methods can employ information from remote sensing more directly to develop representations of unmodeled processes such as irrigation.

SN  - 2045-2322
AB  - In view of the problems of low straw decomposition rates and reduced soil fertility in southern Liaoning, China, we investigated the effects of no-tillage  mode (NT), deep looseningâ€‰+â€‰deep rotary tillage mode (PT), rotary tillage mode  (RT) and the addition of decomposing agent (the next is called a decomposer)  (NTâ€‰+â€‰S, PTâ€‰+â€‰S, RTâ€‰+â€‰S) on the decomposition proportion of straw, respectively,  by using the nylon net bag method in combination with 365-day field plot  experiments. The decomposition rules of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as  well as the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil microbial biomass carbon  (MBC) and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in straw returned to the field for  15, 35, 55, 75, 95, 145 and 365Â days were analyzed. The results showed that in  the short term, the decomposition of straw was better in both the rotray tillage  and deep looseningâ€‰+â€‰deep rotary modes than in the no-tillage mode, and the  addition of decomposer significantly promoted the decomposition of straw and the  release of carbon from straw, among them, the RTâ€‰+â€‰S treatment had the highest  straw decomposition proportion and carbon release proportion in all sampling  periods. After a one year experimental cycle, the RTâ€‰+â€‰S treatment showed the  highest proportion of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin decomposition with  35.49\%, 84.23\% and 85.50\%, respectively, and soil SOC, MBC and DOC contents were  also higher than the other treatments with an increase of 2.30Â gÂ kg(-1),  14.22Â mgÂ kg(-1) and 25.10Â mgÂ kg(-1), respectively, compared to the  pre-experimental soil. Our results show that in the short term, to accelerate the  decomposition rate of returned straw and increase the content of various forms of  carbon in soil, rotary tillage can be used to return the straw to the field,  while also spraying straw decomposer on its surface. This experiment used a new  straw decomposer rich in a variety of microorganisms, combined with the  comparison of a variety of straw return modes, and in-depth study of straw  decomposition effects of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Thus, a scheme that  can effectively improve the decomposition rate of straw and the content of  various forms of organic carbon in soil within a short period of time was  explored to provide theoretical support for the southern Liaoning.

VL  - 13

AB  - The growth of cover crops can contribute to the increase in phosphorus content at depth by root decomposition. The aim of this work was to verify the effect of cover crops on soil phosphorus availability and use by successive plants, and the accumulation of soil P in a no-tillage system conducted for 14 years. This research was carried out during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 crop seasons, whose treatments have been installed and maintained since 2003. The experimental design was a randomized block design, and the plots consisted of spring crops: pearl millet, forage sorghum, sunn hemp, and additionally, a fallow/chiseling area. The evaluation of available P was determined by P fractionation. In general, in the two years of evaluation, the accumulation of P in the shoot dry matter was higher in sunn hemp growth, on average 25\% higher than pearl millet in 2016 and 40\% higher than sorghum in 2017. The highest contents of labile inorganic P were in the sorghumâ€“soybean and fallow/chiselingâ€“soybean successions, with values higher than 50 mg kgâˆ’1 of P in the 0â€“0.1 m soil layer. However, in the other layers analyzed, the cover crops obtained higher availability of labile inorganic P. The systems using cover crops recovered 100\% of the P fertilized in soybean.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is one of the factors affecting plant growth. Methods involving direct soil moisture measurement in the field or requiring laboratory tests are commonly used. These methods, however, are laborious and time-consuming and often give only point-by-point results. In contrast, SSM can vary across a field due to uneven precipitation, soil variability, etc. An alternative is using satellite data, for example, optical data from Sentinel-2 (S2). The main objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of SSM determination based on S2 data versus standard measurement techniques in three different agricultural areas (with irrigation and drainage systems). In the field, we measured SSM manually using non-destructive techniques. Based on S2 data, we estimated SSM using the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) and calculated eighteen vegetation indices. Using the OPTRAM model gave a high SSM estimating accuracy (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.06). The use of soil porosity in the OPTRAM model significantly improved the results. Among the vegetation indices, at the NDVI {\textless}= 0.2, the highest value of R-2 was obtained for the STR to OPTRAM index, while at the NDVI {\textgreater} 0.2, the shadow index had the highest R-2 comparable with OPTRAM.

TI  - A {GNSS}-{IR} soil moisture retrieval method via multi-layer perceptron with consideration of precipitation and environmental factors
VL  - 28
SN  - 1080-5370
AB  - Soil moisture monitoring is a significant aspect of environmental and agricultural studies, and Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) has emerged as a promising technology for this purpose. Traditionally, GNSS-IR is mainly employed for bare soil experiments, and the effectiveness of bare soil retrieval algorithm will be reduced due to the influence of vegetation and meteorological, etc. To address the limitations of the bare-soil retrieval algorithm, a multi-feature soil moisture retrieval approach was proposed. This approach integrated multiple factors including GNSS signals, cumulative precipitation, effective reflection height, and Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI), and then multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was employed to build retrieval models. In this study, measurements from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) H2O networks and a self-built site in Henan, China were used for experiments and validation, and the geographical environment of stations are various. The experimental results demonstrated several key findings: (1) The delay phase is not sensitive to the variations in soil moisture before and after precipitation, but by integrating the cumulative precipitation data, the accuracy of the model could be improved. (2) The introduction of NMRI and reflection height can help remove the influence of vegetation and penetration depth. (3) Compared between three retrieval models (i.e., unary linear regression, multiple linear regression, and MLP), the decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) of MLP is up to 96\% most and the mean coefficient of determination (R2) is all above 0.98. Meanwhile, this study proved that the proposed method could fully utilize satellite reflection signals from all directions and better reflect the fluctuation of soil moisture.

TI  - A synergic method of {Sentinel}-1 and {Sentinel}-2 images for retrieving soil moisture content in agricultural regions
VL  - 190
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing techniques, which provide timely and accurate soil moisture information to improve food production, are becoming increasingly popular among agricultural production in China and many other regions. It also shows its importance in monitoring agricultural basins where the meteorological and topographic conditions vary greatly. In this case, the reliability of soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring for theses basins could be promised. The main objective of this paper is to develop a synergic method of radar and optical data, as well as an on-site sampling scheme, to accurately estimate SMC in the basin. The reason is that in the winter wheat production area of Dawen River basin in China, there are few conventional SMC testing equipment. Considering the characteristics of different crops and the conditions of crops in different growth periods, the VV polarization mode of Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was used to retrieve SMC. Combined with the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from Sentinel-2 MSI optical images and the optimized Water Cloud Model (WCM), the surface backscattering coefficient was obtained by eliminating vegetation moisture content (VMC), and the SMC model was established. The results showed that from March to May in 2020, the coefficient of determination (R2) between the estimated VMC and the field observation was 0.655, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the two was 0.334. In the inversion algorithm model, the R2 between the retrieved SMC and the field measurement was 0.506, and the RMSE was 3.725. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rational use of correctives and fertilizers in banana orchards depends on reliable standards for interpreting soil fertility. The study aimed to establish critical levels (CL) for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil of banana plantations in Santa Catarina, using the Boundary Line (BL) method. A database with information of soil chemical analysis and fruit yield obtained from orchards in producing regions was used. Scatter plots were obtained relating P and K concentration in the soil extracted by the Mehlich-1 method with the relative productivity of fruits and then the pairs of data in the upper border were selected and used to establish a mathematical model. The model was derived and obtained the concentrations of P and K in the soil that provided the maximum physical productivity (100 \%) and maximum economic productivity (90\% of the maximum production), corresponding to the CL in the soil. It is proposed that the update of critical levels of P and K for banana cultivation in Santa Catarina to be 85 and 229 mg/dm3, respectively. The banana grower will be able to suppress the P and K doses in a punctual and temporary way in areas of built fertility with the proper monitoring of productivity, soil and leaf analysis.

VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - Quantityâ€“intensity curves were used to evaluate the dynamics of soil potassium (K) at different soil depths under different K management. The equilibrium concentration ratio of K (CR0) increased with increasing K concentration. K fertilization and straw return increased soil K supplying capacity by increasing CR0, non-specific available K (-âˆ†K0) and equilibrium K (CK0). The CR0 increase 107\%, 392\% and 577\% at the 0â€“20 cm layer and 55\%, 102\% and 131\% at the 20â€“40 cm layer, respectively, under K fertilization, straw return and the interaction of them. The CK0 and -âˆ†K0 at the 0â€“20 cm layer significantly increased after K fertilization and straw return. The labile K varied from 0.11 to 0.19 cmol kgâˆ’1, contributed 85.3\% to 107.6\% of NH4OAc extracted K. Soil K potential buffering capacity showed significant differences in soil depths, while little difference was observed under different K management. Th e exchangeable K was meaningless for guiding K application when minimum exchangeable K took up 85.9\% to 99.0\% of equilibrium exchangeable K. Our results showed K fertilization and straw return was the optimal management to enhance soil K supplying capacity, especially at the 0â€“20 cm layer.

TI  - Interactions between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil-moisture-based indices to characterize drought with high-resolution remote sensing and land-surface model data
VL  - 22
SN  - 1561-8633
AB  - The Iberian Peninsula is prone to drought due to the high variability in the Mediterranean climate with severe consequences for drinking water supply, agriculture, hydropower and ecosystem functioning. Because of the complexity and relevance of droughts in this region, it is necessary to increase our understanding of the temporal interactions of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture that originate from drought within the Ebro basin, in northeastern Spain, as the study region. Remote sensing and land-surface models provide high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution data to characterize evapotranspiration and soil moisture anomalies in detail. The increasing availability of these datasets has the potential to overcome the lack of in situ observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In this study, remote sensing data of evapotranspiration from MOD16A2 and soil moisture data from SMOS1km as well as SURFEX-ISBA land-surface model data are used to calculate the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) and the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) for the period 2010-2017. The study compares the remote sensing time series of the ETDI and SMDI with the ones estimated using the land-surface model SURFEX-ISBA, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI) computed at a weekly scale. The study focuses on the analysis of the time lags between the indices to identify the synchronicity and memory of the anomalies between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Lag analysis results demonstrate the capabilities of the SPI, ETDI and SMDI drought indices computed at a weekly scale to give information about the mechanisms of drought propagation at distinct levels of the land-atmosphere system. Relevant feedback for both antecedent and subsequent conditions is identified, with a preeminent role of evapotranspiration in the link between rainfall and soil moisture. Both remote sensing and the land-surface model show capability to characterize drought events, with specific advantages and drawbacks of the remote sensing and land-surface model datasets. Results underline the value of analyzing drought with dedicated indices, preferably at a weekly scale, to better identify the quick self-intensifying and mitigating mechanisms governing drought, which are relevant for drought monitoring in semi-arid areas.

TI  - Synergetic utilization of sentinel-1 {SAR} and sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data for surface soil moisture estimation for {Rupnagar}, {Punjab}, {India
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Due to improper agricultural and soil management, there has been a drop in crop yield over the last few years and food security has become a major issue. For a country like India, with a huge population to cater, the problem becomes more serious. Since the inception of remote sensing in scientific agriculture management, optical remote sensing along with field data has been used for soil health monitoring and mapping. SAR or microwave remote sensing has an all-weather and high temporal data availability which has found applications for various domains. For soil health studies of multiple soil classes and sub-classes of same type, both aerial and spaceborne SAR remote sensing is currently in use for a multitude of monitoring and parameter modelling approaches. This study utilizes Sentinel 1A, C-band SAR remote sensing data with VV and VH polarization channels for surface soil moisture estimation for alluvial soil and its sub-types in Rupnagar of Punjab state in India. While Index based OLS Regression method for soil moisture estimation was done using backscatter from Sentinel-1A SAR data, it was validated using Normalized Differential Moisture Index (NDMI) generated from Sentinel 2 optical datasets. This approach though did not consider the actual soil moisture data from field yet gave a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.5 and R2-statistics of 0.72 (72\%) in training and testing phases. The Index based OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression method for soil moisture estimation aims to establish a technique for cases when field data is either not available or the study area is not easily accessible. In the statistical approach with field data, the same OLS model, when replaced by on-field surface soil moisture data gave a RMSE of 1.9 and R2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.948 in training and testing phases respectively at 97.5\% confidence level. The study is significant for using freely available optical and SAR remote sensing data parameters synergistically, in a simplified manner for surface soil moisture estimation. The results have comparable accuracies given by studies using commercial data and complex modelling approaches. Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.

VL  - 17
SN  - 1865-0473
AB  - This study investigated the capability of remote sensing soil moisture ( SM) datasets to estimate in- situ SM over the Lake Urmia Basin in Iran. A novel meta-estimating approach, called Voting Regression (VR), was used to combine the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms for developing a new hybrid predictive model named GB- SVR. Six SM products from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) were used to predict SM at 40 in-situ SM sampling locations. The performance of the proposed novel forecasting technique was evaluated using Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results showed the superiority of GB- SVR compared to GB and SVR, with an average improvement of 17\%, 10\%, and 13\% in CC, RMSE, and MAE, respectively, in predicting in-situ SM. The model performance in different climates, soil textures, and land covers showed its better prediction accuracy in croplands (R-2 = 0.86), loam soil (R-2 = 0.74) and cold climate (R-2 = 0.71), while the least in clay soil and barren lands. Besides, the in-situ SM prediction using remote sensing SM data performed better than that obtained using in-situ air and soil temperature. The proposed methodology can be used for accurate SM prediction in regions lacking in-situ SM data.

VL  - 14

AB  - L-band passive microwave remote sensing (RS) is an important tool for monitoring global soil moisture (SM) and freeze/thaw state. In recent years, progress has been made in its in-depth application and development in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) which has a complex natural environment. This paper systematically reviews and summarizes the research progress and the main applications of L-band passive microwave RS observations and associated SM retrievals on the TP. The progress of observing and simulating L-band emission based on ground-, aircraft-based and spaceborne platforms, developing regional-scale SM observation networks, as well as validating satellite-based SM products and developing SM retrieval algorithms are reviewed. On this basis, current problems of L-band emission simulation and SM retrieval on the TP are outlined, such as the fact that current evaluations of SM products are limited to a short-term period, and evaluation and improvement of the forward land emission model and SM retrieval algorithm are limited to the site or grid scale. Accordingly, relevant suggestions and prospects for addressing the abovementioned existing problems are finally put forward. For future work, we suggest (i) sorting out the in situ observations and conducting long-term trend evaluation and analysis of current L-band SM products, (ii) extending current progress made at the site/grid scale to improve the L-band emission simulation and SM retrieval algorithms and products for both frozen and thawed ground at the plateau scale, and (iii) enhancing the application of L-band satellite-based SM products on the TP by implementing methods such as data assimilation to improve the understanding of plateau-scale water cycle and energy balance.

TI  - Multi-source machine learning and spaceborne remote sensing data accurately predict three-dimensional soil moisture in an in-service uranium disposal cell
VL  - 369
SN  - NA
AB  - One reason arid and semi-arid environments have been used to store waste is due to low groundwater recharge, presumably limiting the potential for meteoric water to mobilize and transport contaminants into groundwater. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management (LM) is evaluating selected uranium mill tailings disposal cell covers to be managed as evapotranspiration (ET) covers, where vegetation is used to naturally remove water from the cover profile via transpiration, further reducing deep percolation. An important parameter in monitoring the performance of ET covers is soil moisture (SM). If SM is too high, water may drain into tailings material, potentially transporting contaminants into groundwater; if SM is too low, radon flux may increase through the cover. However, monitoring SM via traditional instrumentation is invasive, expensive, and may fail to account for spatial heterogeneity, especially over vegetated disposal cells. Here we investigated the potential for non-invasive SM monitoring using radar remote sensing and other geospatial data to see if this approach could provide a practical, accurate, and spatially comprehensive tool to monitor SM. We used theoretical simulations to analyze the sensitivity of multi-frequency radar backscatter to SM at different depths of a field-scale (3 ha) drainage lysimeter embedded within an in-service LM disposal cell. We then evaluated a shallow and deep form of machine learning (ML) using Google Earth Engine to integrate multi-source observations and estimate the SM profile across six soil layers from depths of 0â€“2 m. The ML models were trained using in situ SM measurements from 2019 and validated using data from 2014 to 2018 and 2020â€“2021. Model predictors included backscatter observations from satellite synthetic aperture radar, vegetation, temperature products from optical infrared sensors, and accumulated, gridded rainfall data. The radar simulations confirmed that the lower frequencies (L- and P-band) and smaller incidence angles show better sensitivity to deeper soil layers and an overall larger SM dynamic range relative to the higher frequencies (C- and X-band). The ML models produced accurate SM estimates throughout the soil profile (r values from 0.75 to 0.94; RMSE = 0.003â€“0.017 cm3/cm3; bias = 0.00 cm3/cm3), with the simpler shallow-learning approach outperforming a selected deep-learning model. The ML models we developed provide an accurate, cost-effective tool for monitoring SM within ET covers that could be applied to other vegetated disposal cell covers, potentially including those with rock-armored covers.

TI  - A {Theory} of {Maximum} {Entropy} {Production} and {Its} {Application} to {Microwave} {Remote} {Sensing}â€”{Simultaneous} {Retrieval} of {Soil} {Moisture} and {Vegetation} {Water} {Content
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - A theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) for electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric materials is proposed and applied to simultaneously retrieving soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC) from L-band microwave brightness temperature (TB). One representation of the MEP principle states that a non-equilibrium system corresponds to such a configuration of energy fluxes that minimizes a dissipation function under the constraint of energy conservation. The dissipation function for radiative transfer is formulated as an analogy of that for heat transfer. A new physical parameter, radiative inertia as an analogy of thermal inertia, is introduced to characterize radiative attenuation in dielectric media. The radiative inertia is parameterized in terms of the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves as a function of the complex dielectric constant. The MEP based retrieval algorithm predicts SM and VWC by minimizing the dissipation function under the constraint of the conservation of radiative energy. The retrievals of SM and VWC based on the MEP theory were validated against field observations in tropical and temperate forested regions of the Amazon and North America. The proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates the capability of the MEP algorithm for simultaneous retrievals of SM and VWC even for dense canopy (e.g., VWC {\textgreater} 5 kg mâˆ’2). The MEP method is a new theoretical framework for developing innovative remote sensing algorithms of the Earth system not limited to microwave observations. Â© 2024. The Authors.

TI  - Variations in soil nutrient dynamics and their composition in rice under integrated rice-crab co-culture system
VL  - 281
SN  - NA
AB  - Rice-crab co-culture (RC) is an environmentally friendly, agri-aquaculture technique, however, its knowledge about soil nutrients status and their composition in rice grain has remained unexplored. The aim of current study is to explore this deficiency. Thus, a field survey and a field experiment were combinedly carried out at Panjin City, China. The field survey with 16 fields each for rice-monoculture (RM) and RC was conducted without influencing conventional cultural practices. The field experiment was conducted with four treatments: rice-monoculture (RM), 3000 crabs haâˆ’1 without feed (RC3000), 6000 crabs haâˆ’1 with feed (RC6000), and 12,000 crabs haâˆ’1 with 2 Ã— feed (RC12000). Results showed an increase in soil nutrients and improved nutrient accumulation in rice with the RC system. Soil organic carbon, macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg)), microbial biomass carbon, and nitrogen, micronutrients (copper, zinc (Zn), and manganese) were improved. From the field survey, results indicated significant improvement in grain TN (9.4\%), calcium (Ca, 22.1\%), Mg (7.1\%), and Zn (26.1\%) in RC system compared to RM system. In field experiment, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Zn were increased as follows: i) Grain Ca in RC3000 (23.9\%) and RC6000 (17.1\%), ii) Mg in RC3000 (12.6\%), RC6000 (16.3\%), and RC12000 (11.8\%), iii) Zn in RC3000 (10.8\%), RC6000 (5.7\%), and in RC12000 (14.8\%). The RC system has also improved nutrients translocation from soil to plant biomass that was the key reason to increase nutrient composition in rice. The results implied that the improvement of rice yield was by the increased nutrient in soil and the higher nutrient translocation capacity from soil to rice under the proper culturing crab density.

TI  - Soil nutrient deficiency assessment under soybean cropping systems using the {DRIS} system in northern and central {Benin
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Soybean is one of the promising crops in the Benin agro-industrial sector, but its production is carried out at the expense of the inherent soil fertility. The present study aims to apply the DRIS (Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System) for nutrient status assessment in farmersâ€™ soybean fields in northern and central Benin. Sixty-two plant leaf samples were collected during a survey carried out in 2019 in farmersâ€™ fields. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the leaf samples were analysed. DRIS norms were used to calculate the various paired nutrient ratios in the high-yielding population. Nutrient balance indices (NBI) were also determined. Nutrient requirements based on NBI were ranked according Zn {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} Ca {\textgreater} K {\textgreater} Mg, highlighting the importance of Zn and N in soybean nutrition. Paired nutrient ratios (N/P, N/K, Mg/N, N/Ca, Ca/P, K/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zn/Mg) were either significantly (p = 0.0001) higher or lower than those in the literature, excluding Mg/P, Mg/K, P/Zn, Ca/Zn, N/Zn K/Zn and P/K paired ratios. This observation indicates the necessity of calibrating DRIS norms taking into account local conditions and cropping systems. The DRIS model could be an important tool for refining soybean nutrient needs in a cropping system. Zinc and N levels limited soybean cultivation in farmersâ€™ fields and must be included in the soybean fertiliser formulations to ensure optimal yield of soybean in Benin.

TI  - Estimating water balance components in irrigated agriculture using a combined approach of soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, and numerical modelling
VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from irrigation. Â© 2021 The Authors. Hydrological Processes published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing allows for fast and effective soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring. Scale conversion can obtain remote sensing images at multiple resolutions and offer the possibility of improving the estimation accuracy of SMC, which is crucial for precision agriculture. To explore the effect of upscaling conversion on SMC monitoring with UAV remote sensing, multispectral images and SMC data at different soil depths were acquired. The multispectral image with an original spatial resolution of 0.1 m was continuously upscaled to 6 m (with a step of 0.1 m and a total of 60 levels). The correlation coefficient method was adopted to determine the optimal scale, and spectral indices at the original and optimal scales were calculated. SMC inversion models at different depths were constructed at the original and optimal scales by multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural networks (BP), respectively. The results showed that the correlation of UAV multispectral data with SMC displayed a change in first enhancement and then fluctuating weakness with the increase of the upscaled levels. The optimal scale of UAV multispectral remote sensing for monitoring SMC at all soil depths was about 2 m. The BP models were significantly better than the MLR models. For example, in the SMC estimation at 0-20 cm, the RMSE of the BP model was reduced from 0.0110 to 0.0087 (20.9\%). This study can provide theoretical and technical references for improving the accuracy of UAV multispectral remote sensing for SMC monitoring. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Study of soil nitrogen cycling processes based on the {15N} isotope tracking technique in the black soil areas
VL  - 375
SN  - NA
AB  - In recent years, biochar has been widely used for soil improvement, but there has been some variation in its effectiveness; the mechanism of regulating nutrient cycling in soil is unclear due to different soil textures and physicochemical properties of biochar. Therefore, in this paper, the effects of different tillage patterns and biochar gradients on the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen fixation capacity of soybean were monitored in a phased manner by field trials using 15N isotope tracer technology. The results of the study showed that (1) biochar increases the soil's nitrogen fixation capacity by improving the structural stability of the soil. Total nitrogen (TN) content of the soil increased by 42\% after deep ploughing (DP) application of 500 kg/acre of biochar. (2) Biochar improved the nitrogen use efficiency of soybean plants and increased soybean yield. Compared to that of shallow tillage (SP), deep tillage application of 500 kg/acre of biochar increased the nitrogen use efficiency of soybean by 0.62â€“3.45\%. 15N isotope tracking technology showed that soybean plants with deep tillage application of 500 kg/acre of biochar had the highest 15N content at flowering stage; compared to no biochar application, the 15N content of root, stem and leaf fractions increased by 65.4â€“86.9\%. (3) Biochar increased soil CO2 emission fluxes, reduced soil CH4 emission fluxes and soil N2O emission fluxes, with better GHG emission reduction under DP treatment. The regulation model of deep ploughing application of 500kg/acre of biochar provides a reference and guiding meaning for future soil fertility maintenance and farmland soil tillage in black soil areas.

TI  - Improving {UAV} hyperspectral monitoring accuracy of summer maize soil moisture content with an ensemble learning model fusing crop physiological spectral responses
VL  - 160
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) acquisition is vital for crop stress diagnosis and precision irrigation. However, UAV remote sensing-based SMC monitoring usually suffers from low accuracy and spatio-temporal applicability. To address these issues, this study integrated crop physiological spectral response features into an ensemble learning model. A two-year field experiment (2022â€“2023) was conducted. First, fractional-order differentiation (FOD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) were used to enhance the responsiveness of summer maize canopy spectra to SMC and leaf physiological parameters (LPPs), including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf water content (LWC). Afterwards, variable importance in projection (VIP) was adopted to characterize the spectral response properties of each parameter. Finally, a stacked ensemble learning model (SELM) based on Bayesian optimization (BO) was used to construct a SMC monitoring model, and the feasibility of fusing LPP spectral response features for SMC monitoring was evaluated. The results indicated that: (1) Changes in SMC had significant effect on LCC and LAI of summer maize, which in T4 (with field water-holding capacity of 80 \%-95 \%) were 14.07 \% and 34.41 \% higher than that in T1 (40 \%-50 \%), respectively. (2) Spectral transformation could significantly enhance the correlation between SMC and LPPs with canopy spectra (the average increase of R reached 0.23). (3) Consideration of the crop physiology spectral response could improve the SMC monitoring accuracy, the LCC-FOD-BO-SELM had excellent monitoring performance (RÂ²= 0.78; RMSE = 0.019). The monitoring model fusing LPPs spectral response features had the highest accuracy (RÂ²= 0.81; RMSE = 0.016). (4) BO could significantly reduce the overfitting problem of the monitoring model, with the maximum difference between the R2 of the training and test set after BO being only 0.01), thus improving the model's generalizability. This new approach to SMC monitoring using UAV hyperspectral data provide scientific support for precision agriculture and irrigation. Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Sustainable and resilient cropping intensity is now a global focus to address the food demand and nutrition security of the growing population. For sustainable intensification, maintaining soil fertility is a key concern. The nutrient management for the recently developed four crop-based cropping system in Bangladesh has not yet been studied. Hence, field experiments were conducted on the nutrient management of the four crop-based cropping system [Aus (pre-monsoon rice), Aman (monsoon rice), lentil, and mungbean] in calcareous soil in Bangladesh during the years of 2016/17 and 2017/18 to determine the appropriate fertilizer management package to improve crop productivity and sustain soil fertility. The experiment had six treatments assigned in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments included T1 = control (without synthetic fertilizer), T2 = 50\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), T3 = 75\% RDF, T4 = 100\% RDF, T5 = 125\% RDF, and T6 = farmersâ€™ practice (FP). The results revealed that the 125\% RDF significantly contributed to higher yields of all four crops. The rice equivalent yield (REY) was the highest for the fertilizer management of 125\% RDF, which was 45.5\%, 9.4\%, and 12.2\% higher than the control (T1), 100\% RDF (T4), and FP, respectively. Considering the uptake of nutrients (N, P, K, S, Zn, and B) by the crops in the cropping system, the 125\% RDF was superior to the other treatments. The nutrient management practices had a positive influence on the apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) efficiency of the cropping system. The fertilizer management of 125\% RDF was also economically more profitable due to the increment in the costâ€“benefit ratio of 26.8\%, 4.4\%, and 4.9\% over the control, 100\% RDF, and FP, respectively. The results indicate that the current fertilizer recommendations and FP for aus, aman, lentil, and mungbean are not adequate for the change from the three crop to the four crop-based pattern, and an increased dose of fertilizer is required to increase the yield of each individual crop as well as the total systemâ€™s productivity. The fertilizer use efficiency is also higher for 125\% RDF than the 100\% RDF and FP indicating that to sustain the soil fertility in the four cropbased system, the current RDF and FP are not sufficient. This finding will help intensive cropping areas in preventing nutrient deficiencies that would lead to a reduction in the crop yield. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 17
SN  - 1656-4383
AB  - This paper examines the long-term impacts of the joint prawn-rice gher farming system on agricultural and household incomes, soil fertility, and productivity of modern variety (MV) rice in southwestern Bangladesh, based on socioeconomic data of the gher farmers and soil fertility data of their gher plots. In 2005, 20 farmers operating on 30 plots were randomly selected from the Bilpabla village of Khulna from whom prawn and MV rice production data were collected using a questionnaire; soil samples were also collected and tested. In 2011 and 2017, the sustainability of the gher system over time was assessed through another survey of farmers following the same methodology. Results revealed that although the nominal income from gher farming increased by 59 percent in 2011 and 23 percent in 2017, the real income and per capita household income remained unchanged over time. Agricultural income has contributed about 65 percent to household income, which for gher farmers was about 200 percent higher than average rural incomes in Bangladesh. Rice productivity declined slightly from its 2005 level. However, the productivity of MV rice under prawn-rice gher farming is substantially higher than in the conventional MV rice farming system. The positive estimates of the Mean Soil Quality Index and Soil Degradation Index for land used for MV paddy production within the gher indicate an increase in soil nutrients. This suggests that the joint prawn-rice gher farming system is relatively sustainable, having improved soil fertility and stabilized real income. Policy implications toward promoting agricultural growth in the southwestern region of Bangladesh include research on developing varieties of MV rice suited to prawn-rice gher farming and the development of commercial feeds and markets for prawn to further raise productivity and incomes of gher farmers.

TI  - Production potential, economics and soil fertility status of blackgram ({Phaseolus} mungo) as influenced by integrated nutrient supply system
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - A fixed plot field experiment was conducted during two consecutive years (2010-12) at Farm Research, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, to find out the suitable integrated nutrient supply (INS) practice for improving the soil health, yield and profitability of blackgram in Eastern Indo Gangatic plain zone of India. The results indicated that significantly higher grain (948 and 971 kg ha-1), stover (2433 and 2525 kg ha-1), biological (3381and 3496 kg ha-1) yields of blackgram were observed with the application of soil test based NPK+10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha-1 + 1 kg Mo ha-1 over rest of the treatments.With regards to soil fertility after crop harvest, soil test based application of NPK + 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha-1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 resulted in the highest soil available N (223 and 228 kg ha 1), P (21.17 and 22 kg ha-1), K (244 and 247.60 kg ha-1), S (19 and 19.78 kg ha-1) and Mo (0.30 and 0.33 mg kg-1) over other INM treatments. Similarly, soil test based application of NPK + 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha-1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 recorded maximum gross returns (Rs.38584 and 50576 ha-1), net returns (Rs.20624.52 and 32415.09 ha-1) and benefit: cost ratio (2.15 and 2.78) over other nutritional treatments. Hence, study suggested that grower should follow soil test based application of NPK along with 10 t FYM ha-1 + Rhizobium + 30 kg S ha-1+ 1 kg Mo ha-1 for fetching higher profitability from black gram cultivation in Eastern part of Indo Gangatic plains.

AB  - Accurate and continuous monitoring of soil nitrogen is critical for determining its fate and providing early warning for swift soil nutrient management. However, the accuracy of existing electrochemical sensors is hurdled by the immobility of targeted ions, ion adsorption to soil particles, and sensor reading noise and drifting over time. In this study, polyacrylamide hydrogel with a thickness of 0.45 Î¼m was coated on the surface of solid-state ion-selective membrane (S-ISM) sensors to absorb water contained in soil and, consequently, enhance the accuracy (R2{\textgreater} 0.98) and stability (drifting {\textless} 0.3 mV/h) of these sensors monitoring ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-)ions in soil. An ion transport model was built to simulate the long-term NH4+dynamic process (R2{\textgreater} 0.7) by considering the soil adsorption process and soil complexity. Furthermore, a soil-based denoising data processing algorithm (S-DDPA) was developed based on the unique features of soil sensors including the nonlinear mass transfer and ion diffusion on the heterogeneous sensor-hydrogel-soil interface. The 14 day tests using real-world soil demonstrated the effectiveness of S-DDPA to eliminate false signals and retrieve the actual soil nitrogen information for accurate (error: {\textless}2 mg/L) and continuous monitoring.

TI  - Poultry litter biochar increases mycorrhizal colonisation, soil fertility and cucumber yield in a fertigation system on sandy soil
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - There is a continuing argument about the benefits of biochar on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, crop growth, yield, and fertility of soil. There is also limited research on the effects of biochar on AM colonization, cucumber yield, and soil fertility improvement. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the impact of poultry litter biochar (PLB) on colonization of roots by indigenous AM fungi in agricultural soil and their contribution to cucumber yield, nutrition, and soil fertility improvement. A field trial was conducted to assess the effect of PLB combined with compound poultry manure (CPM) and nitrophos (NP) fertilizer to investigate the response of treatments on nutrient-deficient sandy soils. Plant growth responses to biochar showed better plant growth and yield of cucumber. Application of biochar with and without CPM and NP reduced the negative impact of nutrient deficiency stress on cucumber growth. AM fungal colonization, soil fertility, and cucumber yield were improved with the combined application of biochar, CPM, and NP fertilizer. Post-harvest, soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn increased with application of biochar applied with CPM and NP. Biochar application with CPM and NP also increased the percent root colonization of cucumber. Use of biochar with CPM and NP has the potential to improve plant growth, yield, nutrient uptake, and soil fertility. Further studies in various agro-ecological conditions would help utilize this technology in sustainable crop production. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil degradation and high environmental costs impede agricultural production in North China. A 6-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of tillage practice and nitrogen application rate on changes in soil fertility and wheat yield. Four tillage systems (rotary tillage without maize straw return through 6 years, RT; rotary tillage with maize straw return through 6 years, RS; deep tillage with maize straw return through 6 years, DS; and rotary tillage through 2 years followed by deep tillage next year with maize straw applied for two cycles, RS/DS) and three N levels (HN, 300 kg N haâˆ’1, refers to traditional farming practice; MN, 0.75 Ã— HN, 225 kg N haâˆ’1, to recommended N rate; and LN, 0.5 Ã— HN, 150 kg N haâˆ’1, to reduced N rate) were tested. The soil organic carbon, labile organic carbon, inorganic N, available phosphorus, and available potassium under straw return treatments were significantly higher than RT in the 0â€“30 cm soil layer (p {\textless} 0.05). The microbial diversity, invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase activities also increased when maize straw was returned. Tillage practices could distribute maize straw in different depths of the soil and then affect soil nutrients, enzyme activity, and microbial diversity. The RS treatment presented the greatest effects in the 0â€“10 cm layer, while more significant impacts were observed in DS and RS/DS treatments at the 10â€“30 cm depths. The levels of soil nutrients and enzyme activity increased with an increased N rate. Compared to that under LN, wheat yields increased under HN and MN treatments, whereas there were no significant differences between HN and MN (p {\textgreater} 0.05). An increasing tendency of grain yield was observed in DS and RS/DS, while conversely so in RS. RS/DS had lower farm costs than DS during the study duration. Thus, RS/DS at 225 kg N haâˆ’1 is the best method for improving soil fertility and wheat yield. Â© 2023 by the authors.

VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility and water use are two important aspects that influence rice productivity. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of in-situ (sesbania and rice bean) and ex-situ (subabul) green manuring along with zinc fertilization on water productivity and soil fertility in rice under riceâ€“wheat cropping system at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India. Sesbania incorporation recorded higher total water productivity (2.20 and 3.24 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1), available soil nutrients, organic carbon, alkaline phosphatase activity, microbial biomass carbon and increased soil dehydrogenase activity by 39.6 and 26.8\% over subabul and rice bean respectively. Among interaction of green manures and zinc fertilization, subabul Ã— foliar application of chelated zinc-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after transplanting recorded highest total water productivity (2.56 and 3.79 kg haâˆ’1 mmâˆ’1). Foliar application of chelated Zn-EDTA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days after transplanting recorded significantly higher water productivity than other Zn treatments, however it was statistically similar with foliar application of zinc at active tillering + flowering + grain filling. Sesbania Ã— 5 kg Zn haâˆ’1 through chelated Zn-EDTA, recorded highest available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, manganese, copper and iron than other green manure and Zn fertilization interactions, although it was statistically similar with rice bean Ã— 5 kg Zn haâˆ’1 through chelated Zn-EDTA as soil application. Sesbania Ã— foliar application of 5 kg Zn haâˆ’1 through chelated Zn-EDTA as soil application recorded highest soil enzymatic activities and microbial biomass carbon.

TI  - Liming reduces soil phosphorus availability but promotes yield and {P} uptake in a double rice cropping system
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Liming is often applied to alleviate soil acidification and increase crop yield on acidic soils, but its effect on soil phosphorus (P) availability is unclear, particularly in rice paddies. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of liming on rice production, yield and P uptake in a three-year field experiment in a double rice cropping system in subtropical China. We also conducted an incubation experiment to investigate the direct effect of liming on soil available P and phosphatase activities on paddy soils in the absence of plants. In the incubation experiment, liming reduced soil P availability (measured as Olsen-extractable P) by 14â€“17\% and inhibited the activity of soil acid phosphatase. Nonetheless, lime application increased grain yield, biomass, and P uptake in the field. Liming increased grain yield and P uptake more strongly for late rice (26 and 21\%, respectively) than for early rice (15 and 8\%, respectively). Liming reduced the concentration of soil available P in the field as well, reflecting the increase in rice P uptake and the direct negative effect of liming on soil P availability. Taken together, these results suggest that by stimulating rice growth, liming can overcome direct negative effects on soil P availability and increase plant P uptake in this acidic paddy soil where P is not the limiting factor.

TI  - Soil phosphorus availability and utilization are mediated by plant facilitation via rhizosphere interactions in an intercropping system
VL  - 142
SN  - NA
AB  - We hypothesized that soil phosphorus (P) utilization might be tightly associated with interspecific interactions. To clarify this issue, a maize-grass pea intercropping system was investigated in a rainfed field with P addition (P0 and P +), water (rain-fed and plastic film mulching) and isolation (root barrier and root intermingling) treatments. The data indicated that total net effect was higher than 0 under all the conditions, displaying facilitative effects of biodiversity on agroecosystem productivity. The dynamics of total land equivalent ratio demonstrated that the intensity of plant-plant facilitation became greater under P-deficient condition. Maize was the facilitated species consistently, while grass pea changed from facilitated species under low soil P and moisture to facilitator under high soil P and moisture. The driving mechanism was associated with soil acidification and microbial community promotion effect under P-deficient condition. Intercropped rhizosphere soil phosphatase activity was increased by 4.9â€“17.2\%, and Olsen-P availability was evidently enhanced relative to monoculture. Interestingly, drought stress significantly enhanced this trend. Critically, root isolation confirmed that plant-plant facilitation was briefly driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions. Conclusively, this study confirmed the context-dependent facilitation shift in agroecosystem and provided a novel insight into the importance of rhizosphere interaction on soil P availability and utilization.

TI  - A method for estimating spatially continuous soil moisture from the synergistic use of geostationary and polar-orbit satellite data
VL  - 608
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in the surface energy balance and water cycle, and its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance to climate, agriculture and other fields. Optical remote sensing has been widely used to estimate SM with relatively fine spatial resolution. However, optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds, making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous SM over large regions. In the present study, a semimonthly SM dataset over the study area of the entire Inner Mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was derived from the synergistic use of China's Feng-Yun (FY) geostationary (FY-4A) and polar-orbit (FY-3D) observations, following a previously developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel-to-pixel manner. A preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types (grassland and cropland) in the study region, where the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products were provided as references. The results indicated that the estimated SM was well correlated to the referenced SM datasets, with a significant correlation coefficient varying from 0.5 to 0.8. Furthermore, for the grassland (cropland), unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0.062 (0.097) m3/m3 and 0.055 (0.069) m3/m3 can be found when comparing the estimated SM with the CLDAS and the SMAP product, respectively.

VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - A persistent challenge in the measurement of soil moisture from satellites stems from the inherently low spatial resolution using active or passive system. The lobe differencing correlation radiometer (LDCR) on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) is shown to provide a capability to measure soil moisture at high spatial resolution for a range of scientific and operational purposes. Flight tests of LDCR on a fixed wing sUAS were performed at the Canton, Oklahoma Soilscape site in September 2015, and Irrigation Research Foundation (IRF) in Yuma, Colorado, in June 2016. The LDCR design and performance are discussed, and the calibration using both preflight lab test data and in-flight data over a calm pond was performed to calibrate the radiometer. Radio frequency interference (RFI) from the sUAS platform was observed and mitigated. The LDCR sampling processes are detailed and an implementation of the Ï„-Ï‰ vegetation correction model along with a semiempirical surface roughness correction model incorporating a full-domain soil moisture mapping algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses a weakly nonlinear observation operator suitable for irregular sUAS flight trajectories that maps volumetric soil moisture (VSM) on a user-defined product grid from the sUAS sampling grid. Using LDCR radiometric and thermal measurements, along with Landsat-based vegetation water content (VWC) and soil texture information, soil moisture was mapped at decameter spatial resolution. The retrieved VSM data are favorably compared with in situ VSM measurements and irrigation records. A method for determining LDCR VSM estimation errors is developed to quantify the mapping algorithm accuracy and assess the impact of error sources. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Mapping barrier island soil moisture using a radiative transfer model of hyperspectral imagery from an unmanned aerial system.
VL  - 11
SN  - 2045-2322
AB  - The advent of remote sensing from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has opened the door to more affordable and effective methods of imaging and mapping of surface  geophysical properties with many important applications in areas such as coastal  zone management, ecology, agriculture, and defense. We describe a study to  validate and improve soil moisture content retrieval and mapping from  hyperspectral imagery collected by a UAS system. Our approach uses a recently  developed model known as the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil  reflectance (MARMIT). MARMIT partitions contributions due to water and the  sediment surface into equivalent but separate layers and describes these layers  using an equivalent slab model formalism. The model water layer thickness along  with the fraction of wet surface become parameters that must be optimized in a  calibration step, with extinction due to water absorption being applied in the  model based on equivalent water layer thickness, while transmission and  reflection coefficients follow the Fresnel formalism. In this work, we evaluate  the model in both field settings, using UAS hyperspectral imagery, and laboratory  settings, using hyperspectral spectra obtained with a goniometer. Sediment  samples obtained from four different field sites representing disparate  environmental settings comprised the laboratory analysis while field validation  used hyperspectral UAS imagery and coordinated ground truth obtained on a barrier  island shore during field campaigns in 2018 and 2019. Analysis of the most  significant wavelengths for retrieval indicate a number of different wavelengths  in the short-wave infra-red (SWIR) that provide accurate fits to measured soil  moisture content in the laboratory with normalized root mean square error  (NRMSE){\textless} 0.145, while independent evaluation from sequestered test data from the  hyperspectral UAS imagery obtained during the field campaign obtained an average  NRMSE = 0.169 and median NRMSE = 0.152 in a bootstrap analysis.

AB  - Onion is an important vegetable crop, predominantly grown under conventional tillage system management. Alternatively, the vegetable no-tillage system uses cover crops to form a residue layer, which improves soil physical, chemical, and biological attributes. Aiming to understand the interaction of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal cover crops, phosphatase activity, and soil phosphorus availability and uptake by plants, a no-tillage vegetable production system experiment with onion was carried out in Ituporanga, Southern Brazil. The treatments were black oats (Avena strigosa); rye (Secale cereale); oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus); rye + oilseed radish; black oats + oilseed radish, and a control with spontaneous plants. Additionally, two plots, a conventional tillage system area and a forest, both adjacent to the experiment, were evaluated. We measured cover crop biomass, onion yield, acid phosphatase activity, and resin-extracted phosphorus in the soil, shoot and root phosphorus content, and root colonization in cover crops, spontaneous plants, and onions. The treatments with cover crops had the highest plant biomass in winter and onion yield. Available soil phosphorus and acid phosphatase activity were higher in no-tillage plots than in the conventional tillage system area. The presence of non-mycorrhizal oilseed radish was associated with decreased colonization of rye and onion roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. No-tillage areas with cover crops or spontaneous plants in winter accumulated more phosphorus than conventional tillage system areas. The conventional tillage system showed adverse effects on most soil attributes, as shown by a Principal Component Analysis. Â© 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

TI  - Changes in soil phosphorus forms in a long-term cropping system as influenced by fertilization and tillage
VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - Imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers can deteriorate soil quality; however, it can be reversed by organic matter management. Substituting fertilizer N by farmyard manure (FYM) without correcting for extra phosphorus being added could pose an environmental problem. A long-term experiment on rice-lentil cropping system was examined, where N was substituted through FYM without correcting for the P being added. Three fertilizer treatments (100\% inorganic, 50\% organic and 100\% organic fertilization) were superimposed over two tillage treatments (conventional and minimum tillage) in a split plot design in a Typic Haplustepts. P uptake did not correlate to phosphorus application, and partial phosphorus balance (PPB) was positive. Zero PPB was obtained at P application of 11.7 kg haâˆ’1 signifying that all treatments were over-fertilized with respect to phosphorus. Total and available phosphorus increased in response to increase in PPB. Changes in soil phosphorus fractions with depth were compared to control plot and considerable increase in all the P fractions was noticed. P application rate in excess of zero PPB (11.7 kg P haâˆ’1) would increase various soil P fractions, especially soluble P, and could be a reason for concern of P loss to the environment through overland flow or leaching losses to groundwater.

VL  - 119
SN  - NA
AB  - Estimation of soil moisture condition on a local or regional scale is one of the most important problems in vegetation conditions monitoring. One of the most suitable approach to do this over vegetated areas is the Land Surface Temperature â€“ Vegetation Index (LST-VI) Triangle Method. This method estimates water content in soil which is available for plants in contrast to methods using satellite observations in the microwave band, and it is superior to pixel by pixel soil moisture methods using observations in the optical band which neglect statistical relationship between VI and LST controlling evapotranspiration on vegetated area. This study tested a methodological modification of the method based on assumption that evapotranspiration depends on the difference between the air temperature and the terrain surface temperature. The spatial distribution of Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices, which reflect soil moisture in the root zone was calculated for vast areas of Central Europe using the classic Triangle Method and its modified version. Both NDVI and EVI indices were used as input data in these calculations. The air temperature at 2 m height was taken from SYNOP reports, and the terrain surface temperature from MODIS data. In addition, Matlab scripts were written by the authors to allow convenient access to free SYNOP data. Our results indicate that proposed modification increases the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. This was confirmed by comparing classic and modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices values with rainfall data. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Nutrient use efficiency as a strong indicator of nutritional security and builders of soil nutrient status through integrated nutrient management technology in a rice-wheat system in northwestern {India
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Nutrient use efficiency is reported as a strong indicator of the buildup soil nutrient status for nutritional security of crops through an integrated nutrient management approach under a rice-wheat system. The data revealed that integrated application of manures and fertilizers reported maximum organic carbon (0.39\%) in the treatment receiving 100\% of the recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) + farmyard manure and lowering the pH to 6.39. The maximum available N (360.8 kg haâˆ’1) was found in 100\% RDF + press mud treatment; available P (66.30 kg haâˆ’1) was found in 75\% RDF + poultry manure; and available K, Zn, Cu, and Fe (226.3 kg haâˆ’1 and 2.220, 0.732, and 36.87 mg kgâˆ’1, respectively) in 100\% RDF + farmyard manure treatments. Similarly, total macro-and micronutrient content in soil increased with the addition of organic manures alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers. The highest agronomic efficiency and utilization efficiency of nitrogen (41.83 and 102.55 kg kgâˆ’1, respectively) and phosphorous (83.57 and 204.9 kg kgâˆ’1, respectively) were recorded in the treatment receiving 75\% RDF + poultry manure. This study concluded that the integrated application of manures and chemical fertilizers is a must for improving soil nutrient status and nutrient use efficiency and ultimately enhances nutritional security under a rice-wheat system.

TI  - Interaction effects of environmental factors on soil nitrogen fractions based on a novel sequential extraction method
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors. However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction methods. The Harbinâ€“Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N. The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material, aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-, cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs. Highlights: Soil nitrogen fractions (SNFs) were fractionated via a novel sequential extraction method. Increasing MAT decreased the H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N concentrations. Interactions of climate, parent material and vegetation affected 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N. H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl- and cHCl-N are sensitive SNFs that reflect environmental changes.

TI  - Three years of soil moisture observations by a dense cosmic-ray neutron sensing cluster at an agricultural research site in north-east {Germany
VL  - 15
SN  - 1866-3508
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for the estimation of root-zone soil water content (SWC) at the scale of several hectares. In this paper, we present the data recorded by a dense CRNS network operated from 2019 to 2022 at an agricultural research site in Marquardt, Germany - the first multi-year CRNS cluster. Consisting, at its core, of eight permanently installed CRNS sensors, the cluster was supplemented by a wealth of complementary measurements: data from seven additional temporary CRNS sensors, partly co-located with the permanent ones; 27 SWC profiles (mostly permanent); two groundwater observation wells; meteorological records; and Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry (GNSS-R). Complementary to these continuous measurements, numerous campaign-based activities provided data by mobile CRNS roving, hyperspectral im-agery via UASs, intensive manual sampling of soil properties (SWC, bulk density, organic matter, texture, soil hydraulic properties), and observations of biomass and snow (cover, depth, and density). The unique temporal coverage of 3 years entails a broad spectrum of hydro-meteorological conditions, including exceptional drought periods and extreme rainfall but also episodes of snow coverage, as well as a dedicated irrigation experiment. Apart from serving to advance CRNS-related retrieval methods, this data set is expected to be useful for vari-ous disciplines, for example, soil and groundwater hydrology, agriculture, or remote sensing. Hence, we show exemplary features of the data set in order to highlight the potential for such subsequent studies. The data are available at doi.org/10.23728/b2share.551095325d74431881185fba1eb09c95 (Heistermann et al., 2022b).

TI  - Agricultural drought analysis and its association among land surface temperature, soil moisture and precipitation in {Gamo} {Zone}, {Southern} {Ethiopia}: a remote sensing approach
VL  - 117
SN  - NA
AB  - Drought is a multifaceted natural hazard that has an impact on various aspects like; agricultural, hydrological, ecological and socio-economic systems. Drought has been a predominant concern for farmers in Gamo Zone over the last decades; hence, monitoring drought is important for soil conservation, water planning and management to mitigate impacts on agriculture in the Zone. The vegetation indices normal difference vegetation index and vegetation condition index are popular since they are based only on satellite images. The present study attempts to monitoring spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural droughts and its association with land surface temperature, precipitation and soil moisture from the period 2000â€“2020 using remote sensing application method in Gamo Zone. The vegetation condition index (VCI) and Normal difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to evaluate spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural drought in Gamo Zone. The Pearson correlation method was used to identify Normal difference vegetation index association with land surface temperature, soil moisture and precipitation. The results discovered that severe drought to very severe drought was identified in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2015 with the area coverage 39.7\%, 28.8\%, 33.4\%, 24.5\%, 61.3\% and 23.0\%, respectively. Similarly, the findings show that slight to mild droughts have a great chance of occurrence in Gamo Zone. The data also demonstrate that normal difference vegetation index has a strong relationship with land surface temperature (R = âˆ’ 0.95), precipitation (R = 0.65) and soil moisture (R = 0.85), indicating that normal difference vegetation index is more sensitive to land surface temperature than soil moisture and precipitation, although soil moisture has a positive relationship with precipitation (R = 0.60). Therefore, this study revealed that normal difference vegetation index and vegetation condition index indices are suitable for agricultural drought monitoring and they are strongly associated with precipitation, soil moisture and land surface temperature. This study shall be helpful for decision makers to take the necessary measures by considering the drought risk maps for early warning system and future drought management plans.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Climate change affects crops development, pathogens survival rates and pathogenicity, leading to more severe disease epidemics. There are few reports on early, simple, large-scale quantitative detection technology for wheat diseases against climate change. A new technique for detecting wheat stripe rust (WSR) during the latent period based on hyperspectral technology is proposed. Canopy hyperspectral data of WSR was obtained; meanwhile, duplex PCR was used to measure the content of Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) in the same canopy section. The content of Pst corresponded to its spectrum as the classification label of the model, which is established by discriminant partial least squares (DPLS) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In the spectral region of 325â€“1075 nm, the modelâ€™s average recognition accuracy was between 75\% and 80\%. In the sub-band of 325â€“1075 nm, the average recognition accuracy of the DPLS was 80\% within the 325â€“474 nm. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM was 83\% within the 475â€“624 nm. Correlation analysis showed that the disease index of WSR was positively correlated with soil nitrogen nutrition, indicating that the soil nitrogen nutrition would affect the severity of WSR during the latent period.

TI  - An investigation of the accuracy of ec5 and 5te capacitance sensors for soil moisture monitoring in urban soils-laboratory and field calibration
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Recently, emphasis has been placed on finding a reliable estimation of soil water content. In this study, two capacitance sensors EC5 and 5TE (METER Group) were utilized. These sensors provide many benefits relative to other sensors in that they are cost-effective and very economical regarding energy use, operate at a high measurement frequency of 70 MHz, and are dedicated to measuring at a small volume because of their small size. This makes them suitable for the context of use in this research, which consists of multiple sustainable drainage systems SuDS. Several studies have evaluated these two types of sensor but not for urban soils with specific characteristics. In addition, results from the literature are divergent and the published calibration data are limited. Therefore, an in-depth investigation of their accuracy is assessed in this paper. At first, the literatureâ€™s existing procedures and methods were examined. The sensor-to-sensor variability, as well as repeatability, were tested in soil and solutions. Additionally, a field calibration method was conducted to estimate the effects of soil texture on sensors readings. Two laboratory calibration methods having different principles were also applied, compared to each other and to the field calibration as well. Results revealed weak sensor-to-sensor variability (coefficient of variation up to 15\% in soil) and also good repeatability (0.1\%), for both sensors. A soil-specific calibration equation has improved the estimation of the volumetric water content. In case of soil having high field bulk density, the undisturbed soil calibration method described and proposed in this paper gives promising results. The latter method yields a volumetric water content (VWC) prediction accuracy of 0.025 m3Â·mâˆ’3 on a sandy loam soil. This paper presents a large knowledge of capacitance sensors measurement technique as well as their calibration procedures and methods. Limitations of existing procedures have been identified and key elements for selecting the appropriate one are suggested. Derived calibration equations have also been provided for three urban soils with different particle size distribution, ranging from sandy loam to silt loam. Accurate monitoring of soil moisture content in urban soils is thus achievable. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aims to assist farmers in monitoring soil nutrients, especially phosphorus. To measure the phosphorus content of paddy soil, the TCS3200 converter, as an intelligent sensor, was applied. The geographical information system (GIS) was also involved in this research to map the phosphorus content. In addition, the NaÃ¯ve Bayes method was applied to classify lowland soil phosphorus status. The result of this study indicated that the NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithm could classify lowland soil phosphorus status with a probability of 0.34 for moderate phosphorus conditions and 0.66 for high phosphorus conditions. The sample testing results showed that the error rate was 3\% and the success rate was 97\%. Testing with a phosphorus-measuring instrument can be carried out by mapping the soil phosphorus status with the ArcGIS software, whereby seven points of medium-phosphorus-status paddy soil and 13 locations of high-phosphorus-status soil samples were determined. This research thus successfully mapped the soil phosphorus. Â© 2023 Anton Yudhana et al., published by Sciendo.

VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil moisture at the Earth'surface is of great importance for drought early warnings. Spaceborne remote sensing is a keystone in monitoring at continental scale, as satellites can make observations of locations which are scarcely monitored by ground-based techniques. In recent years, several soil moisture products for continental scale monitoring became available from the main space agencies around the world. Making use of sensors aboard polar satellites sampling in the microwave spectrum, soil moisture can be measured and mapped globally every few days at a spatial resolution as fine as 25 km. However, complementarity of satellite observations is a crucial issue to improve the quality of the estimations provided. In this context, measurements within the visible and infrared from geostationary satellites provide information on the surface from a totally different perspective. In this study, we design a new retrieval algorithm for daily soil moisture monitoring based only on the land surface temperature observations derived from the METEOSAT second generation geostationary satellites. Soil moisture has been retrieved from the retrieval algorithm for an eight years period over Europe and Africa at the SEVIRI sensor spatial resolution (3 km at the sub-satellite point). The results, only available for clear sky and partly cloudy conditions, are for the first time extensively evaluated against in-situ observations provided by the International Soil Moisture Network and FLUXNET at sites across Europe and Africa. The soil moisture retrievals have approximately the same accuracy as the soil moisture products derived from microwave sensors, with the most accurate estimations for semi-arid regions of Europe and Africa, and a progressive degradation of the accuracy towards northern latitudes of Europe. Although some possible improvements can be expected by a better use of other products derived from SEVIRI, the new approach developped and assessed here is a valuable alternative to microwave sensors to monitor daily soil moisture at the resolution of few kilometers over entire continents and could reveal a good complementarity to an improved monitoring system, as the algorithm can produce surface soil moisture with less than 1 day delay over clear sky and non-steady cloudy conditions (over 10\% of the time).

TI  - Long-term maintenance of high yield and soil fertility with integrated soil-crop system management on the {Loess} {Plateau
VL  - 351
SN  - NA
AB  - Ridgeâ€“furrow with full ï¬lm mulching has been widely applied to increase crop yield and water productivity on the Loess Plateau, but it may stimulate carbon (C) mineralization. How to integrate other technological benefits based on this technology for long-term maintenance of high yield and soil fertility is a pressing issue. With the local farmersâ€™ practice (FP) as a control, three integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM) practices integrating fertilizer rates, fertilizer types and planting densities (ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN) were established to improve maize yield and soil quality. Compared with the FP, the maize yield increased by 13.34\%, 21.83\% and 30.24\%, and the soil quality index (SQI) increased by 9.66\%, 14.91\% and 38.38\% for ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN, respectively. However, ISSM-N1 did not significantly increase yield, and ISSM-N2 increased residual soil nitrate and decreased nitrogen (N) partial factor productivity significantly. Compared to the FP, ISSM practices increased soil organic carbon (SOC), labile organic C fractions (LOCFs) and potassium permanganate organic C fractions in the topsoil to varying degrees, but only ISSM-MN reached significant levels for most C fractions. The sensitivity index indicated very easily oxidizable C (24.6\%), easily oxidizable C (24.7\%), hot-water extractable C (30.8\%), labile organic C (24.7\%) and particulate organic C (57.3\%) were more sensitive than SOC (22.7\%). ISSM-MN sequestered significantly higher C than the other treatments. The results of the relative importance analysis and the structural equation model indicated that LOCFs were the direct contributors to yield, while recalcitrant C (CO) was the indirect contributor, revealing the underlying mechanism that CO decomposed to replenish LOCFs and the total N pool with the water soluble C pool as the transit station. Overall, ISSM-MN is the most promising strategy to improve crop yield and soil fertility in the long term on the Loess Plateau. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 311
SN  - NA
AB  - Cover crops (CC) increase soil fertility via recycling of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and buildup of soil organic matter, whereby CC contributes to climate change mitigation. The carbon (C) input to soil occurs via the input of plant material (shoot and root) and via phyllo- and rhizodeposition. However, the quantity of phyllo- and rhizodeposition from CC is largely unexamined, although this component potentially has a large contribution to microbial stabilization of C. Isotopic labeling with 13C to trace C flows and 15N to determine N2-fixation was conducted to test the short-term effect of the inclusion of winter vetch as a legume species to a CC mixture. The CC mixtures were established in a long-term experiment (1997â€“2019) with varying use of manure and CC cropping to test the effect of soil fertility on the behavior of the newly established CC mixtures. A significant reduction in the relative net phyllo- and rhizodeposition was observed with higher soil fertility. Interestingly, the quantity of net phyllo- and rhizodeposition was also reduced with higher soil fertility due to the lower relative phyllo- and rhizodeposition, despite a significantly higher CC biomass. Importantly, adjusting for unrecovered root fragments more than halved the calculated phyllo- and rhizodeposition, indicating that many published estimates are substantially overestimated. The use of CC during autumn provides an important window for C storage with both the input of plant biomass and belowground C investment being drivers of C storage. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Double-cropping rice cultivation reduces soil fertility, and the extensive use of chemical fertilizers has harmful effects on both the environment and grain yield. The application of organic materials could be used as a practical strategy to maintain soil fertility and improve grain yield in a double-season rice cropping system. For this purpose, field experiments with six growing seasons over three years, from 2016 to 2018, were conducted to assess the effects of five organic materials (biochar, Chinese milk vetch, rice straw, rapeseed cake fertilizer, and manure) on the grain yield and soil fertility, aiming to save about 25\% of the chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer required for all rice growing stages. The result showed that, compared with CK (the most common dose of fertilizer in this study region; 100\% chemical fertilizer without organic fertilizer), the grain yield and soil fertility of double-cropped rice were increased after applying organic fertilizers for three consecutive years. Specifically, the CRC treatment (Chinese milk vetch (10.77 t haâˆ’1 in fresh)/rice straw (26.51 t haâˆ’1 in fresh) + 75\% chemical fertilizer) showed significantly higher rates of effective panicles (4.65â€“10.92\%) and annual grain yield (8.00â€“8.82\%). The total N, total phosphorus (P), total potassium (K), alkaline N, and available P content in the CRC soil were significantly increased by 11.85\%, 12.22\%, 15.08\%, 23.32\%, and 41.04\%, respectively, relative to CK. The decomposition of the applied Chinese milk vetch and rice straw combined with 75\% chemical fertilizer resulted in more soil humus (9.50 g kgâˆ’1), humic acid (3.19 g kgâˆ’1), fulvic acid (3.26 g kgâˆ’1), and active organic carbon (5.78 g kgâˆ’1) and a significantly higher carbon pool management index (13.5\%), as well as significantly higher soil urease activity (18.10\%) and acid phosphatase activity (17.64\%). Therefore, in this study, Chinese milk vetch (10.77 t haâˆ’1 in fresh) in the early rice season/rice straw (26.51 t haâˆ’1 fresh) in the late rice season + 75\% chemical fertilizer treatment was the optimal dose for the double-season rice cropping system. It resulted in higher rice yields and has the potential to be used for more sustainable soil fertility. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Understanding system innovation adoption: {A} comparative analysis of integrated soil fertility management uptake in {Tamale} ({Ghana}) and {Kakamega} ({Kenya
VL  - 34
SN  - NA
AB  - Sustainable intensification of African farming systems has been high on the agenda of research and development programs for decades. System innovations such as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and conservation agriculture have been proposed to tackle the complex challenges farmers face. In this study, we assess how different factors at the plot, farm and institutional level can influence the adoption of ISFM. We employed a stratified sampling approach to randomly select 285 and 300 farmers in Tamale, northern Ghana and Kakamega County, western Kenya, respectively. These two locations were selected to understand the underlying reasons for their divergent adoption levels. Ordinal regression models were used to identify determinants of adoption. In Tamale, adoption rates of ISFM are much lower than in Kakamega. Only 3\% of the farmers fully adopted the recommended practices compared with 36\% in Kakamega. The low availability of improved seeds is a major reason for the lower uptake of the complete ISFM paradigm in Tamale. The econometric analysis revealed that plot level variables such as soil carbon, soil texture, slope and plot area had a significant effect on the number of adopted ISFM components at both locations. Moreover, family labor availability is also an important factor. Other farm and household characteristics, such as off-farm occupation, livestock ownership, and membership in associations, matter for Kakamega only. Key policy recommendations include promotion of locally available organic resources and improved access to improved seeds in Tamale. Â© 2017 Cambridge University Press.

VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - Regional-scale precise soil moisture measurements are required for remote sensing-based soil moisture product validation besides, complimenting in several hydrological and agricultural applications. Though the gravimetric method provides the most accurate soil moisture measurements, it cannot be extended to the regional-scale due to the large number of sampling requirements. An impedance probe is a suitable substitute for the time-intensive gravimetric method; however, it needs soil/field-specific calibrations for precise measurements. The present study aims to develop a generalized calibration of an impedance probe (i.e., ThetaProbe) for precise measurements of soil moisture at the regional-scale within the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.04 m3 m-3 to fulfil the accuracy requirement of current satellite missions. A few methods for calibrating impedance probe were investigated using 496 gravimetric samples and coincident impedance probe measurements collected over 83 locations through field campaigns in a paddy dominated tropical Indian watershed that covers an area of 500 km2. The manufacturer generalized calibration was found to have high RMSE (0.0523 m3 m-3) and considerable bias (0.0241 m3 m-3) in soil moisture measurements. Developed generalized and soil-specific calibration based on a linear regression technique that resulted in RMSE values of 0.0468 and 0.0422 m3 m-3, respectively. Further, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) based method, a nonlinear technique, was used for developing a generalized calibration of the impedance probe. The results illustrated that BNN-based generalized calibration (RMSE{\textless}0.04 m3 m-3) performs better than the linear regression-based calibrations (RMSE{\textgreater}0.04 m3 m-3). Moreover, the performance of BNN-based generalized calibration was further improved by the inclusion of soil physical properties as input and yielded an RMSE value up to 0.0352 and 0.0366 m3 m-3 during training and cross-validation process, respectively.

AB  - The major issue in modern agriculture is long-term sustainability. Nutrient management by integrating organic manures and inorganic fertilizers may play a vital role in improving and sustaining crop productivity. A long-term field experiment (since 1984) comprising 11 treatments with different combinations of inorganic and organic fertilizers such as farm yard manure (FYM), wheat cut straw (WCS) and Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata L.) as green manure (GM) was conducted to evaluate their effects on crop yield, nutrient accumulation and soil fertility status under a riceâ€“wheat cropping system. The maximum grain yield of wheat was recorded in T6, i.e. 50\% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) + 50\% nitrogen through FYM in rice and 100\% RDF in wheat (4291 kg haâˆ’1) as compared to chemically fertilized plots T5, i.e. 100\% RDF in both rice and wheat (3441 kg haâˆ’1). The application of organic manures in combination with chemical fertilizers reduced soil pH and bulk density from 7.40 to 7.23 and 1.49 to 1.37 g cmâˆ’3, respectively. Soil organic carbon (SOC), available soil nutrients and nutrient accumulation by crop were higher in integrated nutrient management-treated plots as compared to control. A positive and significant correlation was observed between SOC and available soil nitrogen (r = 0.987), phosphorus (r = 0.913) and potassium (r = 0.921). The results clearly suggest that integrated use of chemical fertilizers and organic manures on a long-term basis improves soil fertility and crop productivity with the potential to enhance soil sustainability.

VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - An effective evaluation of soil fertility can provide a theoretical basis for managing quality and strategies of fertilization for soil. Based on 32 m Ã— 32 m grid sampling, the soil organic matter, total N, total P, total K, available K, available P, salinity and soil pH were used as the soil fertility evaluation factors. And we integrated evaluation of the soil fertility using classical statistics, geostatistics and modified Nemoro fertility index. The result shows that the mean value of pH was 8.89 which showed alkalinity. The CV for organic matter, total N, total K, pH and available K were low variation. Others (total P, available P and salinity) were moderate variation. The nugget variances for organic matter and total were strong spatial autocorrelation. Others were between 0.418 and 0.5, indicating moderate spatial autocorrelation. The spatial distribution of each fertility index was not obvious. The Ps was within the range of 0.63â€“0.80, all fertility indicators surrounding graphics areas were small in Radar map, indicating the fertility level was classified as barren. The mean fertility index, Pi, of the soil was in the order: available K {\textgreater} salinity {\textgreater} total K {\textgreater} available P {\textgreater} pH {\textgreater} total P {\textgreater} organic matter {\textgreater} total N. The soil organic matter and total N were the main limiting factors restraining soil fertility. The spatial distribution patterns of soil index and Ps were complicated and had no regularity with patch distribution at field scale. The methods of increasing organic fertilizers, crop rotation and fallow were practicable and necessary for soil fertilizing management, increasing yields and improving crop quality.

AB  - To understand surface biogeophysical processes, accurately evaluating the geographical and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture is crucial. It is well known that the surface soil moisture content (SMC) affects soil reflectance at all solar spectrum wavelengths. Therefore, future satellite missions, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, will be essential for mapping and monitoring global soil moisture changes. Our study compares two widely used moisture retrieval models: the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance (MARMIT) and the soil water parametric (SWAP)-Hapke model. We evaluated the SMC retrieval accuracy of these models using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) hyperspectral imagery and goniometer hyperspectral data. Laboratory analysis employed hyperspectral goniometer data of sediment samples from four locations reflecting diverse environments, while field validation used hyperspectral UAS imaging and coordinated ground truth collected in 2018 and 2019 from a barrier island beach at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site. The (SWAP)-Hapke model achieves comparable accuracy to MARMIT using laboratory hyperspectral data but is less accurate when applied to UAS hyperspectral imagery than the MARMIT model. We proposed a modified version of the (SWAP)-Hapke model, which achieves better results than MARMIT when applied to laboratory spectral measurements; however, MARMIT's performance is still more accurate when applied to UAS imagery. These results are likely due to differences in the models' descriptions of multiply-scattered light and MARMIT's more detailed description of air-water interactions. Â© 2023. The Authors.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of in situ and remote sensing soil moisture data assimilation in the {APSIM} model for improving agricultural forecasting across the {US} {Midwest
VL  - 27
SN  - NA
AB  - Today, the most popular approaches in agricultural forecasting leverage process-based crop models, crop monitoring data, and/or remote sensing imagery. Individually, each of these tools has its own unique advantages but is, nonetheless, limited in prediction accuracy, precision, or both. In this study we integrate in situ and remote sensing (RS) soil moisture observations with APSIM model through sequential data assimilation to evaluate the improvement in model predictions of downstream state variables across five experimental sites in the US Midwest. Four RS data products and in situ observations spanning 19 site years were used through two data assimilation approaches, namely ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and generalized ensemble filter (GEF), to constrain model states at observed time steps and estimate joint background and observation error matrices. Then, the assimilation's impact on estimates of soil moisture, yield, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), tile drainage, and nitrate leaching was assessed across all site years. When assimilating in situ observations, the accuracy of soil moisture forecasts in the assimilation layers was improved by reducing RMSE by an average of 17 \% for 10 cm and âˆ¼28 \% for 20 cm depth soil layer across all site years. These changes also led to improved simulation of soil moisture in deeper soil layers by an average of 12 \%. Although crop yield was improved by an average of 23 \%, the greatest improvement in yield accuracy was demonstrated in site years with higher water stress, where assimilation served to increase available soil water for crop uptake. Alternatively, estimates of annual tile drainage and nitrate leaching were not well constrained across the study sites. Trends in drainage constraint suggest the importance of including additional data constraint such as evapotranspiration. The assimilation of RS soil moisture showed a weaker constraint of downstream model state variables when compared to the assimilation of in situ soil moisture. The median reduction in soil moisture RMSE for observed soil layers was lower, on average, by a factor of 5. However, crop yield estimates were still improved overall with a median RMSE reduction of 17.2 \%. Crop yield prediction was improved when assimilating both in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations, and there is strong evidence that yield improvement was higher when under water-stressed conditions. Comparisons of system performance across different combinations of remote sensing data products indicated the importance of high temporal resolution and accurate observation uncertainty estimates when assimilating surface soil moisture observations.

VL  - 16
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - The topography can be very important for passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture due to its complex influence on the emitted brightness temperature observed by a satellite microwave radiometer. In this study, a methodology of using the first brightness Stokes parameter (i.e., the sum of vertical and horizontal polarization brightness temperature) observed by the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) was proposed to improve the soil moisture retrieval under complex topographic conditions. The applicability of the proposed method is validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected at four networks (Pali, Naqu, Maqu, and Wudaoliang) on the Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan Plateau. The results over Pali, which is a typical mountainous area, showed that soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are in better agreement with the in-situ measurements (the correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.75 and unbiased root mean square error {\textless}0.04 m3/m3) compared with that using the single-polarization brightness temperature. At the other three networks with relatively flatter terrains, soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are found to be comparable to the single-polarization retrievals. On the contrary, the maximum bias of the retrieved soil moisture caused by topographic effects exceeds 0.1 m3/m3 when using vertical or horizontal polarization alone, which is far beyond the expected accuracy (0.04 m3/m3) of SMOS satellite. In the regions on the Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan Plateau where the vegetation effect can be ignored, soil moisture retrieved using horizontal polarization brightness temperature is generally underestimated, overestimated when using vertical polarization brightness temperature. It is reasonable due to the polarization rotation effect (depolarization) caused by the topographic effects. It is concluded that the proposed method for soil moisture retrieval using the first brightness Stokes parameter has a great potential in reducing the influence of topographic effects.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Integrated ecological farming combines rice growing with aquaculture, and is an effective way to improve soil productivity by increasing soil nutrient supply. However, the long-term effects of such integrated farming on phosphorus fractions and phosphorus availability of paddy soils in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) remain unknown. A four-year field experiment compared the phosphorus fractions with paddy field in rice-fish-duck system (RFD), rice-vegetable cropping system (RVS) and conventional rice system (CRS) in the PRD. SOC and phosphorus fractions were significantly influenced by cropping systems. RFD significantly increased SOC and phosphorus in the soil. Soil phosphorus was dominated by moderately labile P (40.67â€“49.41\%). RFD also significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass phosphorus, and acid phosphatase activity (ACP) by 67.68, 46.68, and 15.87\% compared to RVS, and by 134.14, 65.99, and 30.20\% compared to CRS, respectively. SOC and ACP were the primary factors influencing the conversion and effectiveness of soil phosphorus. The RFD can alleviate low phosphorus activity in PRD paddy soils through the combined effect of chemical and biological process, while promoting a sustainable soil nutrient cycle within the ecosystem and guiding the sustainable development of rational soil fertilization in the PRD.

VL  - 424
SN  - NA
AB  - Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation influences soil nutrient cycling and the functioning of soil microorganisms. However, the effects of AWD on organic nitrogen (ON) partitioning in rice-microbe ecosystems and soil microbial communities are poorly understood. A root-box microcosm experiment with two rice varieties (Nipponbare, Nip; Yangdao 6, YD6), two irrigation regimes (conventional flood irrigation (CF); AWD) and three N application levels (zero N, N0; medium N, N1; high N, N2) was performed based on the 13C,15N-labelled glycine and 13C-phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) techniques. Compared to CF, AWD increased soil dissolved oxygen, microbial growth and the enzymes related to N transformation, thus enhancing rice growth and the N utilization index (NUI). Approximately 4.9â€“10.3\% and 7.7â€“13.6\% of the exogenous glycine was directly utilized by Nip and YD6 seedlings, respectively, and its ratio increased with increasing N levels, whereas 4.4â€“11.2\% and 4.6â€“10.3\% were incorporated into soil microbes. It seems that rice has an appreciable capacity to utilize organic N despite fierce competition with soil microbes. The 13C:15N ratio showed that 12.5â€“37.5\% and 11.0â€“41.0\% of the added glycine was taken up intact by soil microorganisms in the rhizospheres of Nip and YD6. At the N1 and N2 levels, AWD increased rice 15N-glycine uptake but decreased microbial 15N-glycine uptake. Rice intact glycine uptake and soil inorganic N contents were positively correlated with rice biomass and NUI, indicating that the enhanced inorganic N under AWD is beneficial for soil ON availability and rice growth. Gram-negative and general bacteria were the dominant competitors with rice for soil ON. AWD increased the contents of gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the ratio of fungi:bacteria in rhizosphere soils. Collectively, AWD creates a good rhizosphere oxygen environment for rice and microbial growth. ON partitioning in the rice-microbe system and the adaptive adjustment of the microbial community play important roles in modulating soil nutrients for optimal rice growth. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Forms and balance of soil potassium from a long-term integrated crop-livestock system in a subtropical {Oxisol
VL  - 207
SN  - NA
AB  - The presence of animal grazing at different intensities in integrated crop livestock systems (ICLS) may affect the forms and the balance of K in the soil, especially after many years. The objective of this study was to evaluate different K forms and their balance for 17 years with ICLS. ICLS experimental area used no-till practices with different grazing intensities of cattle in winter pasture (black oat + annual ryegrass) and soybean production in the summer season. The experiment started in May 2001 at a location with a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol). The treatments consisted of varied grazing intensities: intensive grazing (IG) at 10 cm of pasture height, moderate grazing (MG) at 20 cm of pasture height, and a no grazing (NG) treatment. The experimental design was a randomized block design with three replicates. Soil samples were collected in 2001, 2007, 2012 and 2017 in 0âˆ’5, 5âˆ’10, 10âˆ’15 and 15âˆ’20 cm of soil layers. Desorption of K was measured using the Mehlich-1 method and the results were fitted to first-order kinetic equations to obtain readily and potentially available K content. Total K was determined by X-ray fluorescence, and the unavailable K by the difference between the total K and potentially available K. Long-term no-till ICLS resulted in an increase in more readily available K forms in the soil surface. The increase was especially prominent in the no-grazing treatment due to the greater amount of K left in the plant residues. Regardless of grazing intensity, soybean cultivation was the controlling component of the soil nutrient budget, representing 98.6 \% of the total amount of K exported. Animal outputs represent only 1.4 \% of total K exported and are therefore the recycling component of the system. Although meat production in ICLS represents only a very small fraction of the amount of K exported from the system, K tends to become less available in the grazed treatments in the long-term.

TI  - Effect of soil fertility on the allocation of nitrogen derived from different maize residue parts in the soil-plant system
VL  - 379
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop residue incorporation is an effective agricultural management to enhance soil organic carbon and nitrogen (N) sequestration, which inevitably affects the crop N uptake, and consequently the allocation of N in the soil-plant system. However, to what extent the crop residue type and soil fertility moderate the contribution and recovery of maize (Zea mays. L) residue-derived N (residue-N) in the soil-plant system is poorly understood. Therefore, a 2-year in situ experiment was conducted on an Alfisol with high fertility (HF) and low fertility (LF), along with the application of 15N-labeled maize root or straw (both stem and leaf) residues. The results showed that the HF treatment had a smaller proportion of residue-N in total N uptake compared with the LF treatment (on average of 2.0\% vs. 3.6\%), but with a larger recovery rate (on average of 23.5\% vs. 12.8\%). The application of straw residues increased the proportion of residue-N in plant total N compared with that from the application of root residues in the HF treatment. The percentage of residue-N in total soil N (TSN) and the residue-N recovery in the LF soil were 60.7â€“108.5\% and 9.6â€“25.8\% higher than those in the HF soil, respectively. The proportion of root-derived N (root-N) in TSN was significantly higher than that of straw-derived N (straw-N) in the LF soil. In addition, total residue-N recovery rates were similar among all residue-amended treatments. The results indicated that the soil with high fertility could increase residue-N utilization by plant, especially the straw-N, while the soil with low fertility favored the accumulation of the residue-N in soil, especially the root-N, and its low fertility was more likely to be improved. Overall, soil fertility and residue type could significantly affect the allocation of maize residue-N in the soil-plant system. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of cassava allelochemicals on rubber tree pathogens, soil microorganisms, and soil fertility in a rubber tree-cassava intercropping system
VL  - 23
SN  - 1511-1768
AB  - The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)-cassava (Manihot esculenta) intercropping system is one of the most popular intercropping patterns for small-holder rubber planters. However, this practice is not recommended in some rubber-producing countries, since it is believed that the rubber tree and cassava share some identical pathogens and that the intercropping system will deplete soil fertility. The effects of cassava allelochemicals on rubber tree pathogens have never been reported. Using controlled plate tests, pot tests, and field experiments, this study aimed to assess the possible adverse effects that cassavas may impart to rubber plantations. The results showed: (1) although the leaf extract, decomposed leaf extract and root exudates of cassava inhibited or had no effect on the mycelial growth of the rubber tree pathogenCorynespora cassiicola,10 mg mL(-1)and 100 mg mL(-1)cassava leaf water extracts and testing concentrations of cassava root extraction significantly promoted the mycelial growth of the rubber tree pathogenRigidoporus lignosus, which increased the risk of rubber tree white root disease; (2) the overall soil fertility was increased significantly in the rubber tree-cassava intercropping system. However, the soil phosphorus content was reduced significantly in the field experiment; (3) the average girth of rubber trees was significantly reduced, and the girth uniformity was decreased in the intercropping system. Based on the experiment results, we suggested that an optimised fertiliser recommendation, particularly on the phosphorus amount, should be developed and implemented for the rubber tree-cassava intercropping system. In addition, since the intercropping of cassava will increase the risk ofR. lignosus-induced rubber tree white root disease, which is very hard to prevent and eradicate once rubber trees are infected, the intercropping of cassava in rubber plantation rows should not be recommended in theR. lignosusprevailing areas.

TI  - Trees and herbaceous vegetation strips both contribute to changes in soil fertility and soil organism communities in an agroforestry system
VL  - 463
SN  - NA
AB  - Purpose: Alley cropping systems introduce herbaceous strips planted with trees into cropped fields. While such systems may have a positive effect on soil fertility, the respective roles of the trees and the herbaceous vegetation in shaping this effect remain unclear. We investigated the effect of the distance from herbaceous strips with or without walnut trees on soil fertility and earthworm communities in a 20 year old Mediterranean plot intercropped with tomatoes. Methods: We determined the effects of i) the presence of trees, ii) the distance from the herbaceous strip (0 m, 1 m and 2.5 m) and iii) the distance from the tree on microbial biomass and respiration, earthworm density and soil C, N and P contents in the 0â€“25 cm layer at three sampling seasons. Results: Herbaceous strips presented a higher microbial biomass C related to soil organic carbon, a lower microbial metabolic quotient, and a higher density of earthworms than the crop alley regardless of tree presence. Soil organic carbon content increased in the presence of trees. Available P and microbial biomass increased at 1 m from the tree in the HS. Earthworm density and microbial biomass were higher at 1 m than at 2.5 m from the HS. Conclusions: Herbaceous strips were an effective shelter for earthworms and fostered a high and efficient microbial biomass throughout the year, with or without trees, probably due to diversified vegetation and no soil disturbance. The mechanisms by which these changes could impact the crop alley remain to be studied. Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Impact of controlled-release urea on rice yield, nitrogen use efficiency and soil fertility in a single rice cropping system.
VL  - 10
SN  - 2045-2322
AB  - Overuse of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has led to low N use efficiency (NUE) and high N loss in single rice cropping systems in southeast China. Application of  controlled-release urea (CRU) is considered as an effective N fertilizer practice  for improving crop yields and NUE. Here, field experiments were conducted during  2015-2017 to assess the effects of two CRUs (resin-coated urea (RCU) and  polyurethane-coated urea (PCU)) on rice yields, NUE and soil fertility at two  sites (Lincheng town (LC) and Xintang town (XT)). Four treatments were  established at each site: (1) control with no N application (CK), (2) split  application of conventional urea (U, 270â€‰kgâ€‰N ha(-1)), (3) single basal  application of RCU (RCU, 216â€‰kgâ€‰N ha(-1)), and (4) single basal application of  PCU (PCU, 216â€‰kgâ€‰N ha(-1)). The N application rate in the CRU treatment compared  to the U treatment was reduced by 20\%. However, the results showed that, compared  to split application of urea, single basal application of CRU led to similar rice  grain yields and aboveground biomass at both sites. No significant difference in  the N uptake by rice plant was observed between the U and CRU treatments at  either site. There were no significant differences in the N apparent recovery  efficiency (NARE) among the U, RCU and PCU treatments, with the exception of that  in XT in 2015. Compared to application of U, application of CRU increased the N  agronomic efficiency (NAE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP) by 17.4-52.6\%  and 23.4-29.8\% at the LC site, and 15.0-84.1\% and 23.2-33.4\% at the XT site,  respectively, during 2015-2017. Yield component analysis revealed that greater  rice grain yield in response to N fertilizer was attributed mainly to the number  of panicles per m(2), which increased in the fertilized treatments compared to  the CK treatment. The application of CRU did not affect the soil fertility after  rice harvest in 2016. Overall, these results suggest that single basal  application of CRU constitutes a promising alternative N management practice for  reducing N application rates, time- and labor-consuming in rice production in  southeast China.

TI  - Two-step fusion method for generating 1 km seamless multi-layer soil moisture with high accuracy in the {Qinghai}-{Tibet} plateau
VL  - 197
SN  - NA
AB  - Current remote sensing techniques fail to observe and generate large scale multi-layer soil moisture (SM) due to the inherent features of the satellite sensors. The lack of comprehensive understanding of multi-layer SM hinders the sustainable development of agriculture, hydrology, and food security. In order to overcome the depth barrier of traditional SM assimilation and downscaling methods, we developed a Two-step Multi-layer SM Downscaling (TMSMD) framework by fusing multi-source remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data through both machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate multi-layer SM. The produced multi-layer SM was characterized by high resolution (1 km), high spatio-temporal continuity (cloud-free and daily), and high accuracy (i.e., 3H data). Firstly, the coarse resolution SMAP SM was downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution using LightGBM to weaken the effects of scale mismatch issue and provide high-resolution input for the subsequent calibration. Results indicated that the downscaled SMAP SM remained high consistency with the original SMAP SM product. With the high-resolution inputs, we calibrated the downscaled SMAP SM using multi-layer in-situ SM through state-of-the-art attention-based LSTM. Results demonstrated that the average PCC, RMSE, ubRMSE, and MAE were improved by 22.3 \%, 50.7 \%, 26.2 \%, and 56.7 \% compared to SMAP L4 SM while 38.5 \%, 52.1 \%, 29.5 \%, and 58.7 \% compared to downscaled SMAP SM. Further spatio-temporal and comparative analysis confirmed that the multi-layer SM produced by the TMSMD framework had excellent performance in capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics. In conclude, the proposed TMSMD framework successfully generated 3H multi-layer SM data and is promising for accurate assessment and monitoring in agriculture, water resources, and environmental domains.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Water-saving technologies such as drip irrigation and straw mulching are aligned with sustainable agriculture as they enhance soil health, preserve water resources, and improve crop production. Understanding their combined impact, especially in subtropical rice-potato cropping system, is crucial. This study delves into the economic feasibility and impact on soil fertility when adopting drip irrigation and straw mulching. Field experiments demonstrated that using rice straw as mulch significantly increased nutrient availability, with available nitrogen (N) increasing by 15\% to 17\%, available phosphorus (P) by 13\% to 14\%, and available potassium (K) by 31\% to 33\% compared to non-mulched conditions. Furthermore, compared to conventional irrigation, drip irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher soil available N, with increases ranging from 6 to 8\% during the potato tuber initiation stage. Economic analysis showed that despite initial investment costs, adopting drip irrigation with straw mulch resulted in higher net returns. Rice-potato system with drip irrigation and straw mulch had a higher benefitâ€“cost ratio, although it had a slighter shift in payback period than conventional practice. The research highlights sustainable intensification in rice-potato systems, suggesting strategic techniques for productivity and resource conservation to farmers and stakeholders.

TI  - Incorporation of manure into ridge and furrow planting system boosts yields of maize by optimizing soil moisture and improving photosynthesis
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - A sustainable management strategy of soil fertility and cropping system is critical to guaranteeing food security. However, little is known about the effects of soil amendment strategies on crop growth via regulating soil moisture and photosynthesis in a ridge and furrow cropping system. Here, field experiments were carried out in 2017 and 2018 in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China to investigate the effects of integrated use of ridge and furrow planting and manure amendment on grain yields of maize. Four treatments were designed: CK (flat planting with 100\% chemical fertilizer), RFC (ridge and furrow planting with 100\% chemical fertilizer), RFR (ridge and furrow planting with 100\% control-released fertilizer), and RFM (ridge and furrow planting with 50\% manure fertilizer + 50\% N fertilizer). On average, RFM increased photosynthetic rates (Pn) by 74\%, followed by RFR by 47\%, and RFC by 26\%, compared to CK. Also, stomatal conductance (Cd), transpiration rates (Tr), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were highest with RFM, followed by RFR and RFC. Averaged across the two years, RFM conserved 10\% more soil water storage (SWS) than CK did at harvest, followed by RFR with an increment by 8\%. However, RFC consumed more soil water than CK did, with its ETc 8\% higher than CK. Consequently, spring maize treated with RFM suffered less drought stress, especially in 2017 when precipitation was insufficient. On average, grain yields and water use efficiency of RFM were increased by 18\% and 27\%, compared to CK. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that there existed significant positive correlation between SWS in top layers and grain yields, while SWS in deep layers had negative effects on grain yields. In conclusion, the incorporation of manure into ridge and furrow planting system can be an efficient agronomic practice to improve plant photosynthesis, optimize soil moisture, and boost grain yields in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China.

AB  - This review provides a detailed synthesis of various in-situ, remote sensing, and machine learning approaches to estimate soil moisture. Bibliometric analysis of the published literature on soil moisture shows that Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is the most widely used in-situ instrument, while remote sensing is the most preferred application, and random forest is the widely applied algorithm to simulate surface soil moisture. We have applied ten most widely used machine learning models on a publicly available dataset (in-situ soil moisture measurement and satellite images) to predict soil moisture and compared their results. We have briefly discussed the potential of using the upcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission images to estimate soil moisture. Finally, this review discusses the capabilities of physics-informed and automated machine learning (AutoML) models to predict the surface soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This review will assist researchers in investigating the applications of soil moisture in the broad domain of earth sciences. Â© 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Optimization of the number and locations of the calibration stations needed to monitor soil moisture using distributed temperature sensing systems: {A} proof-of-concept study
VL  - 620
SN  - NA
AB  - The single-probe heat-pulse (SPHP) technique combined with the Fiber-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology can offer novel high-resolution measurements of soil moisture (Î¸) over spatial scales ranging from several centimeters to several kilometers. However, the key limitation of this method is in obtaining the calibration relationship between Î¸ and soil thermal conductivity (Î») across a specific field. In a previous study, a new methodology using a Gaussian processes model was presented to account for the spatial variability in the Î»-Î¸ relationship. The model aggregated Î¸ measurements from soil moisture sensors scattered over the SPHP transect with the corresponding DTS Î» measurements at their locations. In this study, a novel methodology is tested to optimize the number and locations of soil moisture sensors required to account for the spatial variability of the Î»-Î¸ relationship to achieve higher accuracy from the SPHP technique. The proposed methodology utilizes hierarchical clustering to analyze the information contained in the spatial structure of the SPHP measurements as the soil dries from a nearly-saturated condition. The proposed methodology was tested using data from a field in Oklahoma. Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to validate the performance of the proposed methodology. The predictions obtained from the proposed methodology resulted in Î¸ measurements accuracy comparable to those obtained from the 10\% best Monte-Carlo iterations of randomly assigned soil moisture locations. This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology is more efficient than the traditional practice of randomly spreading calibration soil moisture sensors along the SPHP transect.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, âˆ’0.001, and 0.041 (Formula presented.), respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13\%, 7\%, 22\%, and 18\%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.

AB  - The soil water content (SWC) is a critical factor in agricultural production. To achieve real-time and nondestructive monitoring of the SWC, an experiment was conducted to measure the hyperspectral reflectance of soil samples with varying levels of water content. The soil samples were divided into two parts, SWC higher than field capacity (super-Î¸f) and SWC lower than field capacity (sub-Î¸f), and the outliers were detected by Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV). The raw spectra were processed using Savitzkyâ€“Golay (SG) smoothing and then the spectral feature variable of SWC was extracted by using a combination of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and random frog (Rfrog). Based on the extracted feature variables, an extreme learning machine (ELM), a back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and a support vector machine (SVM) were used to establish the prediction model. The results showed that the accuracy of retrieving the SWC using the same model was poor, under two conditions, i.e., SWC above and below Î¸f, mainly due to the influence of the lower accuracy of the super-Î¸f part. The number of feature variables extracted by the sub-Î¸f and super-Î¸f datasets were 25 and 18, respectively, accounting for 1.85\% and 1.33\% of the raw spectra, and the variables were widely distributed in the NIR range. Among the models, the best results were achieved by the BPANN model for both the sub-Î¸f and the super-Î¸f datasets; the R2p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the sub-Î¸f samples were 0.941, 1.570\%, and 6.685\%, respectively. The R2p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the super-Î¸f samples were 0.764, 1.479\%, and 4.205\%, respectively. This study demonstrates that the CARSâ€“Rfrogâ€“BPANN method was reliable for the prediction of SWC.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze farmersâ€™ perceptions of maize production constraints and determine the effects of pushâ€“pull technology (PPT) on crop yield, pest control, and improving soil fertility status. Increasing fertilizer prices and pesticide prices, FAWs (fall armyworms) and stemborers, declining soil fertility, and drought are the main maize production constraints in the area. Seventy percent of the respondents indicated that an increase in input prices such as those of fertilizer and seeds is the major constraint in the area, while FAWs (55\%) and stemborers (44.3\%) were ranked the third and fourth major constraints. About 67\% of farmers reported that stemborer damage to maize in PPT plots was either minimal or non-existent. Fifty-five percent of farmers stated that the damage caused to maize by FAWs was low or that there was no damage in PPT plots. PPT reduced stem borer infestation from 83\% to 44\%. The yield gained from PPT plots ranged from 18\% to 31\%. Soil samples taken from PPT plots showed improved soil organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM), the average water content of surface soil (up to 5 cm depth), plays a key role in the energy exchange within the ecosystem. We estimated SSM in areas with vegetation cover (grassland) by combining microwave and optical satellite measurements in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP) in 2015. We exploited TERRA moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations to estimate SSM through a simplified water-cloud model (sWCM). This model considers the impact of vegetation water content (VWC) to SSM retrieval by integrating the vegetation index (VI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), or the normalized difference infrared index (NDII). Sentinel-1 SAR C-band backscattering coefficients, incidence angle, and NDWI/NDII were assimilated in the sWCM to monitor SSM. The soil moisture and temperature monitoring network on the central TP (CTP-SMTMN) measures SSM within the study area, and ground measurements were applied to train and validate the model. Via the proposed methods, we estimated the SSM in vegetated area with an R-2 of 0.43 and a ubRMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when integrating the NDWI and with an R-2 of 0.45 and a ubRMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when integrating the NDII.

TI  - Soil moisture observation in a forested headwater catchment: combining a dense cosmic-ray neutron sensor network with roving and hydrogravimetry at the {TERENO} site {Wustebach
VL  - 14
SN  - 1866-3508
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an effective method to measure soil moisture at a horizontal scale of hundreds of metres and a depth of decimetres. Recent studies proposed operating CRNS in a network with overlapping footprints in order to cover root-zone water dynamics at the small catchment scale and, at the same time, to represent spatial heterogeneity. In a joint field campaign from September to November 2020 (JFC-2020), five German research institutions deployed 15 CRNS sensors in the 0.4 km(2) Wustebach catchment (Eifel mountains, Germany). The catchment is dominantly forested (but includes a substantial fraction of open vegetation) and features a topographically distinct catchment boundary. In addition to the dense CRNS coverage, the campaign featured a unique combination of additional instruments and techniques: hydro-gravimetry (to detect water storage dynamics also below the root zone); ground-based and, for the first time, airborne CRNS roving; an extensive wireless soil sensor network, supplemented by manual measurements; and six weighable lysimeters. Together with comprehensive data from the long-term local research infrastructure, the published data set (available at https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.756ca0485800474e9dc7f5949c63b872; Heistermann et al., 2022) will be a valuable asset in various research contexts: to advance the retrieval of landscape water storage from CRNS, wireless soil sensor networks, or hydrogravimetry; to identify scale-specific combinations of sensors and methods to represent soil moisture variability; to improve the understanding and simulation of land-atmosphere exchange as well as hydrological and hydrogeological processes at the hillslope and the catchment scale; and to support the retrieval of soil water content from airborne and spaceborne remote sensing platforms.

TI  - Partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer improves soil fertility and crop yields while mitigating {N2O} emissions in wheat-maize rotation system
VL  - 154
SN  - NA
AB  - Excessive synthetic N fertilization has resulted in severe soil degradation and high greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems. As a promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15\%, 30\%, 45\%, and 100\% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly reduced by 16.2â€“20.5\%, 28.9â€“33.9\%, 33.2â€“42.2\%, and 70.2â€“74.9\% in two years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3- and NH4+ contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO increased the annual yield by 9.7\% and 37.6\% compared with SF and OF in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45\% organic substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems.

TI  - Sensitive feature evaluation for soil moisture retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing data with few in-situ measurements: {A} case study of the continental {U}.{S
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role for understanding Earthâ€™s land and near-surface atmosphere interactions. Existing studies rarely considered using multi-source data and their sensitiveness to SM retrieval with few in-situ measurements. To solve this issue, we designed a SM retrieval method (Multi-MDA-RF) using random forest (RF) based on 29 features derived from passive microwave remote sensing data, optical remote sensing data, land surface models (LSMs), and other auxiliary data. To evaluate the importance of different features to SM retrieval, we first compared 10 filter or embedded type feature selection methods with sequential forward selection (SFS). Then, RF was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between the in-situ SM measurements from sparse network stations and the optimal feature subset. The experiments were conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS) using in-situ measurements during August 2015, with only 5225 training samples covering the selected feature subset. The experimental results show that mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is better than other feature selection methods, and Multi-MDA-RF outperforms the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), with the R and unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values being 0.93 and 0.032 cm3/cm3, respectively. In comparison with other SM products, Multi-MDA-RF is more accurate and can well capture the SM spatial dynamics. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation using {Bayesian} {Maximum} {Entropy} algorithm from {FY3}-{B}, {MODIS} and {ASTER} {GDEM} remote-sensing data in a maize region of {HeBei} province, {China
VL  - 41
SN  - 0143-1161
AB  - The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) algorithm that can model larger-scale spatial heterogeneity and integrate multiple types of data is a better spatial estimation algorithm in avoiding the circular problem and improving the estimation accuracy of parameters than original empirical geostatistic and spatial statistic methods. To obtain higher-resolution and higher-accuracy soil moisture (SM) data, this study used the BME algorithm to integrate the multiple environmental factor variables related to SM as auxiliary data (11 data sets in total) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Albedo products with 1 kilometre (km) grid resolution from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) satellite data, and the Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, Relief amplitude products generated from ASTER GDEM data. First, the FengYun 3-B satellite (FY3-B) SM product with 25 km grid resolution was downscaled to 1 km grid resolution using the visible, infrared (IR), and microwave fusion method. The downscaled FY3-B SM data and auxiliary data were used to generate the weighted probability soft data (SD) under four cases, case 1: 500 sample points of SD, case 2: 450 sample points of SD, case 3: 400 sample points of SD, and case 4: 350 sample points of SD. Particularly, we used two methods, the multivariable correlation analysis method and principal component analysis (PCA) method to get the weight values of environmental factor variables, i.e. NDVI, LST, Albedo, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, and Relief amplitude with SM. Then, thein-situSM measurements as hard data (HD) were used to calibrate the weighted probability SD in the procedure of BME SM estimation. The SM under four cases were estimated from the weighted probability SD and HD using BME algorithm. Finally, comparisons of the estimated SM using BME algorithm within-situSM measurements at maize study area were carried out in this study. Our results indicated that the accuracy of the estimated SM using BME algorithm, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.049 cm(3) cm(-3), the correlation coefficient (r) = 0.639, the unbiased RMSE (RMSEu) = 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3), and Bias = 0.002 cm(3) cm(-3), under case 1 based on PCA method was obviously better than the downscaled FY3-B SM (RMSE = 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3),r= 0.096, RMSEu = 0.069 cm(3)cm(-3), and Bias = 0.039 cm(3)cm(-3)) that was generated by the visible, IR, and microwave fusion method. We concluded that integrating auxiliary data into SM estimation using BME algorithm could further improve the downscaled FY3-B SM that was generated by visible, IR, and microwave fusion method.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Intensive cultivation of â€˜uala (sweet potato) in the Leeward Kohala field system on Hawaiâ€™i Island supported substantial populations of Native Hawaiians prior to its abandonment in the 19th century. Productivity is influenced by the heterogeneity of the climate and biogeochemical soil characteristics across the substantial ecological gradient. Agricultural infrastructure and associated practices were developed to manage crop production eventuating from the variation in inter-and intra-annual rainfall. Mechanisms of sustaining soil nitrogen (N) are still unclear; however, a pronounced source of N is soil organic matter decomposition. This study investigated in situ the effects of indigenous Hawaiian mulching practices against two control treatments on soil moisture and temperature dynamics to facilitate N mineralization in soil mounds cultivated with â€˜uala. Field experiments were set in two agricultural restoration plots with distinct climatic and soil characteristics. Data included soil moisture and temperature, soil and plant N, growth and development of â€˜uala, and real-time weather data. Concurrently, N mineralization was also investigated under controlled conditions. All indigenous mulching treatments were found to significantly increase soil moisture, regulate temperature variation, and improve N availability compared to control. Differences in soil properties between treatments translated to significant differences in above-ground biomass. The data suggest that these differences would extend to tuber production, but the use of a long-gestation variety limited tuber production in the study. Increased temperatures in the controlled experiments were observed to increase inorganic N significantly, but less substantially than soil moisture. Indigenous practices in the region could have greatly mitigated plant stress due to moisture, temperature, and N availability, increasing productivity and reducing the variability of the Leeward Kohala Field System.

AB  - Forage grasses used in cropping no-till systems in tropical regions alter soil chemical properties, but their long-term impact on soil microbial processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle and microbial community abundance, composition and structure are unknown. Here, microbial functions related to nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification as well as bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations were evaluated in a long-term field experiment in which tropical forage grasses palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster) and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Crins) were cultivated with or without N fertilization. Uncultivated soil was used as a control. Forage grasses, especially palisade grass, increased soil bacterial and fungal abundances, whereas the archaeal population was highest in uncultivated soil. In soils cultivated with forage grasses, N fertilization favored N-cycle-related genes; however, cultivation of palisade grass increased the abundances of amoA bacteria (AOB) and amoA archaea (AOA) genes associated with soil nitrification and decreased the abundances of genes nirS, nirK and nosZ genes related to denitrification, compared to ruzigrass and control, regardless of N input. In addition, abundances of total bacteria and total fungi were associated with the N cycle and plant biomass in soils cultivated with forage grasses. Forage cultivation clearly benefitted the soil nutrient environment (S-SO42-, Mg2+, total-C and -N, N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and microbiome (bacteria and fungi) compared with uncultivated soil. In soil cultivated with palisade grass, the microbial community composition was unresponsive to N addition. The high N uptake by palisade grass supports the competitive advantage of this plant species over microorganisms for N sources. Our results suggest that palisade grass has advantages over ruzigrass for use in agriculture systems, regardless of N input. Â© 2021

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - A method of soil moisture and organic matter content detection based on hyperspectral technology is proposed. A total of 800 different soil samples and hyperspectral data were collected in the laboratory and from the field. A hyperspectral database was established. After wavelet denoising and principal component analysis (PCA) preprocessing, the convolutional neural network (CNN) module was first used to extract the wavelength features of the data. Then, the long- and short-memory neural network (LSTM) module was used to extract the feature bands and nearby hidden state vectors. At the same time, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the hyperparametric weight and bias value of the LSTM training network. At the initial stage, the data were normalized, and all features were analyzed by grey correlation degree to extract important features and to reduce the computational complexity of the data. Then, the GA-optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network (GA-CNN-LSTM) algorithm model proposed in this paper was used to predict soil moisture and organic matter. The prediction performance was compared with CNN, support vector regression (SVR), and CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network model without GA optimization. The GA-CNN-LSTM algorithm was superior to other models in all indicators. The highest accuracy rates of 94.5\% and 92.9\% were obtained for soil moisture and organic matter, respectively. This method can be applied to portable hyperspectrometers and unmanned aerial vehicles to realize large-scale monitoring of moisture and organic matter distribution and to provide a basis for rational irrigation and fertilization in the future.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - In arid and semi-arid sub-tropical regions of India, pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.]â€”wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system is the most important system under irrigated conditions. However, it is very exhaustive cropping system and productivity of pearl millet-wheat system has become constant or marginally declined for the last three decades. The imbalanced use of fertilizers and high intensity farming activities declined the soil nutrient status and also deteriorate physical and biological properties of soil. Therefore, to maintain soil health and productivity, balanced fertilization based on soil testing is very essential. A study of balanced fertilization based on Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) approach was initiated in 2009 at Research Farm, CCSHAU, Hisar, with seven treatments viz. T1â€”control, T2â€”farm yard manure (FYM) @ 15 t haâˆ’1, T3â€”recommended dose of nitrogen and phosphorus (RDN and P), T4â€”STCR with target yield (TY) 3.0 t haâˆ’1, T5â€”STCR with TY 3.5 t haâˆ’1, T6â€”integrated STCR with TY 3.0 t haâˆ’1 + FYM and T7â€”integrated STCR with TY 3.5 t haâˆ’1 + FYM. Integrated treatment (T7) recorded the highest crop grain and straw yield followed by chemical fertilizers alone (T3â€“T5) whereas lowest grain and straw yield was found in control (T1) after 10 cycles of pearl millet-wheat system. Application of FYM along with chemical fertilizers enhanced total N, P and K uptake by approximately 150, 192 and 150\% respectively, over the control. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) and available nutrients were found maximum at early developmental stages and decreased at maturity. The long-term balanced nutrient management using STCR approach has improved soil nutrient status, SOC, pearl millet yield, nutrient uptake and use efficiency of fertilizers.

TI  - Quantification of soil water balance components based on continuous soil moisture measurement and the {Richards} equation in an irrigated agricultural field of a desert oasis
VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - An accurate assessment of soil water balance components (SWBCs) is necessary for improving irrigation strategies in any water-limited environment. However, quantitative information on SWBCs is usually challenging to obtain, because none of the components (i.e., irrigation, drainage, and evapotranspiration) can be easily measured under actual conditions. Soil moisture is a variable that integrates the water balance components of land surface hydrology, and the evolution of soil moisture is assumed to contain the memory of antecedent hydrologic fluxes, and can thus be used to determine SWBCs from a hydrologic balance. A database of soil moisture measurements from six experimental plots with different treatments in the middle Heihe River basin of China was used to test the potential of a such a database for estimating SWBCs. We first compared the hydrophysical properties of the soils in these plots, such as vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and soil water retention features, for supporting SWBC estimations. We then determined evapotranspiration and other SWBCs using a method that combined the soil water balance method and the inverse Richards equation (a model of unsaturated soil water flow based on the Richards equation). To test the accuracy of our estimation, we used both indirect methods (such as power consumption of the pumping irrigation well and published SWBCs values at nearby sites) and the water balance equation technique to verify the estimated SWBCs values, all of which showed good reliability with respect to our estimation method. Finally, the uncertainties of the proposed methods were analyzed to evaluate the systematic error of the SWBC estimation and any restrictions regarding its application. The results showed significant variances among the film-mulched plots in both the cumulative irrigation volumes (652.1-867.3 mm) and deep drainages (170.7-364.7 mm). Moreover, the un-mulched plot had remarkably higher values in both cumulative irrigation volumes (1186.5 mm) and deep drainages (651.8 mm) compared with the mulched plots. Obvious correlation existed between the volume of irrigation and that of drained water. However, the ET demands for all of the plots behaved pretty much the same, with the cumulative ET values ranging between 489.1 and 561.9 mm for the different treatments in 2016, suggesting that the superfluous irrigation amounts had limited influence on the accumulated ET throughout the growing season due to the poor water-holding capacity of the sandy soil. This work confirmed that relatively reasonable estimations of the SWBCs in coarse-textured sandy soils can be derived by using soil moisture measurements; the proposed methods provided a reliable solution over the entire growing season and showed a great potential for identifying appropriate irrigation amounts and frequencies, and thus a move toward sustainable water resources management, even under traditional surface irrigation conditions.

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility and nutrient management strategies in calcareous soils of {Khuzestan} province: a case study using the {Nutrient} {Index} {Value} method
VL  - 196
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility (SF) is a crucial factor that directly impacts the performance and quality of crop production. To investigate the SF status in agricultural lands of winter wheat in Khuzestan province, 811 samples were collected from the soil surface (0â€“25 cm). Eleven soil properties, i.e., electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), available phosphorus (Pav), exchangeable potassium (Kex), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and soil pH, were measured in the samples. The Nutrient Index Value (NIV) was calculated based on wheat nutritional requirements. The results indicated that 100\%, 93\%, and 74\% of the study areas for CCE, pH, and EC fell into the low, moderate, and moderate to high NIV classes, respectively. Also, 25\% of the area is classified as low fertility (NIV {\textless} 1.67), 75\% falls under medium fertility (1.67 {\textless} NIV value {\textless} 2.33), and none in high fertility (NIV value {\textgreater} 2.33). Assessment of the mean wheat yield (AWY) and its comparison with NIV showed that the highest yield was in the Ramhormoz region (5200 kg.haâˆ’1), while the lowest yield was in the Hendijan region (3000 kg.haâˆ’1) with the lowest EC rate in the study area. Elevated levels of salinity and CCE in soils had the most negative impact on irrigated WY, while Pav, TN, and Mn availability showed significant effects on crop production. Therefore, implementing SF management practices is essential for both quantitative and qualitative improvement in irrigated wheat production in Khuzestan province.

TI  - Effects of the application of biochar on soil fertility status, and nutrition and yield of onion grown in a no-tillage system
VL  - 69
SN  - NA
AB  - The study was aimed to evaluate the effect of successive applications of increasing biochar rates along with other mineral fertilizers and poultry manure on onion nutrition and yield. The experiment consisted of 2 (agricultural year) Ã— 11 (treatments) factorial combinations over two cropping years (2017 and 2018). Thus, 11 treatments were tested as follows: C = control; MF = mineral fertilizer; PM = poultry manure; B1+ MF = 1 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+MF; B1+ PM = 1 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+PM; B2+ MF = 2 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+MF; B2+ PM = 2 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+PM; B4+ MF = 4 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+MF; B4+ PM = 4 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+PM; B10+ MF = 10 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+MF; B10+ PM = 10 Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar+PM. The highest onion yield (39.9 Mg haâˆ’1) was obtained in 2017 with the biochar rate of 5.9 Mg haâˆ’1 while an increase of 308 kg haâˆ’1 in onion yield was found for each Mg haâˆ’1 of biochar added to soil in 2018. The use of biochar combined with mineral fertilizers increased onion yield; and the use of biochar combined with poultry manure improved soil fertility status. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Improvement of the â€œ{Triangle} {Method}â€ for {Soil} {Moisture} {Retrieval} {Using} {ECOSTRESS} and {Sentinel}-2: {Results} over a {Heterogeneous} {Agricultural} {Field} in {Northern} {India
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - For the purpose of deriving spatiotemporal estimates of soil moisture, the triangle method is one of the most widely used approaches today utilizing remote sensing data. Generally, those techniques are based on the physical relationships that exist when a satellite-derived land surface temperature (Ts) is plotted against a spectral vegetation index (VI). The present study proposes an improvement in the triangle method in retrieving soil moisture over heterogeneous areas. In particular, it proposes a new approach in robustly identifying the extreme points required for the techniqueâ€™s implementation. Those extreme points are then used in calculating fractional vegetation cover (Fr) and scaled Ts. Furthermore, the study proposes a new approach for calculating the coefficients required to develop the relationships between surface soil moisture (SSM) and Fr/Ts, which is implemented using a model and field data. As a case study, an agricultural field in the Varanasi district in India has been used, on which the triangle method is implemented using ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2 data. The much-improved spatial resolution satellite data of 70 m from ECOSTRESS allowed deriving more vivid results of SSM spatial variability for the study area. Comparisons between field soil moisture calculated using the proposed method returned an RMSE of 0.03 and R2 value of 0.84, which are considered very satisfactory. The methodology proposed herein and the results obtained are of significant value with regards to the triangle method, contributing to ongoing efforts at present examining its use for operational product development at a global scale.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The partial replacement of chemical fertilizer with straw return is considered an effective method for improving the accumulation of organic matter and soil fertility, but the characteristics of soil nitrogen fixation and mineralization in a double-cropped rice paddy system are unclear. Based on a 12-year field experiment, we conducted a waterlogged incubation experiment for 49 days to determine the effect of long-term straw return combined with reducing chemical fertilizer application on the dynamic changes of mineralized soil nitrogen (N) content and mineralized N rate under the treatments, including NPK (chemical fertilizers application with straw removal), SBR (straw burned return), and SR (straw return). Results showed that, compared with SBR and NPK, SR significantly increased available nitrogen by 7.4\% and 16.5\%, respectively, due to the higher ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, as well as the total carbon, available phosphorus, and slowly available potassium, suggesting that it could stock a sufficient nitrogen source. During the incubation period, the amount of N mineralization was relatively higher under SR than under SBR and NPK treatments, especially during the later mineralization time, whereas there was no difference in the N mineralization rate. In addition, SR significantly increased soil cumulative N mineralization and N mineralization potential. However, SBR significantly decreased the soil mineralizable N ratio compared with SR and NPK, which may result in a worsening of the N mineralization potential. The results indicated that long-term straw return combined with reducing chemical fertilizer application could significantly improve the N supply capacity of paddy rice field soil to better coordinate the soil N supply and immobilization.

TI  - Effects of vegetation patterns on soil nitrogen and phosphorus losses on the slope-gully system of the {Loess} {Plateau
VL  - 324
SN  - NA
AB  - The slope-gully system, the erosion unit on the Loess Plateau, suffers from severe soil erosion and loss of soil nutrients. Restoring vegetation can effectively reduce soil erosion, thereby reducing the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus. In the Loess Plateau, owing to the shortage of water resources and the adverse effects of over-revegetation, the restoration of vegetation in large areas is limited. To efficiently prevent the loss of soil nutrients and reduce non-point source pollution, vegetation patterns need to be reasonably restored. However, it is currently not clear as to how this can be achieved. Different slope-gully systems were established in this study, including pattern A (no vegetation), pattern B (up-slope vegetation), pattern C (middle-slope vegetation), and pattern D (down-slope vegetation). Then, the effects of vegetation patterns on soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil total phosphorus (TP) losses associated with runoff and sediment processes was quantitatively evaluated through the simulated rainfall. The results showed that (1) vegetation pattern markedly affected the yields of runoff, sediment, soil nitrogen, and soil phosphorus, resulting in the following order: pattern A {\textgreater} pattern B {\textgreater} pattern C {\textgreater} pattern D. (2) The correlation between TN and runoff was higher than that between TN and sediment; conversely, TP was more strongly correlated with sediment than with runoff. (3) Nitrogen loss with runoff was the main source of TN (58.76â€“90.74\%), while phosphorus loss with sediment was the main source of TP (48.51â€“89.30\%). Compared with other vegetation patterns, the down-slope can more effectively reduce the yields of runoff and sediment, thereby reducing the loss of TN and TP. Therefore, it was suggested that the lower part of the slope should be considered when revegetating. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Cyanobacteria-based soil amendments in the soil-plant system: {Effects} of inoculations on soil nutrient and microbial dynamics under spring wheat growth
VL  - 77
SN  - NA
AB  - Cyanobacteria are promising alternatives to chemical fertilizers for managing nutrients and preserving soil function. In this study, two pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of inoculations with the cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica on an arable Mollisol from the U.S. Upper Midwest and growth of spring wheat. Experiment 1 evaluated surface soil nutrient and microbial dynamics at early stages of wheat development. Experiment 2 evaluated the potential of microalgal inoculations (A. cylindrica and/or Chlamydomonas sp.) to replace urea and measured plant growth and soil parameters at three depths at harvest. Experiment 1 revealed inoculation increased surface soil soluble organic carbon (SolC), microbial biomass carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), mineral N, available phosphorus (P), and microbial activity. At day 42 after sowing, wheat plant N was higher in inoculated than non-inoculated soil, and the nitrate/nitrite level in inoculated soil significantly decreased in the presence of plants. In Experiment 2, inoculation had greater effects on surface soil than deeper soil depths for SolC, microbial biomass C and N, mineral N, and available-P. Grain yield was not statistically different in treatments with 100 \% N from urea, 75 \% N from A. cylindrica plus 25 \% N-urea, and 100 \% N from an algal mixture. Equivalent grain protein was achieved only when 25 \% N from urea was replaced with N from A. cylindrica, highlighting the need for optimizing inoculation timing and plant N uptake. These results support the beneficial role of cyanobacteria-based inoculations for soil quality and plant growth, and as renewable resources for agricultural systems. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - New age challenges of irrational use of fertilizers under monocropping of rice calls for integrative nutrient management strategy along with establishment of rice based cropping system. A field study was carried out in 2017â€“18 and 2018â€“19 at Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, India to investigate the integrated nutrient management strategies on productivity, nutrient indices and soil nutrient status in short grain aromatic rice-green gram cropping system. The experiment was set up in split plot design with six nutrient management strategies in rice were taken in main plot in randomized block design and three nutrient management strategies in green gram were taken as sub plot in split-plot design in sequence. Results revealed that application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% Recommended Dose of Nitrogen (RDN)-FYM to rice followed by 75\% NPK + Rhizobium + Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria to green gram recorded the highest rice equivalent yield and production efficiency in 2017â€“18 and 2018â€“19 followed by 50\% NPK+ 50\% RDN-FYM to rice followed by 100\% NPK to green gram. Application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% RDN-FYM to rice and 75\% NPK + Rhizobium + PSB to green gram recorded the highest partial factor productivity of nitrogen, nitrogen utilization efficiency and nitrogen uptake efficiency in the system. Soil nutrient status of the cropping system improved with balanced application of organic and inorganic sources of nutrients compared to mineral fertilizers only. Thus, supplementing FYM and sesbania as organic manures along with reduced dose of inorganic fertilizers improved sustainability of rice-green gram system along with improving soil fertility.

TI  - Can ridge-furrow with film and straw mulching improve wheat-maize system productivity and maintain soil fertility on the {Loess} {Plateau} of {China
VL  - 246
SN  - NA
AB  - Ridge-furrow mulching patterns are beneficial to improve crop yields and rainwater use efficiency, but it is not clear whether they can improve productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility on the Loess Plateau of China. A three-year (2013â€“2016) field trial was conducted during the rotation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) â€“ maize (Zea mays L.) to investigate the effects of ridge-furrow mulching patterns on soil moisture, soil fertility, grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Four ridge-furrow planting patterns included: (1) white plastic film mulch over the ridge (RW), (2) straw mulch over the furrow (RS), (3) white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow (RWS), and (4) black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow (RBS). Flat planting without mulch was CK. The results showed that RW, RS, RWS, and RBS significantly improved soil water storage and aboveground biomass throughout each winter wheat and summer maize growing season compared with CK. Finally, winter wheat grain yield and WUE in the four mulching treatments markedly increased by 13.0â€“32.9\% and 22.5â€“41.5\% in a wet and cool season, 15.5â€“35.2\% and 19.3â€“41.9\% in a season with normal rainfall and temperatures, and 27.2â€“58.9\% and 15.3â€“33.4\% in a dry and warm season, respectively. Maize grain yield and WUE increased by 12.8â€“35.0\% and 19.5â€“46.2\% in a season with normal rainfall and temperature, 15.0â€“38.5\% and 18.0â€“39.9\% in a dry and cool season, and 17.4â€“50.5\% and 13.0â€“42.5\% in a dry and warm season, respectively. Among the four mulching treatments, RWS and RBS significantly improved the yield and WUE of wheat and maize relative to RW and RS over the three years. After three years, soil total nitrogen content in RWS and RBS was significantly greater than in RS. Besides, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen contents in RWS and RBS were all markedly higher than in RW and RS. Our results indicated that RWS and RBS were a promising agricultural practice that improved crop production and simultaneously maintained soil fertility in a rain-fed semi-arid region of China.

TI  - Rational utilization of {Chinese} milk vetch improves soil fertility, rice production, and fertilizer use efficiency in double-rice cropping system in {East} {China
VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aimed to explore the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) on soil fertility and rice production in double rice cropping systems. A field experiment was conducted including the following six treatments: Ck (no NPK mineral fertilizer and no CMV), CMV0 (NPK mineral fertilizer and no CMV), and CMV1â€“4 (NPK mineral fertilizer and 7500 kg haâˆ’1 CMV, 15,000 kg haâˆ’1 CMV, 22,500 kg haâˆ’1 CMV, 30,000 kg haâˆ’1 CMV) from 2008 to 2018. The results showed that the application of CMV enhanced the organic matter, the total nitrogen, the available phosphorus, pH, and enzyme activities (except for the cellulase) in paddy soils. The organic matter and total nitrogen of CMV3 were increased by 15.99\% and 8.07\% compared with CMV0 and the increase rate of the organic matter and total nitrogen was by an average of 0.413 and 0.029 g kgâˆ’1 per year compared with the initial soil, respectively. The CMV return also improved the enzyme activities (except for the cellulase). Meanwhile, the CMV returned to soil increased dramatically the yields of early rice, late rice, and double rice by 13.46\%-26.23\%, 13.63\%-20.84\%, and 13.55\%-25.76\% compared with CMV0, respectively. The yields of early rice, late rice, and double rice of the CMV3 were highest among all the treatments. The application of CMV improved the agronomic efficiency (AE) and the partial factor productivity (PFP), especially for CMV3. The AE and PFP values of double rice for CMV3 increased by 64.54\% and 25.76\%, respectively. The application of CMV also increased the sustainability index and reduced the coefficient of variation of the rice yields. In addition, there was negative linear relationship between the amount of CMV needed to generate higher yields of double rice and the years of CMV application. In conclusion, CMV addition at 15,000â€“22,500 kg haâˆ’1 combined with mineral fertilizer had beneficial effects on the productivity, the stability of rice yield as well as the fertilizer efficiency in double rice cropping system.

TI  - Productivity of wheat (\textit{{Triticum} aestivum} {L}.) and soil fertility with poplar (\textit{{Populus} deltoides}) agroforestry system in the semi-arid ecosystem of {Haryana}, {India
VL  - 122
SN  - 0011-3891
AB  - The diverse and multi-component nature of traditional agroforestry systems (AFS) provides them a unique edge over monoculture cropping, particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems due to their role in providing several ecosystem services (ES) in addition to their prime role in agricultural production. Appropriate selection of components and their management practices results in reduced competition for resources among the components and maximum capitalization of the interactions. Poplar-based AFS adopted in a big way by farmers in the Indo-Gangetic region of India has improved their economic status due to its high industrial value. The present study discusses the effect Populus deltoides as windbreak on yield of wheat as intercrop and soil nutrient status. We considered winter wheat varieties (WH-1105, WH-542, HD-2967, HD-943 and DPW-621-50) during two consecutive years (2013-15) delimited by a row of poplar trees in the east-west and north-south directions. Whereas effects on crop produce were limited for all wheat varieties with increasing distance from the tree line, considerable yield reductions were found near the tree line (treatments T-1 and T-2) for all the wheat varieties. The highest available soil N (365.2 kg ha(-1)), P (19.7 kg ha(-1)) and K (357.3 kg ha(-1)) were recorded near the tree line at a distance of 2 m. To optimize the provisioning service of poplar windbreak AFS, the cultivation of highly shade-tolerant wheat variety HD-2967 may be advisable over other varieties towards the end of the rotation of mature poplar trees.

TI  - The effects of a combined amendment on growth, cadmium adsorption by five fruit vegetables, and soil fertility in contaminated greenhouse under rotation system
VL  - 285
SN  - NA
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) exposure is related to a multitude of adverse health outcomes because food crops grown on Cd-polluted soil are widely consumed by the public. The present study investigates the different application techniques of a combined amendment (lime + zeolite + biochar + compost, LZBC) for soil Cd immobilization effect on growth performance, Cd uptake by the second season crops, and soil quality in greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) under a rotation system. Five fruit vegetables were cultivated as the second season crop in the same plots which have been used for pakchoi as the first season crop (with or without LZBC application). The results indicated that LZBC with the consecutive application (T3) promoted crops biomass and fruit yield the most, followed by LZBC with the second crop application (T2) and LZBC with the first crop application (T1). LZBC application showed increasing rhizosphere soil pH and improvement in soil fertility of all crops including available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity. LZBC had positive influences on soluble sugar, soluble protein, and vitamin C in edible parts of 5 vegetables. Cd contents in fruit, shoot, and root of eggplant, pimento, cowpea, and tomato except cucumber were reduced by adding LZBC. As for the economic performance, T3 had the highest output/input ratio in general. Overall, these results demonstrated that T3 was dramatically more effective for minimizing health risk, increasing production, and facilitating sustainable utilization of soil under the Cd-contaminated GVP system.

SN  - NA
AB  - Rapid and accurate measurement of high-resolution soil total nitrogen (TN) information can promote variable rate fertilization, protect the environment, and ensure crop yields. Many scholars focus on exploring the rapid TN detection methods and corresponding soil sensors based on spectral technology. However, soil spectra are easily disturbed by many factors, especially soil moisture and particle size. Real-time elimination of the interferences of these factors is necessary to improve the accuracy and efficiency of measuring TN concentration in farmlands. Although, many methods can be used to eliminate soil moisture and particle size effects on the estimation of soil parameters using continuum spectra. However, the discrete NIR spectral band data can be completely different in the band attribution with continuum spectra, that is, it does not have continuity in the sense of spectra. Thus, relevant elimination methods of soil moisture and particle size effects on continuum spectra do not apply to the discrete NIR spectral band data. To solve this problem, in this study, moisture absorption correction index (MACI) and particle size correction index (PSCI) methods were proposed to eliminate the interferences of soil moisture and particle size, respectively. Soil moisture interference was decreased by normalizing the original spectral band data into standard spectral band data, on the basis of the strong soil moisture absorption band at 1450 nm. For the PSCI method, characteristic bands of soil particle size were identified to be 1361 and 1870 nm firstly. Next, normalized index N-p, which calculated wavelengths of 1631 and 1870 nm, was proposed to eliminate soil particle size interference on discrete NIR spectral band data. Finally, a new coupled elimination method of soil moisture and particle size interferences on predicting TN concentration through discrete NIR spectral band data was proposed and evaluated. The six discrete spectral bands (1070, 1130, 1245, 1375, 1550, and 1680 nm) used in the on-the-go detector of TN concentration were selected to verify the new method. Field tests showed that the new coupled method had good effects on eliminating interferences of soil moisture and soil particle size.

AB  - Soil moisture is the crucial carrier of the global hydrologic cycle and the dynamic energy balance regulation process. Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor surface soil moisture content (SMC) accurately for the study of the natural ecological environment. The Hapke model is the most widely used photometric model in soil remote sensing research, but the development of this model is limited by the lack of valid multi-angular data. The main innovations of this paper have two aspects: (1) A novel soil moisture retrieval approach based on the Hapke (SMR-Hapke) model is derived by exploring the relationship between single scattering albedo (SSA) and SMC on the optical bands from 400 to 2400 nm. The performance of the proposed model was verified on a dataset consisting of four different soil samples, and the experimental results indicated that the inverted soil moisture from SMR-Hapke model coincided with the measurement values, with theR(2)being generally more than 0.9 in the solar domain. (2) The SMR-Hapke model has been reduced to a linear form on the SWIR field and a physically-based normalized difference soil moisture indexNDSMIHapke has been proposed. Based on the laboratory-based hyperspectral data, we compared the performance ofNDSMIHapke with other traditional soil moisture indices using linear regression analysis, and the results demonstrate that the proposedNDSMIHapke had a great potential for estimating SMC withR(2)values of 0.88. Finally, high-resolution SMC map was produced by combining the Sentinel-2 MSI data withNDSMIHapke. This study provides a novel extended Hapke model for the estimation of surface soil moisture content.

TI  - Impact of soil salinity, texture and measurement frequency on the relations between soil moisture and 20 {MHz}â€“3 {GHz} dielectric permittivity spectrum for soils of medium texture
VL  - 579
SN  - NA
AB  - Dielectric sensors are a popular choice for soil moisture determination. However, the output of many of these devices, especially those operating at frequencies in the MHz range, can be significantly affected by the influence of soil salinity and texture. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of salinity, texture and measurement frequency on dielectric permittivity â€“ soil moisture calibration curves for ten soils of medium texture in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 3 GHz based on the complex dielectric permittivity spectra measured with the use of a coaxial transmission line cell connected to a vector-network-analyzer. The use of laboratory-measured spectra ensures that at all frequencies dielectric permittivity is measured at the same conditions with no influence of factors such as different sensitivity zone or various installation conditions, as in the case of comparing individual sensors operating at various frequencies. The obtained relations were comparable to the calibration curves of several capacitance/impedance sensors operating at corresponding frequencies. Calibration curves for apparent permittivity, which were obtained with the use of simulations in the time domain based on the measured spectra, were also determined for the tested soils. Even though the tested soils did not include soils with high clay content, the impact of soil texture on the calibration curves was observed. Results confirmed that the influence of soil salinity and texture on dielectric permittivity was the most significant in the lower part of the frequency spectrum, while the smallest impact of these factors was observed at frequencies of several hundred MHz and above.

TI  - Effects of long-term organic and inorganic fertilization on greenhouse gas emissions and soil nutrient stoichiometry in a riceâ€“riceâ€“fallow cropping system
VL  - 357
SN  - NA
AB  - Long-term use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can have a negative impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient stoichiometry in paddy soil. However, production of sufficient crops to meet food and feed demands globally requires the use of fertilizer in crop production. In the present study, we assessed the environmental impacts of five fertilizer treatments in a riceâ€“riceâ€“fallow cropping system: no fertilizer (CK); inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers (NPK); manure (M); inorganic phosphorus and potassium fertilizers with manure (PKM); and inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers with manure (NPKM). Soil parameters were analyzed to examine the relationships between GHG emissions, net ecosystem carbon budgets (NECBs), and soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios. Both the PKM and NPKM treatments increased grain yield and the soil carbonâ€“nitrogen (C:N), carbonâ€“phosphorus (C:P), and nitrogenâ€“phosphorus (N:P) ratios compared to the CK treatment; they also decreased the nitrogenâ€“potassium (N:K) ratio. In the combined fertilization treatments, the fallow season accounted for 9â€“13\% of annual methane (CH4) emissions, whereas early rice accounted for 55â€“62 \% and late rice contributed 38â€“45 \%. Compared to the CK, PKM and NPKM fertilization increased the annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 52â€“73 \% and 103â€“115 \%, respectively, in both the rice and fallow seasons. In early rice, the C:P ratio and GHG intensity (GHGI) were negatively correlated with CH4 and N2O emissions, whereas both yield and CH4 emissions had strong positive associations with global warming potential (GWP). In the late rice season, GHGI was negatively correlated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emissions, and N2O had strong positive associations with GWP. CO2 and N2O emission levels were greater from late rice than from early rice, although CH4 emissions from early rice contributed more to the annual GWP, resulting in higher carbon equivalent emissions but a lower carbon efficiency ratio in early rice output. A Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) optimization analysis suggested that PKM was the best fertilization method to improve yield while minimizing negative environmental impacts, followed in descending order by the NPKM, NPK, and M treatments.

VL  - 13

AB  - Long-term large inputs of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in China have caused serious soil P accumulation, low P use efficiency (PUE) and high risk of P loss. Controlling the amount of P fertilizer applied presents an inevitable choice for improving the PUE. Struvite recycled from agricultural wastewater rich in N and P concentrations are capable of slow nutrient release, improving nutrient uptake and enabling the reuse of nutrients from environmental sources when applied to agricultural land. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of struvite combined with P reduction under a riceâ€“wheat rotation system in eastern China. A total of five treatments were set up, including conventional fertilization (FP), a struvite substitution of 100\% P fertilizer (SP), a 50\% P reduction with struvite substitution (RSP), no application of N fertilizer (N0) and no application of P fertilizer (P0). Grain yield, crop N and P uptake, N and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE) and soil nutrient status were assessed. Under the same P application rate, the yield and aboveground biomass of the SP treatment were slightly higher than those of FP treatment, but the crop P uptake, PUE and soil available P content were significantly increased. The RSP treatment did not reduce yield with 50\% P reduction, and significantly improved the PUE and soil available P content. Crop N uptake and NUE were also found to be increased in SP and RSP treatments with struvite substitution. The P apparent balance showed that both the SP and FP treatments had a P surplus, but the RSP treatment had a P break-even, and the soil available P content remains stable compared with the initial value. The results indicate that struvite application could improve the soil P availability and crop nutrient uptake then promote the crop yield. To increase the nutrient use efficiency of crops while ensuring crop yield and soil fertility, appropriate P reduction combined with struvite as a P fertilizer could be sustainable in the riceâ€“wheat rotation system in the long run.

TI  - Increasing yields while reducing soil nutrient accumulation by straw strip mulching in the dryland wheat ({Triticum} aestivum {L}.) cropping system of {Northwest} {China
VL  - 326
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface mulching is an effective strategy to increase yields in rainfed agroecosystems. The plastic film residue and overuse of chemical fertilizer cause a serious non-point source pollution and high production input cost. With mulching, farmers typically attempt to maintain the balance of soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer use while ensuring high yields. Straw strip mulching (SM) is a new mulching technique, but the effects on nutrient uptake have not been studied yet. Therefore, 19 field comparative experiments were conducted in four growth seasons of winter wheat with three mulching treatments: (1) straw strip mulch (SM), a partial ground mulching using whole corn stalks that alternate with planting strips without mulch; (2) full-field plastic film mulching (PM); and (3) no mulching with wheat sown in rows, as a control (CK). Compared with CK, on average over all experiments, SM increased grain yield by 11.5\%, biomass by 19.0\%, the total aboveground uptakes of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by 16.1\%, 18.4\% and 22.9\%. There were no significant differences between SM and CK in N and P requirements, the N, P and K concentrations in grain. The increased total aboveground uptake of each nutrient was closely associated with higher biomass, grain yield and straw yield (r = 0.66 âˆ’0.84, P {\textless} 0.01). Relative to CK, SM significantly decreased the total accumulation of residual NO3-N in the top 100 cm at maturity stage by 32.3\% (22.7 kg ha-1) in typical fertilization (N, 120 kg ha-1; P2O5, 90 kg ha-1) and by 33.8\% (45.8 kg ha-1) in high fertilization (N, 150 kg ha-1; P2O5, 120 kg ha-1), and the leaching of NO3-N into the deep soil below 40 cm. When only grain nutrients exported from the field after harvest in typical fertilization, N balance in SM, PM and CK accounted for 43.8\%, 38.5\% and 48.6\% of N input, while P balance for 74.8\%, 74.0\% and 78.4\% of P input, respectively, indicating possible saving potentials in fertilizer costs for all treatment, but the saving potential of P is much greater than that of N. Relative to PM, SM had similar the total aboveground nutrients uptake, similar to or slightly less grain yields, and higher economic benefit. SM is suitable for popularizing in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - The tree-based farming system is one of the finest options for crop diversification, ecological stabilisation and economic upliftment in the Indian Himalayan regions. Keeping this scenario in mind, an on-field experiment was conducted to assess the effect of Populus deltoides â€˜G-48â€™ tree spacings (S1:6 m Ã— 4 m, S2:4 m Ã— 4 m) with open-field condition (S0) and different nutrient sources [T1:Control; T2:100\% RDN (recommended dose of nitrogen); T3:75\% RDN + 25\% FYM (farmyard manure); T4:50\% RDN + 50\% FYM; T5:25\% RDN + 75\% FYM; T6:100\% FYM; T7:100\% Vermicompost); T8:Jeevamrut (10\%), each replicated thrice] on agronomic performance of Curcuma longa at Solan, India during 2019â€“2021. The results revealed that C. longa grown under tree spacing S1 coupled with the application of T3 treatment showed marked enhancement in growth, quality attributes of C. longa and post-harvest soil nutrient status whereas, yield attributes were better in S0. The yield of C. longa was curtailed by 22.5 and 31.6\%, whereas curcumin content was enhanced by 13.4\% and 12.2\% under S1 and S2, respectively over S0. The vegetation carbon density (66.38 Mg haâˆ’1), total ecosystem carbon density (119.04 Mg haâˆ’1), and total carbon sequestered (436.47 Mg haâˆ’1) was found to be higher under S1, whereas soil carbon density (55.68 Mg haâˆ’1) was maximum under S2 being at par with S1. Maximum net returns (14,693 US\$ haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1) were realised under S1 tree spacing and T3 treatment. Overall, the study concluded that in P. deltoidsâ€“C. longa system, application of 75\% RDN + 25\% FYM at 6 m Ã— 4 m spacing of poplar have demonstrated efficacy in getting a better quality of turmeric, maintaining soil fertility, and combating climate change.

AB  - Intensive agriculture relies mainly on the injudicious application of fertilizers. The importance of inherent soil fertility is often ignored owing to the complexity of the relationship between crop productivity and soil properties in the field with continuous fertilization. Here, our goal was to improve the understanding of long-term crop responses to soil nutrient availability. This study was one component of long-term nutrient management experiments conducted from 1993 to 2018. Field receiving standard fertilization before 2007 was divided into fertilized and non-fertilized plots. Fertilizer application was suspended in non-fertilized treatment since 2007 for 11 years, but control treatment continuously received standard fertilization (252â€“164â€“281 kg haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1 of Nâ€“Pâ€“K) from 1993 to 2018. Crop biomass and N uptake decreased by 29â€“69\% and 28â€“76\% of standard fertilization in wheat and maize, respectively from 2008 to 2011, and then stabilized at 10â€“41\% and 31â€“73\% of standard fertilization in wheat and maize, respectively, from 2012 to 2018. Spatial analysis of crop growth and soil characteristics showed that grain yields of both species after cessation of fertilization were associated with total and available soil N (r = 0.62â€“0.79). The large within-field yield variation (42â€“52\%) after 3 years of suspended fertilization resulted from a slight (9\%) variation in soil N availability. Cessation of fertilizer affected vegetative growth of wheat and reproductive growth of maize and both species showed different determinants of the yield formation processes under low soil fertility.

TI  - Impact of precursor crop and nitrogen fertilizer on the productivity of finger millet based cropping system and soil fertility in {Lake} {Tana} basin of {Ethiopia
VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - Traditional short-term diversification of annual crops for the purpose of improving soil fertility and food security is a common practice in Ethiopia. However, the best cropping systems have not been selected yet though field research. Experiments were conducted for two years with an objective of establishing sustained finger millet based short term cropping sequence in two major finger millet producing areas of Ethiopia. The experiments were laid out in a split-plot arrangement with six precursor crops (haricot bean, maize, sweet lupine, niger seed, wheat, and teff) as a main plot factor, where determined residues were retained in the main plot after harvesting and two nitrogen fertilizer levels (30 and 60kg haâˆ’1) applied for finger millet as sub-plots with three replications. Soil analysis result examined immediately after finger millet harvest showed a significant effect of precursor crops and nitrogen fertilizer rates on soil properties. Planting finger millet following lupine increased the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity by 17.37\%, 65.50\%, 26.15\%, respectively, over planting finger millet following teff. Use of different amount of nitrogen fertilizer likely contributed to observed differences in residual soil nutrients. Accordingly, finger millet following lupine with the addition of 60kg haâˆ’1 nitrogen fertilizer gave significantly higher finger millet grain yield (3.24 tone haâˆ’1) and relative production (22.37\%) and economic (40.7\%) efficiency. This system with their high sustainability and multiple benefits can be readily accepted by the farming community. Â© 2020, Â© 2020 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Impacts and mechanisms of nanobubbles level in drip irrigation system on soil fertility, water use efficiency and crop production: {The} perspective of soil microbial community
VL  - 333
SN  - NA
AB  - Rhizosphere hypoxia severely inhibited plant growth, reducing the crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in greenhouse crops. Irrigation using nanobubbles (NBs) has been an efficient method to increase crop yield and WUE by ameliorating hypoxic conditions and promoting plant growth. However, the potential effects and mechanisms of different oxygen concentrations in water enriched in nanobubbles (NBW) remain unclear. Herein, this study examined the influence of different total oxygen concentrations (TOCs, ranged between 160 and 280 mg Lâˆ’1) on tomato agronomic performance, soil fertility, and the bacterial community after a two-season of NBW irrigation. The results indicated that the tomato yield, WUE, soluble sugar, and vitamin C were significantly improved by NBs, showing the trends of rising to decrease with the corresponding oxygen concentration in irrigation water. The total C (TC), organic matter (OM), available N (AN) and K (AK) in soil tended to increase and then decrease with TOC in irrigation water. NB220 obtained the highest soil OM and AN values, and NB250 obtained the highest TC and AK values. The soil bacterial community composition gradually differentiated with increasing oxygen concentration. There were significant differences in relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae across the six oxygen levels. The keystones in the co-occurrence network were dependent on oxygen levels. FAPROTAX results revealed that bacterial functions of methanol oxidation, N fixation, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, and cellulolysis were more abundant in NB220 treated soils, consequently resulting in better crop yield, WUE, and soil fertility. Overall, the increased abundance of taxa participating in soil nutrient turnover contributed to improved soil fertility and crop agronomic performance. Our findings provided a significant opportunity to advance the understanding of oxygen threshold during aerated irrigation, with implications for green and efficient agricultural production.

AB  - Estimation of soil moisture variables is very important in agriculture studies such as precision irrigation and its management, so knowledge of the variation would be highly beneficial. Effective irrigation is possible with regular monitoring of soil and plant water conditions and with the forecasting of future crop water requirement. This study explored the capability of indices for estimating soil moisture as an indicator of detection irrigation time in sugarcane farms located in the southwest of Iran. For this goal, Landsat 8 satellite images were got from May until September 2015. Concurrent with the satellite pass times, field measurements include soil moisture (SM) and canopy temperature was done at the predefined points in sugarcane farms. These farms were selected with different age and irrigation days. Various indices were calculated using the combination of optical and thermal infrared wavelengths, and their relationship to the amount of SM was studied. According to the results of this research, vegetation indices based on optical bands do not show a good coefficient of determination (R-2). Results showed that soil moisture computed by crop water stress index (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have a similar trend, which showed that both indices can be used for irrigation scheduling, although they had some differences for computed soil moisture, TVDI had better correlation than to CWSI. TVDI indicated a good correlation with SM measurement data whichR(2)values range from 0.35 to 0.66, as well as inharmonious with the spatial distribution of (SM). It showed (RMSE) less than 0.2. Comparing recorded irrigation and (SM) in the farms shows that (SM) can be classified into three classes: low soil moisture (0.1 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.15), medium soil moisture (0.15 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.2) and high soil moisture (0.2 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.25). This classification can be utilized for precision irrigation scheduling in soils with heavy and semi-heavy texture (silty clay and silty clay loam). All of the results demonstrated that the TVDI can be utilized for assessment SM and determine irrigation time in agriculture lands, without each other in situ measurement of data.

TI  - Effect of different planting pattern arrangements on soil organic matter and soil nitrogen content under a maize/soybean strip relay intercropping system
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Assessing the spatial distribution of organic matter and total nitrogen in soil is essential for management and optimum utilization of fertilizers. Therefore, the present field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of different planting pattern arrangements on the spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen and organic matter content under a maize/soybean strip relay intercropping system. The planting was arranged in a manner such that soil sampling could be done from continuous maize/soybean relay strip intercropping (MS1), maize/soybean relay strip intercropping in rotation (MS2), traditional maize/soybean intercropping (MS3), sole maize (M), sole soybean (S), and fallow land (FL) from 2018 to 2020. The results showed significant variations for soil organic matter and total nitrogen content under different planting pattern arrangements of maize and soybean in the strip relay intercropping system. Across all systems, the highest soil organic matter (29.19 g/kg) and total nitrogen (10.19 g/kg) were recorded in MS2. In contrast, the lowest soil organic matter (1.69 g/kg) and total nitrogen (0.64 g/kg) were observed in FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL. Furthermore, under MS2, the spatial distribution of soil organic matter was higher in both maize and soybean crop rows as compared with other cropping patterns, whereas the soil total nitrogen was higher under soybean rows as compared with maize in all other treatment. However, correlation analysis of the treatments showed variations in organic matter content. It can be concluded that different planting patterns can have varying effects on soil organic matter and total nitrogen distribution under the strip relay intercropping system. Moreover, it is recommended from this study that MS2 is a better planting pattern for the strip relay intercropping system, which can increase the spatial distribution of soil organic matter and total nitrogen, thereby improving soil fertility, C:N ratio, and crop production. This study will serve as a foundation towards the scientific usage of chemical fertilizers in agricultural sector. Copyright Â© 2022 Te, Hassan, Cui, Xiao, Aslam, Saeed, Yang and Ali.

TI  - Effect of soil nutrient management and land configuration on rhizospheric microbial diversity under cotton\textit{ ({Gossypium}} spp.)-wheat\textit{ ({Triticum}}\textit{ aestivum)} cropping system in semi-arid region
VL  - 94
SN  - 0019-5022
AB  - Microbial diversities in the vicinity of root rhizosphere play a crucial role in promoting plant and soil ecosystem health and productivity. They have great potential as key indicators of soil health in agro-ecosystems enhancing the availability of nutrients. Therefore, a study was carried out during 2019-20 and 2020-21 at research farm of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana to investigate the rhizospheric microbial diversities under cotton (Gossypium spp.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system as affected by land configuration and nutrient management. Experiment consisted of 5 nutrient treatments replicated thrice and two land configurations, viz. raised bed (RB) and flatbed (FB) planned in factorial randomized block design (RBD). The results of experiment under RB revealed that farmyard manure (FYM) and FYM with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation (FYM + Org) showed the highest bacterial, fungal, phosphate solubilizing bacteria, azotobacter and actinomycetes population (6.92 to 7.51, 24.63 to 26.80, 7.61 to 7.68, 8.74 to 9.15,7.27 to 7.66 cfu/g soil, respectively). The decrease in microbial diversity was observed under inorganic fertilizer application through soil test crop response approach with targeted yield of 5.5 and 2.8 mg/ha (STCR5.5/2.8) and 6.0 and 3.2 mg/ha (STCR6.0/3.2) and control for cotton and wheat, respectively. Higher microbial population and soil organic carbon was found in RB compared to FB. The STCR5.5/2.8 and STCR6.0/3.2 recorded highest cotton and wheat yield followed by FYM and FYM+Org and least in control under cotton-wheat system. Thus, the study suggests that RB planting with an addition of manures along with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation could be a sustainable and feasible practice through enhanced microbial population raising soil fertility leading to increase the crop yields under semi-arid regions.

VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Citrus plants rely heavily on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) due to their lack of root hairs. Most experiments have been conducted with AMF inoculation under potted conditions, while field inoculation of AMF on citrus, especially a high economic hybrid tangor variety Beni-Madonna (Citrus nanko Ã— C. amakusa), has been rarely recorded. This study aimed to analyze the effects of two AMF inoculations (a single Funneliformis mosseae and a mixture of F. mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, and Rhizophagus intraradices) on the internal and external fruit quality, leaf antioxidant defense system, and soil fertility and structure of top-worked Beni-Madonna tangor citrus trees. Three and a half years after AMF inoculations, soil hyphal length and root mycorrhizal colonization rate increased by 61.2â€“101.8\% and 15.85â€“29.6\% in inoculated plants, respectively. Inoculated trees had higher external fruit coloration value, fruit horizontal diameter, and fruit weight, and lower fruit rigidity than uninoculated trees. AMF-inoculated trees had higher glucose levels of fruit peels, fructose and sucrose levels of fruit fleshes, and the ratio of fruit soluble solids/titratable acids, as well as lower titratable acids concentrations than non-AMF-inoculated trees. AMF inoculation significantly increased leaf nitrogen balance index, chlorophyll index, peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase activities, as well as reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione concentrations, resulting in lower hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels when compared to the uninoculated treatment. In addition, inoculated trees presented higher soil nutrient levels, including organic carbon, available K, and Olsen-P as, well as soil aggregate stability (based on mean weight diameter) than uninoculated trees. This study concluded that field AMF inoculation improved fruit quality, enhanced leaf antioxidant defense system, and improved soil fertility of Beni-Madonna trees, with mixed AMF being prominent in improving fruit quality and F. mosseae being prominent in enhancing leaf antioxidant defense system and improving soil fertility.

TI  - Soil nutrient variability mediates the effects of erosion on soil microbial communities: results from a modified topsoil removal method in an agricultural field in {Yunnan} plateau, {China
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil erosion can affect the nature and distribution of soil carbon and nutrients, directly and indirectly influencing microbially facilitated processes of mineralization, ammoniation, and nitrification, thus affecting soil nutrients cycling. However, little is known about how soil erosion affects soil microorganisms. Since 2012, we conducted a modified soil erosion simulation experiment of topsoil removal method in an agricultural field to simulate erosion depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm versus a control (0 cm). The results showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominant soil microbial (here: Bacteria and Archaea) phyla, and Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, and Actinospica were the dominant genera in all samples. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Thaumarchaeota, Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, Actinospica, and Rhodanobacter decreased with the increase of erosion depths, while Chloroflexi and Firmicutes increased with the increase of erosion depths. Soil microbial community structure was altered significantly at 30- and 40-cm soil erosion depth in comparison to control. Soil nutrient variability caused by soil erosion had a greater impact on soil microbial community composition than that of soil mechanical composition. Soil erosion indirectly affected microbial community composition through negative effects on soil available potassium, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and sand content. We thus highlight the importance of soil nutrients monitoring in different soil erosion levels to make the proper ecological restoration strategies to improve soil environment which soil microorganisms depend on.

TI  - Soil chemistry, metabarcoding, and metabolome analyses reveal that a sugarcane-{Dictyophora} indusiata intercropping system can enhance soil health by  reducing soil nitrogen loss.
VL  - 14
SN  - 1664-302X
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Greater amounts of fertilizer are applied every year to meet the growing demand for food. Sugarcane is one of the important food sources for human  beings. METHODS: Here, we evaluated the effects of a sugarcane-Dictyophora  indusiata (DI) intercropping system on soil health by conducting an experiment  with three different treatments: (1) bagasse application (BAS process), (2)  bagasseâ€‰+â€‰DI (DIS process), and (3) the control (CK). We then analyzed soil  chemistry, the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, and the composition of  metabolites to clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of this intercropping  system on soil properties. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Soil chemistry analyses  revealed that the content of several soil nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and  phosphorus (P) was higher in the BAS process than in the CK. In the DIS process,  a large amount of soil P was consumed by DI. At the same time, the urease  activity was inhibited, thus slowing down the loss of soil in the DI process,  while the activity of other enzymes such as Î²-glucosidase and laccase was  increased. It was also noticed that the content of lanthanum and calcium was  higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and DI did not  significantly alter the concentrations of these soil metal ions. Bacterial  diversity was higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and fungal  diversity was lower in the DIS process than in the other treatments. The soil  metabolome analysis revealed that the abundance of carbohydrate metabolites was  significantly lower in the BAS process than in the CK and the DIS process. The  abundance of D(+)-talose was correlated with the content of soil nutrients. Path  analysis revealed that the content of soil nutrients in the DIS process was  mainly affected by fungi, bacteria, the soil metabolome, and soil enzyme  activity. Our findings indicate that the sugarcane-DIS intercropping system can  enhance soil health.

TI  - Soil nitrogen availability and microbial carbon use efficiency are dependent more on chemical fertilization than winter drought in a maize-soybean rotation system.
VL  - 15
SN  - 1664-302X
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) availability is one of the limiting factors of crop productivity, and it is strongly influenced by global change and agricultural  management practices. However, very few studies have assessed how the winter  drought affected soil N availability during the subsequent growing season under  chemical fertilization. We conducted a field investigation involving snow removal  to simulate winter drought conditions in a Mollisol cropland in Northeast China  as part of a 6-year fertilization experiment, and we examined soil  physicochemical properties, microbial characteristics, and N availability. Our  results demonstrated that chemical fertilization significantly increased soil  ammonium and total N availability by 42.9 and 90.3\%, respectively; a combined  winter drought and fertilization treatment exhibited the highest soil N  availability at the end of the growing season. As the growing season continued,  the variation in soil N availability was explained more by fertilization than by  winter drought. The Mantel test further indicated that soil Olsen-P content and  microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) were significantly related to soil ammonium  availability. A microbial community structure explained the largest fraction of  the variation in soil nitrate availability. Microbial CUE showed the strongest  correlation with soil N availability, followed by soil available C:P and  bacteria:fungi ratios under winter drought and chemical fertilization conditions.  Overall, we clarified that, despite the weak effect of the winter drought on soil  N availability, it cannot be ignored. Our study also identified the important  role of soil microorganisms in soil N transformations, even in seasonally  snow-covered northern croplands.

TI  - Supplementing nitrogen in combination with rhizobium inoculation and soil mulch in peanut (arachis hypogaea l.) production system: {Part} i. effects on productivity, soil moisture, and nutrient dynamics
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) are the world's fourth-most important source of edible oil and the third-most valuable source of high-quality vegetable protein; they also contain carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals essential for good human nutrition. Peanuts area particularly valuable crop in tropical and subtropical regions. While the demand for peanuts is increasing globally, there is a significant gap in nitrogen supply and demand in peanut production systems. To alleviate this, nitrogen fertilizers are often applied indiscriminately; this practice leads to the deterioration of indigenous soil fertility and to a long-term decline in crop productivity. Considering these aspects of soil health, a field study was conducted over two consecutive winter (November-March) seasons in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 at the research farm of the agricultural university Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya inWest Bengal, India. This study examined supplementing different levels of nitrogen fertilizer with rhizobium and soil mulch in an irrigated peanut crop. The effects of these management interventions were evaluated in terms of crop productivity, nutrient dynamics, soil moisture, and the soil microbial activity. Peanuts grown with the 100\% recommended dose of nitrogen, which was applied with rhizobium and grown under polythene mulching, recorded the highest average pod yield (3.87 and 3.96 t ha-1 in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017) and average kernel yield (2.88 and 2.99 t ha-1) in both growing seasons. This treatment also resulted in the greatest accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium by the peanut plants. In contrast, the maximum soil moisture distribution and the greatest total root zone moisture content were observed in the treatment with only rhizobium under the polythene mulch (i.e., no nitrogen was applied). The populations of soil bacteria and rhizobia were highest in the treatment where nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the crop at 75\% of the recommended rate combined with rhizobium and under polythene mulch. After two cropping seasons, the peanut crop grown under polythene mulch with rhizobium and with nitrogen fertilizer applied at either the full recommended rate or 75\% of this rate performed best in terms of crop productivity, soil nutrient dynamics, and soil moisture.

TI  - Simulating and predicting crop yield and soil fertility under climate change with fertilizer management in northeast {China} based on the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The risks of climate change and soil degradation for the agricultural environment and crop production are increasingly prominent. Based on the limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a 36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8\%, 7.7\%, and 6.2\%, respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP scenarios increased by 20.2\%-33.5\% and 13.7\%-21.7\% compared with that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is a sustainab Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Long-term imbalance in fertilization has resulted in a serious decline in potassium (K) fertility in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Understanding of the complex responses of soil microbial communities and enzyme activities to different K fertilizer measures while maintaining soil K balance can provide a scientific basis for rational application of K fertilizer. Two field experiment sites (JY, loam soil with high pH and K fertility; GD, silty loam soil with low pH and K fertility) were selected to study the effects of K fertilizer management on enzyme activities and bacterial communities under soil K balance condition. K fertilizer treatments included no K fertilizer (K0), straw return combined with K fertilizer (SRK), and inorganic K fertilizer only (IK). Soil bacterial communities were examined using MiSeq sequencing. Wheat yield, soil nutrient contents, and enzyme activities were higher in the SRK than in the IK and K0 treatments. Available K was the most important factor affecting wheat yield. The SRK and IK treatments significantly altered bacterial communities and enzyme activities, which in turn affected the cycling of soil nutrients. The positive effect of the SRK treatment on wheat yield, enzyme activities, and potential bacterial functions in silty loam soil was greater than that in loam soil, which was closely related to soil texture, pH, and K fertility. The SRK measure is a promising approach to maintain crop yield and soil fertility and more necessary to be adopted in silty loam soil with low pH and K fertility.

AB  - The uneven rainfall distribution, limited soil nutrients, and continuous cropping effect in the Loess Plateau restrict the sustainable development of fruit tree/crop (soybean and maize) intercropping systems. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different water and fertilizer regimes on the soil nutrients and growth of intercropping systems during the crop replacement period. The experiment involved three irrigation levels (0\% (I0), 50\% (I1), and 80\% (I2) of field capacity), two irrigation methods (drip irrigation (DI) and flood irrigation (FI)), and three fertilizer application rates (0 (F0), 375 (F1), and 750 (F2) kg/hm2). The results showed that in 2020 and 2021, the soil water contents increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization. The soil ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and soil organic matter contents in 2021 were 21.0\%â€“68.4\% higher than those in 2020. Increasing the fertilizer application rate improved the photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate of apples and maize in 2020 but had a reverse U-shape effect on soybeans in 2021. Irrigation and fertilization increased soybean and maize yields by 2.9\%â€“30.5\% compared with the I0F0 treatment. The maize root indicators generally showed an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend with increasing fertilizer application in 2020, while soybean exhibited an opposite pattern in 2021. The FI1F1 and DI2F2 treatments yielded the optimal economic benefit in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, FI and DI would have been recommended in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Factor analysis suggested that the DI2F2 treatments had the highest comprehensive benefits over the two years studied. Therefore, we recommend using DI combined with 80\% field capacity irrigation and 750 kg/hm2 fertilization to maximize the comprehensive benefits of intercropping systems during the crop replacement period.

VL  - 177
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the impacts of plant age on bamboo growth, soil nutrient and functional microorganism can assist in the development of management practices to maximize the benefits of nutrients and functional endophytic and soil microbes in moso bamboo plantations. In this study, moso bamboos of different ages (0.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 years) were selected. The above-ground biomass, soil properties and endophytic microbes of above-ground tissue and stump root of different age bamboos were quantified, and their interactive relationships were also examined. There were negligible differences in the heights and above-ground fresh biomass among the bamboo plants of different ages, but net nitrogen (N) mineralization and potential nitrification rates of soils were significantly affected by the bamboo ages. The soil nprA gene abundances decreased with the bamboo ages, and soil AOB amoA gene abundances of the 0.5-yr bamboo were significantly higher than those of the other older plants. Average soil urease activities of the 2.5-yr, 4.5-yr and 6.5-yr bamboos were 81.4\%, 81.1\% and 88.2\% lower than those of the 0.5-yr bamboo, respectively. Bacterial diversity indices and richness estimators in the soils were significantly higher than those in the above-ground tissues. Endophytic microbial community structures were more sensitive to the bamboo ages than the soil counterparts, and endophytic microbial community diversities and structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly changed with the bamboo ages. Bacterial and fungal community structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly different from those in the soils. Bamboo ages significantly affected the N transformations in the soils and endophytic community structures, but niche differentiations among the above-ground tissue, stump root and soil outweighed the plant ages in shaping the whole microbial communities of plant-soil system.

VL  - 307
SN  - NA
AB  - The long-term continuous mono-cropping and application of large amount of chemical fertilizers have led to a dramatic degradation of soil quality in the intensive vegetable production system. It is important to develop more sustainable, environmentally friendly and high-efficiency agroecosystems for vegetable production in plastic shed systems. Field experiments were performed to explore the impacts of Bacillus megaterium application on cucumber yields, the bioavailability of soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), properties of soil microbial communities in a plastic shed production system with cucumber mono-cropped for more than 15 years. The field trails were set up with four treatments of conventional fertilization as control (CON), conventional fertilization with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM), conventional fertilization reduced by 10 \% P and 10 \% (or 5 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM - PK1), conventional fertilization reduced by 20 \% P and 20 \% (or 10 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM - PK2). Results illustrated that CON + BM treatment significantly increased the cucumber yields by 11.8 \%â€“15.2 \% and P and K accumulation in cucumber fruits and roots by 27.5 \%â€“46.1 \% and 17.8 \%â€“45.1 \%, respectively. The treatments of CON + BM - PK1 and CON + BM - PK2 did not decrease the yields and quality of cucumber, and the bioavailability of soil P and K compared with CON + BM. Moreover, the strain of Bacillus megaterium can efficiently colonize the soil at the early stage of inoculation and improved the richness of soil bacterial and fungal communities significantly. High-throughput sequencing identified that the application of Bacillus megaterium did not change the compositions of the predominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and predominant fungal phylum Ascomycota in soil, but increased the relative abundances of the beneficial bacterial genera and fungal orders and suppressed the development of pathogenic bacterial genus significantly. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the structures of soil bacterial and fungal communities in the CON + BM treatment were dramatically separated from CON at the early stage of inoculation. Moreover, soil pH, available K (AK), total P (TP), and total K (TK) were dramatically related to the changes of soil bacterial community structure, while soil AK and TK were dramatically linked to the variations of soil fungal community structure. The findings indicated that the application of Bacillus megaterium might contribute to the development of a more sustainable production system of vegetables in plastic shed via improving the properties of soil microbial community and the bioavailability of soil P and K.

TI  - Effects of a decade of organic fertilizer substitution on vegetable yield and soil phosphorus pools, phosphatase activities, and the microbial community in a greenhouse vegetable production system
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Partial substitution of chemical fertilizers by organic amendments is adopted widely for promoting the availability of soil phosphorus (P) in agricultural production. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effects of long-term organic substitution on soil P availability and microbial activity in greenhouse vegetable fields. A 10-year (2009â€“2019) field experiment was carried out to investigate the impacts of organic fertilizer substitution on soil P pools, phosphatase activities and the microbial community, and identify factors that regulate these soil P transformation characteristics. Four treatments included 100\% chemical N fertilizer (4CN), 50\% substitution of chemical N by manure (2CN+2MN), straw (2CN+2SN), and combined manure with straw (2CN+1MN+1SN). Compared with the 4CN treatment, organic substitution treatments increased celery and tomato yields by 6.9âˆ’13.8\% and 8.6âˆ’18.1\%, respectively, with the highest yields being in the 2CN+1MN+1SN treatment. After 10 years of fertilization, organic substitution treatments reduced total P and inorganic P accumulation, increased the concentrations of available P, organic P, and microbial biomass P, and promoted phosphatase activities (alkaline and acid phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase) and microbial growth in comparison with the 4CN treatment. Further, organic substitution treatments significantly increased soil C/P, and the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that the soil C/P ratio directly and significantly affected phosphatase activities and the microbial biomass and positively influenced soil P pools and vegetable yield. Partial least squares (PLS) regression demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi positively affected phosphatase activities. Our results suggest that organic fertilizer substitution can promote soil P transformation and availability. Combining manure with straw was more effective than applying these materials separately for developing sustainable P management practices. Â© 2022 CAAS. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during Kharif and Summer seasons for two consecutive years of 2016-17 and 2017-18 with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), grown in a sequence at Zonal Agricultural Research Station, Mandya on an acid soil to study the effect of biochar, lime and mangala setright on yield, nutrient uptake and fertility status of an acidic soil. Application of biochar along with soil test value based fertilizer (STV) + FYM + ZnSO4 influenced the productivity of rice and cowpea of 104.82 q haâˆ’1 and 2474.77 kg haâˆ’1, respectively and the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium by rice (107.72, 28.16 and 69.34 kg haâˆ’1, respectively) and cowpea (68.06, 5.86 and 38.67 kg haâˆ’1, respectively) significantly, which was found on par with application of biochar along with RDF + FYM + ZnSO4. The soil pH (6.01), organic carbon content (5.03 g kgâˆ’1) and available nitrogen (340.45 kg haâˆ’1), phosphorus (39.45 kg haâˆ’1) and potassium (166.45 kg haâˆ’1) significantly increased through the integrated use of biochar, FYM, ZnSO4 and fertilizers. Yield and soil properties like soil pH, organic carbon content and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium significantly increased with application of lime and mangala setright as compared to farmerâ€™s practice. Highest net income and benefit:cost ratio (2.65) was obtained with integration of soil test value based fertilizer application, FYM and biochar. Significant reduction in the productivity of crop and soil fertility was recorded in farmerâ€™s practice. Â© 2020, Â© 2020 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Soil extracellular enzyme activities play an important role in regulating the soil nitrogen (N) mineralization process in paddy fields. However, there is still a need to further study how N mineralization responds to different fertilizer management techniques and the soil extracellular enzyme activities for N mineralization in paddy fields. Therefore, the influence of different long-term (35 years) fertilizer regimes on soil N mineralization, hydrolysable N fractionsâ€”such as hydrolyzed unknown nitrogen (HUN), amino acid nitrogen (AAN), amino sugar nitrogen (ASN), ammonia nitrogen (AN), and total acid-hydrolyzed nitrogen (TAN)â€”and their extracellular enzyme activities (soil urease, L-glutaminase, Î²-glucosidase, arylamidase, and Î²-glucosaminidase) in a double-cropping rice field in southern China were investigated in this study. The field experiment included the following fertilizer regimes: rice straw and inorganic fertilizer (RF), 30\% organic manure and 70\% inorganic fertilizer (OM), inorganic fertilizer alone (MF), and no application of inorganic fertilizer as a control (CK). The results show that the soil ammonium N, amino sugar N, hydrolysable unidentified N, and amino acid N contents in the paddy field with RF treatment increased by 30.56\%, 5.51\%, and 62.74\% compared with the CK treatment. The results show that the soil aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in the paddy fields with OM and RF treatments increased by 22.92\% and 18.27\% compared with those with MF treatment. Moreover, soil extracellular enzyme activities under RF and OM treatments significantly increased, which indicated that the main substrate of microbial activity was effective. Correlation analysis indicated that the soil L-glutaminase activity, amino sugar N, amino acid N, and total acid-hydrolysable N contents were positively correlated with soil aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in paddy fields. However, there was a negative correlation between the soil N mineralization rate and soil Î²-glucosaminidase activity in paddy fields. This finding shows that the yields of early rice and late rice under the RF and OM treatments were significantly higher than those under the MF and CK treatments. Compared with the MF treatment, the yields of double-cropping rice with RF and OM treatments increased by 9.84\% and 11.37\%, respectively. As a result, the application of straw or organic manure and inorganic fertilizer was effective for improving soil N mineralization, the soil acid-hydrolyzed N content, and extracellular enzyme activities in double-cropping rice fields.

TI  - Organic production systems in northern highbush blueberry: {II}. {Impact} of planting method, cultivar, fertilizer, and mulch on leaf and soil nutrient concentrations and relationships with yield from planting through maturity
VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - The impact of various production systems on leaf nutrient concentration and soil organic matter, pH, and nutrient status was evaluated from the first growing season (2007) through maturity (2016) in a certified organic planting of northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). Treatments included planting method (on raised beds or flat ground), fertilizer source (granular feather meal or fish solubles) and rate (â€˜â€˜lowâ€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜highâ€™â€™ rates of 29 and 57 kgÂ·haL1 N, respectively, during establishment, increased incrementally as the planting matured to 73 and 140 kgÂ·haL1 N, respectively), mulch [sawdust, yard-debris compost topped with sawdust (compost + sawdust), or black, woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat)], and cultivar (Duke or Liberty). Mulches were replenished, as needed, and weeds were controlled throughout the study. The impacts of year, planting method, fertilizer, mulch, and cultivar on leaf and soil nutrient levels over this 10-year study were complex with many interactions among treatments. Soil pH remained within the recommended range for all treatments. Plants fertilized with fish solubles had higher leaf N, P, and K concentrations than those fertilized with feather meal, particularly at the high N rate in both cultivars. By contrast, fertilization with feather meal increased leaf Ca. Compost + sawdust added a cumulative (2007â€“16) total of 2274, 400, 961, and 2744 kgÂ·haL1 of N, P, K, and Ca, respectively, over the use of sawdust alone, and increased the concentration of P, K (as much as 90\%), Ca, and Mg in the soil relative to other mulches. Soil organic matter content averaged 4.1\% under compost + sawdust, 3.3\% under sawdust, and 2.9\% under weed mat, averaged over the last 5 years. Mulching with weed mat or compost + sawdust increased leaf K compared with sawdust in both cultivars, regardless of fertilizer treatment. Leaf Ca, on the other hand, was highest with sawdust and tended to be lowest with weed mat in both cultivars. Soil nutrient levels were not consistently correlated with leaf nutrient concentrations, other than between soil NO3-N and leaf N (5 years) and between soil and leaf K (4 years). On average, raised beds resulted in higher concentrations of N, P, K, Fe, and Al and lower concentrations of Ca, Mg, and B in the leaves than planting on flat ground. Furthermore, concentrations of N and Ca in recent fully-expanded leaves at standard sampling time was higher in young plants than in mature plants in both cultivars, whereas the opposite was found for leaf P. In â€˜Dukeâ€™, yield was positively correlated with leaf Ca in 8 out of 9 years and negatively correlated with leaf K and P in 5 and 6 years, respectively. Leaf Ca and Mg were also negatively correlated with leaf K in most years for both cultivars, as was leaf N. Although leaf N concentration was higher with added compost, regardless of fertilizer source in â€˜Dukeâ€™, and when fertilized with feather meal in â€˜Libertyâ€™, this was not correlated with yield. High N rates increased leaf N concentration, but did not result in greater yield. While soil and leaf tissue testing are important to help manage fertilizer programs, the lack of a consistent relationship between soil and plant nutrient status and yield was a reflection of the complicated interactions that occurred among nutrients in these organic production systems. Soil nutrient imbalances and changes in leaf nutrient concentrations associated with extended use of compost + sawdust mulch and fish solubles may lead to growth and yield problems in longer-lived plantings. In addition, the loss of organic matter under weed mat would need to be addressed in long-term plantings for sustainable production. Â© 2019 American Society for Horticultural Science.

VL  - 31
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurately simulating the soil nitrogen (N) cycle is crucial for assessing food security and resource utilization efficiency. The accuracy of model predictions relies heavily on model parameterization. The sensitivity and uncertainty of the simulations of soil N cycle of winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP) to the parameters were analyzed. First, the N module in the Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP) model was expanded to capture the dynamics of soil N cycle calibrated with field measurements in three ecological stations from 2000 to 2015. Second, the Morris and Sobolâ€² algorithms were adopted to identify the sensitive parameters that impact soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate. Finally, the shuffled complex evolution developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to optimize the selected sensitive parameters to improve prediction accuracy. The results showed that the sensitive parameters related to soil nitrate stock included the potential nitrification rate, Michaelis constant, microbial C/N ratio, and slow humus C/N ratio, the sensitive parameters related to denitrification rate were the potential denitrification rate, Michaelis constant, and N2 O production rate, and the sensitive parameters related to ammonia volatilization rate included the coefficient of ammonia volatilization exchange and potential nitrification rate. Based on the optimized parameters, prediction efficiency was notably increased with the highest coefficient of determination being approximately 0.8. Moreover, the average relative interval length at the 95\% confidence level for soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate were 11.92, 0.008, and 4.26, respectively, and the percentages of coverage of the measured values in the 95\% confidence interval were 68\%, 86\%, and 92\%, respectively. By identifying sensitive parameters related to soil N, the expanded VIP model optimized by the SCE-UA algorithm can effectively simulate the dynamics of soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate in the NCP.

TI  - Effects of electrical conductivity on uncoated- and coated-rods of eight electromagnetic soil water content sensors
VL  - 355
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content stands as a pivotal parameter across numerous research disciplines and engineering applications. Electromagnetic (EM) sensors have gained widespread usage in monitoring soil water content. While commonly employed sensors are suitable for typical agronomic- or landscape-soil environments, they may exhibit significant deviations under conditions of high-salinity or -electrical conductivity (EC). We investigated sensing limits under the influence of increasing EC and the resulting accuracy of dielectric permittivity (Îµ) determinations using commercial soil water content sensors. Tests were conducted using eight commercially available EM sensors (CS655, HydraProbe II, TDR-305N, TDR-310N, TDR-315N, TEROS 12, TEROS ONE, and WET150). For these uncoated rod sensors, most were accurate within Â±3 \% relative permittivity errors in saline solutions within the range of 0â€’4 dS mâˆ’1 while TDR-305N, TEROS ONE and WET150 maintained an accuracy of 5 \% for EC values up to 9.24 dS mâˆ’1. We explored extending the working range of some sensors to high-saline environments by adding an insulating coating on sensor rods. Since the coated probe not only perceives the characteristics of the immersed medium but also interacts with the coating material itself, a calibration model was evaluated for determining the actual Îµ of the evaluated medium. The strong correlation between a four-point calibration and the model demonstrates the effectiveness of calibrating coated EM sensors for Îµ determination using only a limited number of calibration materials. The findings presented here could serve as a valuable resource when selecting EM sensors for use in high-saline environments. Results also shed light on the potential to extend the sensing range through the integration of insulating coatings. Â© 2024

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility indicators based on remote sensing data
VL  - 113
SN  - NA
AB  - The article discusses the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to predict soil fertility based on remote sensing data. The research object was 70 soil samples taken in the village of Vshchizh, Bryansk region. Multispectral imaging of the earth's surface from the Sentinel-2 satellite was also used to assess the soil condition. The study in this article is based on the indicators of humus (\%), P2O5 (mg/kg), and K2O (mg/kg). The prediction is done using a neural network model based on the Rosenblatt perceptron. Data analysis is conducted using the statistical software environment RStudio. The results of the model show the values of the total mean square error (MSE): MSE=0.178 for humus prediction, MSE=0.138 for P2O5 prediction, MSE=0.171 for K2O prediction. Additionally, the program calculated the correlation values between the predicted and calculated soil fertility. K(humus)=0.548, K(P2O5)=0.287, K(K2O)=0.244. Thus, the neural network most accurately predicted soil fertility based on the humus content. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

TI  - Microgranular biochar improves soil fertility and mycorrhization in crop systems
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Intensive agricultural practices have accelerated soil organic carbon mineralization, compromising soil health and function. This study evaluated the efficacy of microgranular biochar (MicroCHAR) and powdered biochar as soil additives enhancing soil function, and pea, maize and wheat growth and yield. We carried out a series of experiments with degraded drought-prone soils in greenhouse and field conditions, combining biochar addition with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The combination of amendments variously impacted soil nutrient status; availability of extractable potassium (K) increased in all cases, whilst that of calcium (Ca) was reduced when AMF inoculation was applied alone but not in combination with biochar. MicroCHAR positively affected root biomass and pea P content compared with the control, but biochar did not enhance N or K. Crop yield was not significantly increased by MicroCHAR amendment. MicroCHAR enhanced the mycorrhization rate of crop roots by 260\%, an effect seen in the greenhouse and field conditions. This study suggests that credible benefits in some crops can be gained by the application of MicroCHAR to some soils. Observed effects may be soil and crop specific; future study of optimal nutrient and microorganism coatings on microgranular biochar opens exciting avenues for the improvement of crop yields in degraded agricultural soils.

TI  - Enhancing maize ({Zea} mays {L}.) yields in limited fertilizer farming systems through soil nutrient recycling in {Sub}-{Saharan} {Africa
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is dominated by small holder-farmers who have limited access to chemical fertilizers. This study was conducted in Eastern Uganda with a primary objective to investigate the intricate relationship between crop residue quality, soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization, and their collective impact on maize yields and residue quality. Employing a randomized completely block design (RCBD) over a two-year period (2013 â€“ 2014), the study involved cattle manure, Tithonia compost each applied at 2t/ha, and maize residues which was applied at 4t/ha. Maize grain yield, maize stover and soil properties were measured at the harvesting period. Particularly, soil from each treatment plots and control was collected for laboratory chemical analysis to determine the Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus (P), potassium (K) content. At the end of each growing period, maize residues were also collected and analysed for the N, P, K content. Carbon (C) and N mineralization experiments were conducted in the laboratory that tested the potential of these organic amendments for soil nutrient release. In 2013 maize grain yield increased by 87, 27 and 13\% following the application of cattle manure, Tithonia compost and maize residues compared to control plots, respectively. In 2014 maize grain yields improved significantly from 59\% to 106\% in plots with organic amendments. Over the two years, maize stover yield increased by 25\% in the first year and a 56\% in the second year compared to control plots. The impact of these organic materials also resulted in the doubling of N, P and K content in maize residues, particularly when cattle manure and Tithonia compost were applied. This, in turn, resulted in improved carbon mineralization and enhanced net nitrogen mineralization. This study demonstrated that application of organic soil amendments improves both maize yields and the quantity and quality of subsequent maize residues. For better results long-term application of these organic amendments and maize residues have the potential to reduce the need for additional inputs and could support a more sustainable and economically viable approach to maize production.

TI  - Portable internet of things-based soil nutrients monitoring for precision and efficient smart farming
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper describes the design and implementation of a portable internet of things (IoT)-based system for online monitoring of soil nutrients, specifically nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), to improve precision and efficiency in smart farming. The main goal is to use IoT technology to analyze soil conditions on-site and provide advice about fertilization and soil management. The system measures soil nutrient levels using field-based sensors, such as an NPK probe, and transmits data over a wireless sensor network. The research comprises a quantitative evaluation of the performance of the IoT system using various sensors. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the accuracy of the IoT device with industrial soil nutrient measurement equipment, demonstrating differences in P and K values but not in N values. This disparity points to certain areas where the accuracy of the P and K measurements in the IoT system should be improved. This IoT-based soil nutrient monitoring system highlights the potential of smart farming technology to boost agricultural output, optimize resource consumption, and support sustainable farming practices. The system's portability and online data availability provide farmers with exact soil condition information, allowing them to make more efficient and intelligent farming decisions.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - This research was to examine the impacts of long-term integrated riceâ€“crayfish farming on soil nutrients, carbon pools, and rice yields in paddy fields. The aim was to establish a scientific basis for the sustainable development of RS in the northern region of Zhejiang. The results showed that the change from rice monoculture (CK) to riceâ€“crayfish coculture systems (RS) led to a 24.99\% increase in the 5-year average of soil ammonium nitrogen (AN), while the soil nitrate nitrogen (NN), available potassium (AK), and available phosphorus content (AP) decreased by 28.02\%, 16.05\%, and 28.76\%, respectively. Moreover, the total organic carbon (TOC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) exhibited a reduction of 2.45\%, 8.82\%, 35.31\%, and 65.84\%, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between NN, EOC, and MBC in the RS mode. In terms of rice yield, the 5-year average of rice yield in RS decreased by 8.40\% compared to CK. The mean yield of early-maturing rice varieties was reduced by 13.16\%, while that of late-maturing rice varieties was reduced by 6.00\%. These results shed light on the annual variation in soil nutrients, carbon pools, and rice yield in the RS mode, providing insights for the sustainable development of RS in northern Zhejiang.

TI  - Effects of silvopastoral systems on soil nutrient properties in the low hilly area of western {Henan} province, {China
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - Silvopastoral systems are widely used for ecological vegetation restoration in fragile areas. As the main landform of western Henan, the low hilly areas are experiencing water and soil loss because of human activities. However, the effect of silvopastoral systems on soil nutrients in low hilly areas has not been well studied. To address this issue, we established a silvopastoral experiment in the low hilly area of western Henan province in 2011, where four plots of pure forest of poplar (Populus simonii, PS), oriental thuja (Platycladus orientalis, PO), Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis, QV) and false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia, RP) was planted on a natural wasteland; perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa, MS) was intercropped with these pure forest plots as silvopastoral treatments, i.e., PS-MS, PO-MS, QV-MS and RP-MS; one plot of natural wasteland as CK. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, we examined the soil total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) of different vegetation restorations. Results showed that the silvopastoral treatments (PO-MS, QV-MS and RP-MS) generally increased the TC and TN (by 53\% and 51\% in 2018, 66\% and 49\% in 2019, and 66\% and 67\% in 2020, respectively) compared to the pure forest treatments, and were also higher than the M and PS-MS. The change in relative TC and TN between downslope and upslope positions is higher in PS and PO, lower in RP compared to the PS-MS and PO-MS, RP-MS respectively, and non-different between QV and QV-MS. In summary, soil nutrient properties are generally higher but vary among the slope positions in the silvopastoral treatments compared to pure forest treatments in the low hilly area.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a key parameter for land surface hydrological processes. In recent years, satellite remote sensing images have been widely used for SSM estimation, and many methods based on satellite-derived spectral indices have also been used to estimate the SSM content in various climatic conditions and geographic locations. However, achieving an accurate estimation of SSM content at a high spatial resolution remains a challenge. Therefore, improving the precision of SSM estimation through the synergies of multi-source remote sensing data has become imperative, particularly for informing forest management practices. In this study, the integration of multi-source remote sensing data with random forest and support vector machine models was conducted using Google Earth Engine in order to estimate the SSM content and develop SSM maps for temperate forests in central Japan. The synergy of Sentinel-2 and terrain factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, slope steepness, and valley depth, with the random forest model provided the most suitable approach for SSM estimation, yielding the highest accuracy values (overall accuracy for testing = 91.80\%, Kappa = 87.18\%, r = 0.98) for the temperate forests of central Japan. This finding provides more valuable information for SSM mapping, which shows promise for precision forestry applications. Â© 2024 by the authors.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry systems can fully exploit the ecological benefits of an ecosystemâ€™s component plants, and improve the ecological environment, soil quality, and land use efficiency, all of which have recently attracted the attention of many scholars. Southwest Chinaâ€™s karst graben basins have barren soil that needs immediate improvement. The karst graben basin in southwest China was used for this study to examine the impacts of several forestâ€“grass composite systems of Bingtang orangeâ€“alfalfaâ€“ryegrass on soil improvement, which is located in Jianshui County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. The experiment had four treatments, Bingtang orangeâ€“alfalfa sowing (B2), Bingtang orangeâ€“ryegrass Ã— alfalfa mixed sowing (A), Bingtang orangeâ€“ryegrass Ã— alfalfa intercropping (R), and Bingtang orange monocropping (CK). The results showed that different forestâ€“grass composite patterns had noticeable effects on improving the soilâ€™s organic carbon (SOC), total nutrients, and available nutrients, especially in the rainy season when plants grew vigorously. Forage grass intercropping under forest exerted the best effect on soil improvement in the surface layer, and the effect decreased with the increase in soil depth. Alfalfa intercropping under Bingtang orange forest had the strongest effect on improving SOC, total N, ammonia nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen, whose content increased by 30.7\%, 27.3\%, 35\%, and 36.3\%, respectively, in the dry season and 38\%, 46.7\%, 48.7\%, and 55.3\%, in the rainy season. However, the effect of alfalfaâ€“ryegrass intercropping under the Bingtang orange forest on soil total P, total K, and available P was better than that of the Bingtang orangeâ€“alfalfa intercropping system. The C:N ratio is more suitable in the Bingtang orangeâ€“ryegrass-alfalfa composite system. Forage grass intercropping under the Bingtang orange forest effectively improved the soil NPK and C status, and the results of this study provided a basis for the selection of forestâ€“grass composite patterns for soil improvement.

TI  - Plant species richness in agroforestry systems correlates to soil fertility in the humid tropic of {Mexico
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - Given the importance of agroforestry systems (AFS) in mitigating the impact of agriculture on the ecosystems and environment, it is critical to understand the effect of plant species richness in diverse tropical AFS on their soil properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of different AFS in the conservation of plant species richness, and their effect on soil physical and chemical properties. We compared plant species richness and soil properties among six AFS by sampling 63 plots in the humid tropics. Sampled AFS include: (1) home garden (HG), (2) shade trees in plantation (ShTP), (3) live fences (LF), (4) scattered trees in paddocks (ScTP), (5) grazing under plantation (GP), and (6) slash and burn agriculture (SBA). The vegetation community in each plot was recorded by scientific name and species richness was calculated. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depth and analyzed for pH, organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and texture. The highest plant species richness was found in HG (125), ShTP (121), and ScTP (89), followed by GP (56), LF (35), and SBA (4). This richness of plant species influenced the soil N (r = 0.514, P = 0.028), P (r = 0.480, P = 0.514), and OM contents (r = 0.439, P = 0.067), as well as CEC (r = 0.402, P = 0.097), EC (r = 0.153, P = 0.543), and pH (r = 0.363, P = 0.115). The highest values of pH (6.6) and P (8.14 mg kgâˆ’1) were observed in the species richest AFS, and the highest OM (10.8\%), N (0.49\%), and EC (0.26 Âµs/cm) were found in the SBA system that has been converted recently from forests. In the SBA, the high values of pH, OM, N, EC, and CEC were result of cutting and burning of plant biomass during the land-clearing process. It is concluded that AFS harbor a great diversity of plant species and can improve soil fertility, which is essential for developing sustainable agroecosystems. Further research is required to understand the effect of variation in AFS age on the overall soil health indicators.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Organic farming is a comprehensive production management system that fosters and improves the health of agroecosystems, encompassing biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a crucial crop in organic farming systems, standing out as one of the most highly demanded organic products on the market. Among all crops, with potatoes, there is a very large yield gap between organic and conventional systems, attributable mainly to its intensive nutrient demands. The present review, considering the most relevant scientific literature worldwide, discusses the contemporary state of knowledge on crop nutrition and soil fertility management in organic potato crop production, analyzing the effects of animal manures, green manures, organic amendments, and biostimulants on organic potato tuber yield and quality. Overall, the main findings show a particular combination is needed to effectively maintain good soil fertility, satisfy the nutritional needs of the crop, and overcome the difference in potato yield between organic and conventional farming methods while meeting consumer demand. This combination entails using an animal manure or leguminous green manure with an organic soil amendment, and even better with a biofertilizer, such as a mycorrhizae-fungus-based one. It also emerged that more targeted studies are needed to select appropriate cultivars for organic potato farming systems to optimize this environmentally friendly production method.

(hereafter called AP) suitable for BEC up to 0.6 S mâˆ’1, at 23 stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network. Previous evaluations revealed inconsistent performance of both sensors in some clay soils using manufacturer-recommended calibrations in converting dielectric permittivity measurements to VWC. Here, we found that hourly values of BEC reached 0.6 S mâˆ’1 in high clay content soils and exceeded 2 S mâˆ’1 in high saline soils, and these high values of BEC were associated with poor performance and failures of both HP and AP sensors. Large values of BEC occurred in predominantly saturated soils where VWC values reached about 0.5 m3 mâˆ’3 for saline soils and about 0.7 m3 mâˆ’3 for clay soils, while low magnitudes of BEC were associated with low soil water content and seldomly saturated soils. Low hourly BEC values of less than 0.1 S mâˆ’1 were observed in wide variety of soil types, where sensor performance was typically excellent. The most influential factor on BEC was high soil water content conditions. Although dielectric permittivity measurements in estimating the soil water content were sensitive to BEC as some high clay content and high salinity soils increased BEC, the impact of large BEC on dielectric permittivity measurements was smaller in the well-drained top soil layers than in deep soil layers that remained near saturation. Soil temperature had only a small impact on BEC. With high clay content and high salinity, the specific area of clay minerals was also associated with the magnitude of BEC. Â© 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Metagenomes reveal the effect of crop rotation systems on phosphorus cycling functional genes and soil phosphorus availâ€“ability
VL  - 364
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of different cropping systems affects soil phosphorus (P) availability. Microbes play a main role in regulating soil P cycling. Currently, there is a knowledge gap on the effects of the long-term use of different crop rotation systems on microbial functional genes involved in P cycling on soil P availability. In this study, metagenomics was used to determine microbial functional genes involved in P cycling in a 12-year experiment that included three crop rotation systems: wheatâ€“maize rotation (WM), wheatâ€“cotton rotation (WC), and wheatâ€“soybean rotation (WS). WS had a significantly higher AP content than WC (37.3\%) and WM (41.5\%). Further analysis of the soil microbial population showed that WS mainly enriched the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes from the phylum to genus levels. For the P-cycling genes, WS significantly increased the P-cycling gene abundance of organic P mineralization (phoD, phnA, and phnP) compared with WC and WM. WC enhanced the microbial function of the Inorganic P solubilization genes gcd and gppa. WM enhanced the function of polyphosphate degradation, and the abundance of genes spoT and ppnK was significantly increased in WM soil compared with WC and WS soil. In addition, our structural equation model and network analysis showed that the organic P mineralization gene abundance had a significant effect on the available P content; the effect coefficients were 0.73, and the organic P mineralization genes phoD, phnA, and phnP, which were enriched in WS soil, were keystone genes in the process of increasing the soil-available P. Our results highlight the relationship between P cycle functions and cropping systems, which also has implications for enhancing P availability through the use of different crop systems in agricultural production.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - This study assessed the perception and use of digital applications for soil fertility management and conservation strategies among small-scale crop farmers in southwest Nigeria. A total of 376 farmers were randomly selected across the six southwest states. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The majority of the farmers relied on perception and other non-scientific approaches such as the appearance of weeds and performance of crops in the previous season to assess soil fertility. Only 1.1\% and 0.3\% of the farmers assessed soil fertility through soil tests and digital applications, respectively. Most farmers adopted bush fallowing and the use of inorganic fertilizers to improve soil fertility. Although 4.8\% of the farmers indicated that they had digital applications on their mobile phones, only 2.9\% claimed to have used these. More than half (56.4\%) of the farmers stated that a lack of awareness of the existence of digital applications and internet-enabled telephones were the reasons they have not been able to use digital applications. The majority of the farmers (97.3\%) indicated their willingness to embrace the use of new farm decision digital applications which could provide more information, especially on soil fertility, if introduced. More extensive services focusing on older, less literate farmers and farmers who hitherto did not belong to any farmersâ€™ association are advocated for in order to encourage the use of digital applications and soil fertility management and conservation practices.

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility in {Xinjiang} oasis cotton field based on big data techniques
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Assessing soil fertility through traditional methods has faced challenges due to the vast amount of meteorological data and the complexity of heterogeneous data. In this study, we address these challenges by employing the K-means algorithm for cluster analysis on soil fertility data and developing a novel K-means algorithm within the Hadoop framework. Our research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of soil fertility in the Shihezi region, particularly in the context of oasis cotton fields, leveraging big data techniques. The methodology involves utilizing soil nutrient data from 29 sampling points across six round fields in 2022. Through K-means clustering with varying K values, we determine that setting K to 3 yields optimal cluster effects, aligning closely with the actual soil fertility distribution. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our proposed K-means algorithm under the MapReduce framework with traditional serial K-means algorithms, demonstrating significant improvements in operational speed and successful completion of large-scale data computations. Our findings reveal that soil fertility in the Shihezi region can be classified into four distinct grades, providing valuable insights for agricultural practices and land management strategies. This classification contributes to a better understanding of soil resources in oasis cotton fields and facilitates informed decision-making processes for farmers and policymakers alike.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aimed to assess the influences of short-term straw return combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer on crop yield, soil properties, the bacterial community, and soil nitrogen cycling gene abundance in a riceâ€“rapeseed planting system. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a paddy field from 2019 to 2021. There were four treatments in the experiment: âˆ’Nâˆ’S, no N applied with no straw return; âˆ’N+S, no N applied with straw return; +Nâˆ’S, N applied with no straw return; and +N+S, N applied with straw return. The results showed that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer could increase crop yield and N use efficiency. N fertilizer application had a positive effect on Gemmatimonadota and Desulfobacterota abundance. Straw returning had a positive effect on Desulfobacterota and Proteobacteria abundance. N fertilization significantly increased the abundance of amoA-AOA, amoA-AOB, and nxrB in agricultural soils. Straw return and N fertilization were not conducive to denitrification. We conclude that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer in rice-growing areas not only increase crop yield and improve crop N uptake but also increase SOM, total N, and NH4+ and improve the soil microbial activity and N use efficiency.

TI  - The dynamics of soil nutrients in cold desert environments in the north-west {Himalayas} under a variety of forest types using geographical information system
VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - The amount of nutrients present in the soil is one of the most important factors that decide the overall productivity of an ecosystem as well as the variety of species that live there. The north-west Himalayas, which are home to a dry temperate and alpine forest of cold desert, served as the study location for the present research. The major purpose of the research was to investigate the dynamics of soil nutrients in connection to the structure and content of nine distinct kinds of forest ecosystems that may be found in the area. In each of the chosen forest types, the nutritional condition of the soil was analyzed for two distinct soil depths: the top layer (0â€“20 cm) and the bottom layer ({\textgreater} 20 cm) (21â€“40 cm). The different kinds of forest had pH readings that ranged anywhere from 4.81 to 6.82 in their soil. In a birch-rhododendron scrub forest, the levels of available soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, and zinc were found to be at their highest levels. Other soil properties such as organic carbon and electrical conductivity were also found to be at their highest levels in this type of forest as well. When it comes to the creation of forest plantations and artificial regeneration, there is a potential that forest managers may find the information on nutrients and biogeochemicals to be beneficial.

TI  - Development of soil water content retrieving method for irrigation agriculture areas using the red-edge band of {Gaofen}-6 satellite
VL  - 303
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content (SWC) is an essential index that reflects water conditions in the soil surface during drought, and changes in SWC are critical in guiding agricultural irrigation management. Remote sensing is a crucial means of monitoring SWC, and the red and near-infrared bands of optical remote sensing data are often used to monitor SWC through remote sensing retrieval. With the development of remote sensing technology, red-edge band has also been used to retrieve SWC. It exhibits higher sensitivity to changes in vegetation and SWC, relatively more precise differentiation between vegetation and soil, and more accurate SWC detection. However, there has been relatively little research regarding the use of the red-edge band for retrieving SWC. In this study, we developed a novel method, based on the principle of spectral space and the calculation of modified perpendicular drought index, to calculate the soil water index using the red-edge band of the Gaofen-6 (GF-6) satellite by comparing the retrieval accuracy of GF-6 using different combinations of red, near-infrared, and red-edge bands. Based on the measured SWC in the Shijin Irrigation District of Hebei Province, an SWC retrieval model was established using linear regression. Moreover, the new method was used to retrieve SWC from GF-6 and Sentinel-2 with the same central wavelength, and the reliability of the new method was compared and analyzed. The results revealed that the combination of red band and red-edge band 2 with a central wavelength of 0.74 Î¼m substantial. improved the retrieval accuracy of SWC. Our study provides a new method for retrieving SWC using optical remote sensing, which can effectively improve retrieval accuracy and provide data support for agricultural irrigation monitoring and water management.

AB  - [Purpose] This study aims to investigate the impacts of three slope restoration techniques, namely, soil spray sowing, vegetation fiber, and vegetation concrete, on soil fertility, pH, and organic matter content during the summer drought period. The study also aims to explore the advantages of these three different restoration techniques, providing a basis for slope restoration in the Northeast Jiangxi region. [Methods] The study used experimental slopes established with three different restoration techniques: soil spray sowing, vegetation fiber, and vegetation concrete. Soil samples were collected during the rainy season in July 2022 and the drought season in September 2022. The changes in hydrolyzable nitrogen, available potassium, available phosphorus content, pH, and organic matter in the soil after restoration were comprehensively investigated. The study relies on the Qi-Wu expressway, and all the experiments are set on the slopes on both sides of the expressway. [Results]â‘ For the soil restored using soil spray sowing during the drought season, the content of hydrolyzable nitrogen and available potassium was higher than that of the original soil, while the content of available phosphorus significantly decreased. The pH changed from acidic to weakly alkaline. â‘¡For the soil restored using vegetation fiber during the drought season, although the content of available phosphorus increased, it was still relatively low. The content of available potassium decreased, but the total amount remained high. The content of hydrolyzable nitrogen was high and showed an increasing trend. The pH slightly decreased from weakly acidic to acidic. â‘¢For the soil restored using vegetation concrete during the drought season, the content of hydrolyzable nitrogen, available potassium, and available phosphorus was high and showed an increasing trend. The pH slightly decreased, but it remained weakly alkaline before and after the drought. [Conclusion] Soil spray sowing, vegetation fiber, and vegetation concrete, all three restoration techniques, could demonstrate good performance during the drought period in the Northeastern Jiangxi region. In terms of their overall performance, the ranking from strong to weak is as follows: vegetation concrete {\textgreater} vegetation fiber {\textgreater} soil spray sowing. Soil spray sowing, as the most convenient and cost-effective slope restoration technique, could in the future incorporate additives that can improve local soil properties according to different regional characteristics. Vegetation fiber not only needs to improve soil acidity-alkalinity but should also appropriately incorporate phosphorus-containing additives. Vegetation concrete needs to address the issue of reducing soil acidity-alkalinity after restoration in the future. Â© 2024 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important component of the hydrologic cycle and ecosystem functioning, and it has a significant impact on agricultural production, climate change and natural disasters. Despite the availability of machine-learning techniques for estimating soil moisture from high-resolution remote-sensing imagery, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and optical remote sensing, comprehensive comparative studies of these techniques remain limited. This paper addresses this gap by systematically comparing the performance of four tree-based ensemble-learning models (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and category boosting (CatBoost)) and three deep-learning models (deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)) in terms of soil moisture estimation. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of four different stacking methods for model fusion, an approach that is relatively novel in this context. Moreover, Sentinel-1 C-band dual-polarization SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, as well as NASADEM and geographical code and temporal code features, are used as input variables to retrieve the soil moisture in the ShanDian River Basin in China. Our findings reveal that the tree-based ensemble-learning models outperform the deep-learning models, with LightGBM being the best individual model, while the stacking approach can further enhance the accuracy and robustness of soil moisture estimation. Moreover, the stacking all boosting classes ensemble-learning model (SABM), which integrates only boosting-type models, demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness in soil moisture estimation. The SHAP value analysis reveals that ensemble learning can utilize more complex features than deep learning. This study provides an effective method for retrieving soil moisture using machine-learning and high-resolution remote-sensing data, demonstrating the application value of SAR data and high-resolution optical remote-sensing data in soil moisture monitoring.

VL  - 57
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract: Efficient utilization of agricultural soil phosphorus (P) and mitigation of loss risks necessitate a precise evaluation of soil P storage capacity (SPSC). This study compared the effectiveness of four soil test P methods (Oxalate, Bray, Olsen, and Mehlich-1) to accurately estimate SPSC and simplify P loss risk assessment of soils located in a typical red soil in the Sunjia Watershed, Yingtan, Jiangxi Province, China. The extraction efficiencies of these methods for Fe, Al, P, and P saturation ratio (PSR) were compared, and conversion equations between SPSCOx (extracted using Oxalate) and soil test P (Bray, Olsen, and Mehlich-1) were derived through fitting analysis. The results underscored Oxalate as the optimal extractant for gauging P loss risk in red soils. Structural equation modeling (SEM) unveiled the substantial impact of amorphous iron-aluminum oxides (Feo, Alo) on SPSC, with Feo exerting a more pronounced influence than Alo. Among soil physicochemical properties, total carbon emerged as the most influential, and a strong interaction was noted between the physicochemical properties and Feo and Alo. The study delineated three crucial P concentration ranges for practical P management in red soils. When Bray-P {\textless} 48.2 mg kgâ€“1, the soil acted as a P sink with no P loss risk, allowing for continued P application to augment crop yield. Conversely, within 48.2 mg kgâ€“1 {\textless} Bray-P â‰¤ 55.2 mg kgâ€“1, the soil attained its maximum secure P capacity; further P application significantly escalated the peril of P loss. Subsequently, when Bray-P {\textgreater} 55.2 mg kgâ€“1, the soil turns into a source of P release. This signifies an escalated risk of P loss, demanding the immediate implementation of environmental protective measures. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

AB  - This study focuses on investigating the accuracy of the empirical equations proposed by the manufacturing company for the widely used TEROS 10 and TEROS 12 sensors. Specifically, the study examines whether the raw - unprocessed - measurements provided by the two sensors lead to reliable predictions of soil moisture and electrical conductivity values when these particular empirical equations are utilized. For this purpose, a prototype setup was developed, incorporating a lowcost microcontroller along with auxiliary power supply and data acquisition circuits for the sensors. The results highlight the need for specific calibration of the sensors for each soil type and salinity level. Additionally, the behaviour of the sensors operating at low frequency (70 MHz) under increasing salinity conditions is contrary to expectations. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

TI  - Evaluation of soil fertility index in organic, semi-organic, and conventional rice field management systems
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Rice farming in Madiun Regency implements three different management systems, that is organic, semi-organic, and conventional. The different implementation of these rice field management systems impacts soil fertility index and rice productivity. This purpose of this research was to know the effect of rice field management systems on soil fertility index and rice productivity in the Madiun Regency. The research uses an explorative descriptive qualitative method with a survey approach. Soil samples were taken using a random sampling method and 3 types of soil management systems (conventional, semi-organic and organic), and rice production samples were taken using an estimation method. The research results show that the soil fertility index ranges from 0.78 to 0.82, which is high. The highest soil fertility index is in the semi-organic management system and the lowest is in the organic management. The management system of semi-organic gave a response to the highest rice production of 6.89 tons/ha. Management system of semi-organic is a better management for increasing and maintaining soil fertility and crop production than conventional or organic. Farming activities results show that organic management systems increase the highest income, increasing 115.58\% and 53.30\% in semi-organic compared to conventional. The rice field management system has the effect of increasing the worm population density with the highest in the organic system, namely 4.19 individuals m-2. The Pontoscolex worm type dominates the three management systems. There is a correlation between organic matter content and earthworms. Â© 2024 Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil fertility in mixed crop-livestock farming systems of {Punjab}, {Pakistan}: {The} role of institutional factors and sustainable land management practices
VL  - 218
SN  - NA
AB  - CONTEXT: Soil salinization is a significant environmental challenge prevalent in arid and semi-arid regions, causing adverse effects on crop yields and jeopardizing household food security. Previous research has examined the influence of institutional dynamics and the adoption of sustainable land management practices in bolstering agricultural output, and some have investigated the interplay among socioeconomic determinants, institutional frameworks, and the uptake of climate-resilient and sustainable methodologies, or the association between soil health and agricultural productivity. Yet, there has been a lack of studies that considered this relationship altogether and their role in enhancing soil fertility. OBJECTIVE: We investigate the relationship among socioeconomic and institutional factors, adoption of sustainable land management practices, and the resulting changes in soil fertility between 2016 and 2019 within the context of mixed crop-livestock farms in the three irrigated agroecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan. A household survey was conducted in 2019 to complement soil attributes data collected by the Government of Punjab in 2016. Households that implemented sustainable land management practices between 2016 and 2019 were analysed to investigate the effect of various factors on soil fertility, including the adoption of sustainable land management practices and their influence on soil fertility dynamics. METHODS: A structural equation model was employed to examine the relationship among exogenous variables, moderating variables, and endogenous variables, to explain their collective influence on soil fertility between the two periods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The key findings highlight the significant role of institutional factors, including access to formal information channels such as extension services, demonstration trials, and credit facilities, alongside secure land rights, in predicting the adoption of sustainable land management practices such as gypsum application, laser land leveling, farmyard manuring, and agroforestry. Furthermore, specific SLM practices, particularly agroforestry featuring intercropping with Acacia spp. and farmyard manure application, exhibited positive impacts on change in soil organic matter, albeit with agroforestry showing a negative influence on soil phosphorus levels. The adoption of gypsum and LLL displayed positive effects on soil phosphorus levels over time, contrasting with LLL's adverse impact on soil organic matter. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that soil fertility benefits from policies enacted through public-private partnerships that lead to improved access to sustainable land management information, reduced credit barriers, establishment of local soil testing facilities, and expedited land entitlement processes. These findings highlight the critical role of collaborative partnerships and institutional arrangements in enhancing agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. Â© 2024 The Authors

TI  - Soil nutrient dynamics, harvest residue management and soil organic matter conservation for the sustainability of black wattle production systems in subtropical soils: a review
VL  - 55
SN  - NA
AB  - Black wattle is a tree native to Australia and commercially planted in South Africa and Brazil. Replacement of exported nutrients by wood and bark harvesting, associated with the maintenance of harvest residues, increases productivity, thus maintaining production sustainability. Here, we review recent advances in soil nutrient dynamics, harvest residue management (HRM), and soil organic matter in black wattle plantations. Over the 7â€“11-year cycle of black wattle, N is the most exported macronutrient (458â€“1509 kg haâˆ’ 1), followed by K (200â€“766 kg haâˆ’ 1), Ca (270â€“717 kg haâˆ’ 1), Mg (62â€“128 kg haâˆ’ 1), S (29â€“57 kg haâˆ’ 1) and P (16â€“40 kg haâˆ’ 1). The average increase in bark yield to 20 kg P haâˆ’ 1 applications on sandy soils was 2.7â€“2.9 t haâˆ’ 1 and on clay soils from 2.8 to 8.7 t haâˆ’ 1. Sandy soils with low K are more responsive to fertilizer, and rates must consider the K content and cation exchange capacity. Ca and Mg addition responses are more likely when in the topsoil they are in low concentrations ({\textless} 0.75 and 0.41 cmolc dmâˆ’ 3, respectively). Micronutrient fertilization reduces the occurrence of gummosis caused by Phytophthora spp, and B deficiency is the most common and can be supplied by fertilization or foliar application (1 g B Lâˆ’ 1). Few studies have evaluated the impact of black wattle HRM on soil organic matter (SOM) and its effects on production. However, conserving SOM should be considered an essential practice for the sustainability of black wattle production. Â© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) is a key geophysical variable that enables a better understanding of the Earth's hydrological processes. Missions like Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) have been the primary sources of SM estimations for years. The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission, planned to launch in 2024, will bring L-band and S-band SAR measurements that will be used for SM estimation. Consequently, investigations to link SMAP with NISAR to produce accurate SM retrievals at improved spatial resolutions will be a focus to many research initiatives. This investigation aims to set the basis to use polarimetric Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) products to enhance the temporal resolution of NISAR's L-band SAR data through its typical 12-day period. As a proof of concept, we model SMAP radar backscatter measurements from SMAP-Reflectometry (SMAP-R) measurements, using the 3 months of data collected by the SMAP radar while it was operational. The model is based on the sensitivity of polarimetric GNSS-R to roughness, vegetation, and SM, as well as on the complementary sensitivity existing between forward and backward scatter. Different regression models are implemented using single-, dual-, and full-polarization GNSS-R measurements synthetized from SMAP-R data. This study highlights the importance of the new constellations of polarimetric GNSS-R being built and shows how those frequent measurements can serve L-band SAR missions to improve their time resolution.

TI  - Evaluation of {Soil} {Potassium} {Using} {Miniaturized} {Electrochemical} {Sensors
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - Farmers aim to increase the yield of their crops by reducing their expenses. This prompts farmers to resort to smart farming practices. These practices facilitate the measurement and detection of nutrients in soil to maximize harvest with a low-cost sensor employing electrochemical and optical techniques. Potassium is a crucial macronutrient for the growth of plants. The excess or need for potassium in the soil can pose a risk to plants and the environment. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct soil monitoring to determine the quantity of soil fertilizer. ISFETs are among the most affordable and miniaturized sensors and are specific to one target ion. Although it is not time-consuming and requires an immediate response, the ISFET requires special calibration and sample preparation. This study tested ISFET on Moroccan soil potassium using a new technique of minimal sample preparation without needing a laboratory machine to extract soil using distilled water. The results indicate that the microsensor ISFET provided accurate results on solutions prepared in the laboratory with a correlation factor of 90\%, and RÂ² greater than 80\% when estimating potassium levels in soil extracts. ISFET can therefore be used as an alternative method for potassium estimation. Â© 2024, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE). All rights reserved.

VL  - 494
SN  - NA
AB  - The application of ensemble data mining methods in assessing soil fertility and the use of methods such as random forest, gradient boosting and bagging to determine the level of soil fertility are examined in the article. Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning models to improve the accuracy and stability of estimates. These methods consider various factors, including soil chemistry, climatic conditions, and historical crop yield data. The study also examines the application of the decision tree algorithm and such methods as random forest and bagging to estimate soil fertility. Performance results of these methods are provided using precision, recall, and F1-measure metrics. The results obtained show the high performance of ensemble methods in the task of classifying soil fertility levels. They have important implications for agricultural farms and research organizations that are working to improve soil management and increase crop yields. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

TI  - Microwave soil moisture products in {North} {China} {Plain} based on triple collocation method applicability evaluation
VL  - 13170
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave remote sensing inversion of soil moisture (SM) products has gained increasing prominence in agricultural, meteorological, hydrological, and other research fields, and analyzing the regional applicability of microwave remote sensing SM data is a crucial prerequisite for their effective utilization. In order to assess the accuracy and applicability of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 remote sensing SM products in the North China Plain, we employed MERRA2 simulated SM as reference data, the triple collocation (TC) method was utilized to compare and evaluate the daily SM data obtained from remote sensing products in the region. The results of the TC analysis indicate that SMAP SM exhibited superior performance in the North China Plain. The majority of errors had a standard deviation of less than 0.023 m3 / m3, and the cumulative frequency of errors less than 0.027 m3 / m3 approached 1, surpassing ASCAT and AMSR2 overall. Additionally, SMAP exhibited the lowest deviation and root mean square error. The median correlation coefficient was highest for SMAP, followed by AMSR2 and ASCAT. Similarly, the median deviation and root mean square error were lowest for SMAP. The verification results of the evaluation index align with the TC findings. The error standard deviation of SMAP demonstrates the best performance across various land use types. The land use types with the best quality of SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2 are cultivated land and grassland (low vegetation coverage area), among which ASCAT is better than AMSR2 in cultivated land and grassland. The error of urban construction land is the largest. This study aims to provide a scientific reference for enhancing the inversion algorithm and facilitating the extensive application of data products, and lay the foundation for future research such as im-proving product resolution and drought monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of five soil nutrient extraction methods for practical assessment of phosphorus and potassium availability for tomato ({Solanum} lycopersicum) fertilization in {Andisols}-{Garut}, {Indonesia
VL  - 77
SN  - NA
AB  - Phosphorus and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth and development. Plants will achieve optimum biomass and production if phosphorus and potassium needs are met through fertilization. Determining the availability of phosphorus and potassium in the soil is essential because it is related to decisions on phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rate recommendations. In this study, we evaluated five common phosphorus and potassium extraction methods by correlating the indicated soil nutrient levels to the relative biomass dry weight of tomato plants. The phosphorus and potassium extraction methods used were Mehlich-1, Bray-1, Morgan-Wolf, Ammonium acetate, and HCl-25\%. Mean Root Error (MRE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to determine the precision of the linear regression equation model in predicting the relationship between phosphorus and potassium soil extraction methods and the relative biomass dry weight of tomato plants. The correlation of the soil extraction methods used in Andisols with the relative biomass dry weight of tomato was highly significant and very strong (r?{\textgreater} 0.75) suggesting that Bray-1 was the best soil-phosphorus extraction method (Pr = 0.88; PMRE = 0.10; PRMSE = 4.44), while HCl-25\% was the most suitable for soil-potassium extraction (Kr = 0.90; KMRE = 0.05; KRMSE = 2.95). The results of the two extraction methods will be used to determine the dosage of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers (nutrient sufficiency approach) for tomato plants grown in Andisols.

TI  - Development of modified maize stover for enhancing soil nutrients and functional microbes: {Application} of {NPK}-enriched techniques
VL  - 209
SN  - NA
AB  - Returning maize stover (MS) to the soil can effectively enhance fertility by introducing organic matter. However, the slow degradation and nutrient deficiencies in MS potentially undermine soil quality. This study developed a method to synthesize NPK-enriched MS with the aim of improving soil nutrients and microbial diversity, as demonstrated in preliminary field trials. Under optimal conditions (8\% urea, 4\% KOH, and 8 freeze-thaw cycles), N and K were successfully grafted onto MS, forming MS-UK. This resulted in increased N and K content by 17.57\% and 4.49\%, respectively. The increase was due to urea interacting with fragmented lignin benzene rings to form C-N bonds, and KOH acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor to form C-K bonds. Following phosphorus adsorption with a K2HPO4 solution, MS-UK achieved a near-theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of 21.34 mg gâˆ’1, forming MS-UK-P. In field experiments, MS-UK-P showed a 29.11\% higher degradation rate compared to unmodified MS. Notably, the MS-UK-P treatment group exhibited significant increases in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the availability of N, P, and K contents compared to the unmodified MS group, with SOC levels rising by 1.74 g kgâˆ’1, and N, P, and K contents increasing by 6.37 mg kgâˆ’1, 15.59 mg kgâˆ’1, and 18.7 mg kgâˆ’1, respectively. Furthermore, MS-UK-P promoted the growth of nitrogen and carbon-fixing microorganisms, including Bradyrhizobium, Gemmatimonadaceae, and Mycobacterium. This study highlights the urea-KOH and K2HPO4 modification as a novel and effective approach for converting MS into nutrient-rich fertilizer, offering new opportunities for enhancing the utilization of MS and similar agricultural residues to improve soil quality.

TI  - A {Multi}-source {Satellite} {Soil} {Moisture} {Fusion} {Method} {Considering} the {Influence} of {Geographic} and {Climatic} {Factors
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing technology shows huge advantages in obtaining large-scale, high spatio-temporal resolution soil moisture (SM) datasets. However, the high variability across different remote sensing SM datasets induced by different retrieval algorithms and different radiative transfer models used in these algorithms presents a considerable challenge to get the right choice in different applications. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a comprehensive multi-source SM fusion framework based on machine learning models. This framework uncovers intrinsic connections between multi-source SM datasets and various geographic and climatic factors, enhancing the quality of multi-source SM datasets and mitigating data uncertainties. The framework consists of two critical processes: firstly, the identification of key environmental factors closely related to SM spatio-temporal dynamics, and secondly, the rational stratification and sampling of data samples across the whole area. A stratified k-fold cross-validation method was employed to train and validate the machine learning models. We evaluated the fusion dataset accuracy based on 594 ground-observed SM stations. Results demonstrated improved performance of the fusion framework after incorporating geographic and climatic information. The simulation performance hierarchy was observed as follows: Fusion of multi-source SM datasets and geographic-climatic environmental factors (median R2 âˆˆ [0.32,0.52]) {\textgreater} Fusion considering only multi-source soil moisture datasets (median R2 âˆˆ [0.23,0.36]) {\textgreater} Fusion considering only geographic-climatic environmental factors (median R2 âˆˆ [0.11,0.19]). Additionally, the fusion datasets exhibited higher accuracy than single satellite/reanalysis SM datasets. The fusion dataset I, constructed from separate watersheds (median CC: 0.69-0.82, median RMSE: 0.063-0.067m3/m3), outperformed fusion dataset II, constructed from the whole area (median CC: 0.67-0.78, median RMSE: 0.071-0.089m3/m3). The high-quality SM dataset obtained through this fusion approach seamlessly integrates information from multi-sources SM datasets, groundbased SM observations, and geographic-climatic environmental factors. This integration is poised to enhance applications in regional hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and meteorology. Â© 2024 IEEE.

VL  - 873
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive design and implementation of a Sunward Solar-Powered Wireless Soil Moisture Sensor, which combines cutting-edge technology to enable energy-efficient soil moisture measurement and wireless data transmission. The proposed sensor system employs capacitance-based soil moisture measurement principles and incorporates innovative design elements to reduce costs and simplify installation. It also integrates solar power technology to ensure autonomous and sustainable operation. The core components of the system include a microcontroller (MSP430F149), a Wireless Transceiver Unit (nRF905), a Soil Moisture Sensor Unit with annular and conical electrodes, and a servo motor-based solar panel module for optimal solar energy capture. The sensor's power consumption is meticulously analyzed, and its energy requirements are met by a combination of solar panels and rechargeable batteries. The design of the Sunward Solar Panel Module, featuring a spherical servo motor, is a highlight of this system. The servo motor ensures precise tracking of the sun's position, optimizing solar panel orientation for maximum energy generation. Four Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs) strategically placed on the solar panel aid in this tracking process. Through this innovative system, real-time soil moisture data can be collected and wirelessly transmitted over long distances, making it a valuable tool for applications in agriculture and environmental monitoring. The paper also discusses the dimensions and efficiency of the solar panel, ensuring that it meets the energy needs of the sensor. It achieves the main objective of this research, that is, not only in day time when sun is with more intensity but also in the low-intensity times like morning and evenings, the proposed design exhibits better results.

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture of a high {Andean} wetland ecosystem ({Bofedal}) with geo-radar data and {In}-{Situ} measurements, {Ayacucho} - {Peru
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - High Andean ecosystems within microbasins serve as crucial areas for water recharge, containing both surface and subsurface moisture. However, these ecosystems are currently under threat due to overgrazing, degradation, and the impacts of climate change. The objective is to validate the subsoil moisture of bofedal estimated using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data in comparison to in-situ measurements obtained with a soil moisture meter (SMM) in the Apacheta microbasin of the Ayacucho region. The validation method involves comparing soil moisture values obtained with the SMM, with the estimated dielectric permittivity (DP) values from GPR surveys along four transects (T) in a bofedal. Reflected wave amplitude data are converted to DP values to identify water pockets (70{\textless}DP{\textless}81) and saturated soil moisture (10{\textless}DP{\textless}40). An analysis of the determination coefficient R2 and the Kappa index (Îº) was conducted between both groups of bofedal subsoil moisture data along the four surveyed transects at depths ranging from 0 to 24 cm that contain water and saturated moisture. T1 contains a volume of 1,16m3 (47.85 \%), T2 has 0.98m3 (46.6 \%), T3 lacks water (40.8 \%), and T4 holds 0.63m3 (31.45 \%). The correlation of DP data with SMM for T1 (R2=0.801), T2 (R2=0.949), T3 (R2=0.837) y T4 (R2=0.842) implies that the SMM measurements significantly explain the estimated DP. Moreover, the kappa test demonstrated good agreement reliability between both observations made with GPR and SMM, with Îº=0.763;[95\%CI:0.471âˆ’1.055], indicating that the GPR method for measuring subsoil moisture is acceptable with an 87.5\% confidence level.

AB  - The soil fertility of rice fields is closely related to rice crop production. The research aims to identify soil fertility under different rice field farming systems, find the key factor of soil fertility, and recommend strategies to improve soil fertility based on the key factor. The research was conducted in Nguntoronadi District, Indonesia, on conventional, semi-organic, and organic rice fields. The research was an exploratory descriptive survey through a field survey approach and soil chemistry and physics analysis. Soil sampling was conducted in 12 Land Map Units (LMUs) with three replicates using purposive sampling methods. Observation indicators include soil pH, organic C, total N, C/N ratio, available P, available K, exchangeable Ca, exchangeable Mg, Cation Exchangeable Capacity (CEC), Base Saturation (BS), Aluminum saturation, soil texture, and worm population density representing soil chemical, physical, and biological properties. Soil fertility is determined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and scoring based on the category. The research results show that the level of soil fertility under various rice field farming systems was included in the moderate with ranges of 0.53-0.70, and organic farming has the highest soil fertility. The key factors of soil fertility include pH, organic C, available P, available K, Ca-dd, CEC, and Aluminum saturation. The appropriate management direction is the addition of organic fertilizer in the planting period. Â© 2024, Centenary University. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting {Cd} accumulation in rice and identifying nonlinear effects of soil nutrient elements based on machine learning methods
VL  - 912
SN  - NA
AB  - The spatial mismatch of Cd content in soil and rice causes difficulties in environmental management for paddy soil. To investigate the influence of soil environment on the accumulation of Cd in rice grain, we conducted a paired field sampling in the middle of the Xiangjiang River basin, examining the relationships between soil properties, soil nutrient elements, Cd content, plant uptake factor (PUFCd), and translocation factors in different rice organs (root, shoot, and grain). The total soil Cd (CdT) and available Cd (CdA) contents and PUFCd showed large spatial variability with ranges of 0.31â€“6.19 mg/kg, 0.03â€“3.07 mg/kg, and 0.02â€“3.51, respectively. Soil pH, CdT, CdA, and the contents of soil nutrient elements (Mg, Mn, Ca, P, Si, and B) were linearly correlated with grain Cd content (Cdg) and PUFCd. The decision tree analysis identified nonlinear effects of Si, Zn and Fe on rice Cd accumulation, which suggested that low Si and high Zn led to high Cdg, and low Si and Fe caused high PUFCd. Using the soil nutrient elements as predictor variables, random forest models successfully predicted the Cdg and PUFCd and performed better than multiple linear regressions. It suggested the impacts of soil nutrient elements on rice Cd accumulation should receive more attention. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Variation in soil penetration resistance as a function of soil moisture under crop management systems
VL  - 55
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of this study was to monitor the temporal variation in penetration resistance (PR) after soil saturation under different management systems in three areas of the Cerrado biome: two in no-till systems (NT with 3 and 10 years of implementation) and one of crop-livestock integration (CL with 9 years of implementation) with soybean/forage succession. Four transects were delimited in each area. The delimited area was saturated and the PR measurements were performed daily for 11 days at 10 transect points, up to 0.40 m of depth. Soil moisture was determined with PR measurements, soil hydraulic conductivity, and organic carbon. PR values were more significant in the 0.10 - 0.20 m layer than in the 0.0 - 0.10 and 0.20 - 0.40 m layers. The NT-3 area showed a lower PR value (1.65 MPa) than the area under NT-10 and CL-9, with 2.48 and 2.69 MPa, respectively. Thus, critical soil moisture values, that is, soil moisture values most susceptible to soil compaction were determined. Thus, in the NT-3 area, the critical moisture was 0.20 kg kgâˆ’1, in the NT-10, ranged from 0.19 - 0.20 kg kgâˆ’1, and in the CL-9, between 0.23 and 0.20 kg kgâˆ’1. Monitoring soil moisture can prevent management operations from restricting root growth. Â© (2024), (Universidade Federal do Ceara). All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 235
SN  - NA
AB  - At the heart of India's livelihood lies agriculture, a foundational and ever-evolving sector. The realm of agriculture faces modern challenges, encompassing unpredictable climate fluctuations, insufficient irrigation infrastructure, and erratic weather conditions. Amidst these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a valuable tool for evaluating soil fertility and Crop assessment in agriculture. Ensemble machine learning methodologies have garnered attention for their potential to enhance predictive capabilities. These techniques involve constructing meta-classifiers that collectively contribute to improved predictive accuracy. This paper centers on the analysis of soil data acquired from testing laboratories, to predict fertility based on a comprehensive dataset. The study employs prominent ensemble machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on boosting techniques, to elevate predictive accuracy and ensure heightened consistency. The assessment of soil fertility categories involved the examination of 12 carefully chosen attributes. Diverse soil parameters were measured to facilitate the prediction of soil fertility levels. The outcomes of the experimentation revealed that the application of the boosting technique using the Xgboost algorithm yielded superior accuracy compared to alternative ensemble classifiers, achieving a remarkable 96\% accuracy rate.

TI  - Tarping and mulching effects on crop yields, profitability, and soil nutrients in a continuous no-till organic vegetable production system
VL  - 39
SN  - NA
AB  - Small-scale organic vegetable farms need strategies to overcome yield, labor, and economic challenges in transitioning to reduced and no-till practices. However, the production tradeoffs associated with different scale-appropriate management practices are not well documented for these operations. We evaluated crop yields, labor, profitability, and soil nutrients over four continuous years of management in Freeville, NY. Cabbage (Y1 and Y3) and winter squash (Y2 and Y4) were managed in permanent beds under four contrasting tillage systems: conventional rototilling to 20 cm depth (CT), shallow rototilling to 10 cm (ST), no-till (NT), and no-till with tarping (NTT), in which an impermeable, black polyethylene tarp was applied to the soil surface between crops. Within each tillage treatment, we compared three mulching systems: rye mulch (RM), compost mulch (CM), and no mulch (NM), where mulches were applied annually to each crop. Crop yields did not vary by tillage, except in RM, where yields were highest in CT and reduced in ST and NT over four years. Mulch treatments were a significant driver of crop yields. When compared to NM, RM reduced crop yields in the first two years and CM increased yields after the first year. Overall, RM systems had the lowest net returns and CM returns were equivalent to NM despite greater yields. No-till consistently required the greatest pre-harvest labor investment, up to two times greater than tilled systems with NM, and the lowest net returns. Labor requirements for NTT were greater than CT but up to 41\% lower than NT, and profitability was equivalent to CT. Shallow tillage performed similar to CT across yield, labor, and profitability measures, except when combined with the use of RM. Compost mulching led to dramatic changes in soil properties after four years, including a 49\% increase in total soil carbon, a 31\% increase in total soil nitrogen, and a 497\% increase in extractable phosphorus. Small farms adopting NT practices should: 1) consider the potential tradeoffs associated with annually applied organic mulches, and 2) integrate tarping to increase the profitability of NT over consecutive production years.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Successional agroforestry systems have the capacity to increase soil fertility and restore degraded ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of agroforestry systems, at different stages of ecological succession, on the dynamics of chemical and physical soil fertility attributes in the Brazil South region. Soil samples were collected under five different conditions: (i) Control (T) = initial system (without agroforestry); (ii) SAF1 = agroforestry with 1 year of development; (iii) SAF3 = agroforestry with 3 years of development; (iv) SAF7 = agroforestry with 7 years of development; and (v) reference system (naturally regenerating forest with 30 years). Subsequently, determinations/calculations were carried out for chemical attributes/parameters (exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, P, Al3+, H+, sum of bases, effective and potential cation exchange capacity, cation exchange saturation with bases and Al3+), physical attributes (soil bulk density, particle density, total porosity, and moisture), and soil physicochemical properties (pH H2O, pH in saline solutions, and SMP method), as well as chemical element stocks were calculated based on soil mass in each sampled layer. Results showed an increase in pH, total porosity, and nutrient stocks with the systems' development time, accompanied by a decrease in acidity components. The increase in soil fertility is directly related to the increase in soil organic matter content. Â© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

SN  - NA
AB  - With the escalating population, modernization and intensification of agriculture, secondary salinization of soil has emerged as a significant challenge. The development of technologies aimed at improving salinized land and enhancing soil fertility holds paramount importance in the agricultural development process. However, a notable gap exists in periodic summary and analysis research in this field. To address this gap, this review employs a visual bibliometric research method. Drawing from the literature on salinized land improvement and soil fertility enhancement, indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection from 1990 to 2022, we aim to gain insights into the development trends of research field. Utilizing the CiteSpace analysis software, we delve into the patterns and trends in salinized land improvement and soil fertility enhancement. The results reveal a steady rise in publication and citation volumes, with a literature publication growth rate of 122\%. The upward trend reflects the increasing urgency and significance of this research area. Global population growth, coupled with water resource shortages, creates a pressing need for further advancements in agricultural soil restoration and improvement techniques. Soil degradation, which contributes to the depletion of soil organic carbon stocks, poses a significant threat to the sustainability of agricultural systems. As a result, achieving carbon sequestration, emission reduction, and soil fertility enhancement has become a shared objective among researchers. International cooperation and exchange play a pivotal role in driving scientific research in this field. Over the past few decades, the research focus has shifted from agricultural management and planting systems, conservation tillage, soil amendment application, and soil microbial diversity to ecological effects and climate change. Current research hotspots primarily concentrate on the impact of amendments on soil fertility, soil organic carbon stocks, soil physical and chemical properties, and biophysical processes in diverse agricultural and forestry systems. By understanding these trends and hotspots, we can gain valuable insights into the current state of research and identify potential areas for future exploration. This research can contribute to the development of more effective and sustainable soil fertility enhancement techniques, ultimately promoting agricultural sustainability and environmental preservation.

TI  - Inversion of soil moisture based on improved change detection method using {Sentinel}-{1A} and {MODIS} time-series data
VL  - 13170
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential soil parameter affecting energy transfer and surface heat exchange. Accurately acquiring surface soil moisture is important for guiding agricultural production, understanding the global water cycle, and studying climate change. This paper conducted an inversion study of soil moisture in the Shandian River Basin based on the change detection method (CD) using Sentinel-1A and MODIS time series data. It was found that the traditional CD has a mismatch problem between the amount of change in soil moisture and the amount of change in radar backscattering coefficient, which reduces the accuracy of soil moisture inversion. This paper proposes an improved CD that corrects for soil moisture variations and radar backscattering coefficient variations using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) piecewise function. Compared with the traditional CD and the Alpha model, the improved CD proposed in this paper has better applicability in the vegetation cover area and improves the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.813, a coefficient of determination of 0.645, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046 cm3 /cm3. The improved CD does not require complex parameters and has the potential for large-scale application. Using the improved CD to invert soil moisture, the inversion of soil moisture value can capture the changing trend of measured soil moisture value in a time series. Â© 2024 SPIE.

AB  - In order to solve the problems of low correlation between variable fertilizer application system and soil nutrient content detection and insufficient real-time performance, a variable fertilizer application system based on real-time soil nutrient content detection was developed. This paper describes the structure, working principle and design of key components of the soil information acquisition and fertilizer application system. It includes the simulation and analysis of fertilizer application using the discrete element method and the selection of curved blade fertilizer application discs. The system uses STM32F429IGT6 microcontroller and ROS higher-level computer for decision making. The device detects soil nutrients in real time, adjusts the fertilizer motor speed accordingly, and runs autonomously along the planned path. The decision coefficient R2 between the fertilizer application rate and the speed of the fertilizer application wheel is not less than 0.97, and the relative error between the actual fertilizer application rate and the theoretical fertilizer application rate is up to 5.91\%, with the maximum value of the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10.18\%. The indoor bench test shows that the relative error between the actual fertilizer application rate and the target fertilizer application rate within a single operating grid is up to 6.2\%, with the maximum value of CV being 6.64\%. The field test in the orchard showed that the maximum relative error between the actual fertilizer application and the target fertilizer application in a single operation grid was 6.3\%, and the maximum value of CV was 12.34\%, and the fertilizer application was completed in the operation grid, which demonstrated that the device was able to realize real-time and accurate variable fertilizer application according to the soil nutrient information.

TI  - Deep residual network for soil nutrient assessment using optical sensors
VL  - 187
SN  - NA
AB  - Background: Farmers need information regarding soil fertility at every location of their fields to attain a higher level of precision in nutrient management. Nonetheless, the acquisition and processing of soil samples are labor-intensive and time-utilizing, and the related cost remains high-priced to farmers. Artificial intelligence is the most speedily growing area combined into approximately all aspects of human life. Soil macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) have a significant role in precision agriculture. There is a huge need for powerful and rapid measurement systems to measure accurately the macronutrients in the soil for optimal crop productivity, especially in site-specific crop management system, where the application of fertilizer can be regulated spatially with respect to crop demand. Nevertheless, it can present a research direction to design an advanced scheme in order to predict the properties of soil. A portable sensor device is a basic need of an agriculture system for the accurate and rapid monitoring of soil macronutrients. Aim: In this research, the soil nutrients identified from the collected soil samples using optical sensors are evaluated for their accuracy using a deep learning approach. Methods: A deep residual network is exploited for the soil nutrient prediction after augmenting the gathered soil data. Finally, various performance evaluation measures, like mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), are calculated to detect how accurately the sensor predicted the soil nutrients. Results: From the experimental analysis, it is stated that the proposed model attained low MSE value of 4.59 eâˆ’09, the low RMSE value of 6.78 eâˆ’05, and the low MAE value of 4.66 eâˆ’05 for N prediction. Likewise, the proposed model attained the least MSE value of 1.41 eâˆ’05, the least RMSE value of 0.0003, and the least MAE value of 0.0001 for P prediction. Conclusion: Finally, for K prediction, the proposed model achieved the least MSE value of 1.54 eâˆ’06, least RMSE value of 1.24 eâˆ’03, and the least MAE value of 1.38 eâˆ’05. Â© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Straw return (SR) has been widely recommended as a conservation agricultural practice in China. However, the effects of SR on crop yield and soil properties are inconsistent across studies of riceâ€“oilseed rape cropping systems in China. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SR on crop yield and soil nutrient content in a riceâ€“oilseed rotation system, and to understand the mechanism of straw return on the difference in yield increases between rice and oilseed rape. Additionally, suitable climate factors, soil properties, and agricultural practices were identified to achieve maximum increases in yield and soil nutrients in a riceâ€“oilseed rotation under SR. This paper is based on a meta-analysis of 1322 observations from 83 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate the effects of climate, initial soil conditions, and agricultural management practices on rice and oilseed rape yields and soil nutrients under SR. The results showed that the responses of oilseed rape and rice yield remained positive, with 12.37\% and 6.54\% increases, and were significantly higher under SR than the control (no SR). Moreover, SR significantly increased the contents of several soil nutrients (soil organic carbon (SOC), total nutrients, available nutrients) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN). Interestingly, the increase in crop yields was attributed to the increase in SOC, total nitrogen, and available potassium. Additionally, the increase in yields was mainly affected by climate factors, initial soil properties, and agronomic practices. For example, both mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) had a positive correlation with crop yield increases under SR (p {\textless} 0.01). Initial soil conditions such as low SOC and total nitrogen content were more suitable for increased rice yield under SR, while the opposite was true for increased oilseed rape yield. Without fertilization, the SR did not significantly improve crop yield and soil nutrients, while it was more pronounced with N fertilization at 150â€“180 kg hmâˆ’2. The positive effect of SR on crop yields is more evident with plowing tillage, whereas the SR caused the highest increase in soil nutrients with the no-tillage condition. These findings have important implications for further improving crop yield, SOC, and soil nutrients in the Chinese riceâ€“oilseed cropping system through straw return. Â© 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Comparing quasi-{3D} soil moisture derived from electromagnetic induction with {1D} moisture sensors and correlation to barley yield in variable duplex soil
VL  - 236
SN  - NA
AB  - Farms in Western Australia (WA) are highly variable in soil texture and water retention capacity; therefore, information of soil moisture spatial variability in the field is important for effective crop management. In practice, farmers often rely on point sensors to determine soil moisture in their fields for crop planning. The limitation of point measurements to account for spatial variability highlights the need to develop methods that can assess soil moisture across variable broadacre fields. This information can enable more effective site-specific crop management practices. In this study, we used a mobile non-intrusive electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor to map soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) to predict soil moisture levels at three different depths (0â€“0.5, 0.5â€“0.8 and 0.8â€“1.6 m) across the field and compared it with barley yield production. To convert the depth specific electrical conductivity (EC) from EMI surveys into soil moisture estimates, calibrations between electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to volumetric moisture were used. These calibrations were developed for the different soil textural classes of the field, with R2 of 0.97â€“0.99. There was no significant difference between the estimated soil moisture from EMI surveys and the point moisture measurements obtained from soil moisture sensors and soil sample extracts, with Pearson R values of 0.64 for 0â€“0.5 m depth and 0.73 for 0.5â€“0.8 m depth. Additionally, correcting the temperature drift relative to the measured soil temperature on EMI surveys by 10\% in dry season and 31\% in wet season, improved the moisture estimation results. This study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of spatial soil moisture estimation using EMI sensor in a field characterized by horizontal and vertical soil texture variability. However, no significant correlation was found between the mapped soil moisture or soil texture with barley yield. This may be due to relatively high initial moisture levels resulting from two years of fallow rotation. Â© 2023 The Authors

TI  - Plant strategy of root system architecture and exudates for acquiring soil nutrients
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Vascular plants develop diverse root system architectures and exudates to facilitate acquisition of soil nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). Plant species have inherently specific properties of root system architectures and exudates, but some plants exhibit high plasticity to respond to spatiotemporal variations in soil nutrient forms and availability. This paper synthesizes evidence on how plant species diversity and root plasticity contribute to soil nutrient mobilization and uptake in plants from the tropics to the Arctic with varying plant species diversity. The development of finer roots in the surface soil is a well-known strategy for the acquisition of limited nutrients (especially phosphorus), but the allocation of roots foraging â€œnutrient hotspotsâ€ in deeper soil (podzolic soil or permafrost-affected soils) is an alternative strategy for coniferous trees tested in the Arctic and boreal forests. This contrasts with findings in tropical forests, where diverse plant species with different capacities of organic acid exudation coexist and species composition shifts in response to phosphorus deficiency. In particular, high malate exudation from roots and rhizosphere microbes stimulates phosphorus solubilization, aluminum detoxification, and lignin degradation in acidic soils. The diversity and plasticity of the root system architecture, root exudation, and the flexibility of nutrient sources mitigate nutrient limitation in soil. Root plasticity facilitating soil nutrient acquisition has a large impact on biogeochemistry and soil formation, such as podzolization, in the long term. Â© 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Integration of organic, inorganic and bio fertilizer, improve maize-wheat system productivity and soil nutrients
VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - The decline in crop yields is attributed to uneven chemical fertilization practices and poor soil fertility. From a sustainability perspective, the application of beneficial microorganisms alongside a blend of inorganic and organic fertilizers significantly influences crop productivity and food security. Concerns within the scientific community arise from the haphazard and negligent use of fertilizers. Farming communities predominantly reliant on chemical fertilizers often overlook the application of organic alternatives, leading to a gradual decline in soil organic matter and native nutrient levels, ultimately resulting in decreased crop yields. In diverse cropping systems, the amalgamation of chemical, biological, and organic sources sustains soil health, replenishes nutrients, and optimizes crop yields. Plant residues enhance soil microbial activity, expedite nutrient cycling and availability, and aid in preserving soil health through carbon sequestration. Regular utilization of plant residues and other organic materials enriches soil organic matter content, enhancing soil health and productivity. Integrating organic and chemical fertilizers presents a potential avenue to enhance maize and soybean yields in maize-wheat cropping systems, subsequently benefiting wheat crop productivity and profitability. The efficacy of specific soil nutrients can be heightened by combining organic sources with various chemical fertilization techniques. Hence, incorporating phosphorus fertilization alongside phosphorus-mobilizing and solubilizing agents (such as Trichoderma \& PSB), along with the integrated management of peach waste materials including residues, compost, and biochar, is imperative for promoting crop growth, increasing seed yields, and fostering environmental sustainability.

TI  - Urban food waste for soil amendment? {Analysis} and characterisation of waste-based compost for soil fertility management in agroecological horticultural production systems in the city of {Rosario}, {Argentina
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Urban and peri-urban lands can be an important source of food production for localised and sustainable food systems, however, their soils can be of poor quality, degraded or damaged by anthropic activities, and little is known about their suitability or safety. This paper aims to contribute to this knowledge gap by assessing the soil remediation capacity and qualities of different types of compost made from urban and peri-urban organic wastes for agroecological food production. Prepared over the course of 2021, and used in 2022 for food growing, five different composts were observed and analysed, in two different farms in the city of Rosario, Argentina. Four raw materials generated largely by local industries were used to make the composts: chicken manure, rumen (cowâ€™s stomachs), brewerâ€™s bagasse (byproducts of the beer industry) and urban leaves collected from the municipality waste collection. These were mixed in different proportions (all reaching the 20â€“30 C/N ratio, typical of quality compost) to produce viable growing substrates where radishes and lettuces were grown. The aim of the study was to assess the possibility, quality and limitations to use locally available organic inputs for soil fertility management in agroecological farming, in the context of urbanisation and to assess pathways to develop closed-cycle agroecological agriculture at metropolitan level. Natural manure substrates (raw and composted) were analysed, as well as crops grown and fertilised with each of the substrates. The attributes and limiting factors of each substrate and their response to local soil conditions were compared and physicochemical, biochemical, and microbiological analyses were performed, including among others, the study of microbial biomass, biological activity, biophytotoxicity, pH, aerobic heterotrophs, nitrogen fixation, and the presence of antibiotics, agrochemicals and heavy metals. The results of the analyses show that all the composted materials improved the physical, chemical and biological properties. However, in some cases, pollutants were present even after composting. Analysis carried out on the vegetables generally indicate undetectable levels or levels below the admissible limits, demonstrating the filtering capacity of the different composts and the soil.

TI  - Shifting cultivation in decline: {An} analysis of soil fertility and weed pressure in intensified cropping systems in {Eastern} {Amazon
VL  - 360
SN  - NA
AB  - Reconciling forest preservation and agricultural production is a major challenge. In Brazil, environmental laws have been introduced to reduce forest degradation associated with the expansion of agriculture. However, these laws are constraining small-scale family farmers who rely on cassava produced in shifting cultivation. Faced by scarcity of land, farmers are reducing the fallow periods on their farms. In this study, our hypothesis was that the reduction of the fallow period in shifting cultivation systems leads to a depletion of soil fertility and an increase in weed pressure. In the Brazilian Eastern Amazon region, soil fertility and weed infestation indicators were assessed in 36 cassava fields under shifting cultivation with different land-use histories. The frequency of cultivation of the fields in the past 10 years ranged from 1 to 7 and averaged 3.7 Â± 2.3. The results show that the most frequently cultivated fields had lower soil fertility, indicated by lower soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and exchangeable potassium and pH. In addition, labor input for weeding and weeding frequency increased with the frequency of cultivation of the fields, indicating that weed pressure increased with intensified crop cultivation and shorter fallow periods. The findings of this study make clear that the current trend of reducing the fallow period in the Eastern Amazon is a threat to the sustainability and productivity of the local shifting cultivation systems. There is an urgent need for alternative production systems that allow for a better weed control and that contribute to restoring and maintaining soil fertility. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a promising tool for remote sensing applications, e.g., soil moisture and drought monitoring. In this paper, soil moisture assessment and drought monitoring are conducted in arid regions of Africa and China from GNSS-R, aiming to enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture retrievals through the integration GNSS-R data in with other available observations. Here it employs an integrated approach, utilizing GNSS-R, LiDAR, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to assess soil moisture dynamics in regions facing water scarcity challenges. The study explores the potential of GNSS-R in combination with other sensors, such as Scatterometry and Altimetry, for comprehensive monitoring, comparison, and calibration. Comparison between African and Chinese arid region contributes to a nuanced understanding of soil moisture dynamics in diverse geographical settings. Furthermore, the implications of these insights for geohazard surveillance and the judicious management of water resources in arid landscapes are given and discussed. This study presents a focused inquiry that underscores the capabilities of GNSS-R technology and its potential to proactively address environmental challenges. The comparative analysis of two distinct arid regions provides a unique vantage point, contributing to the broader global initiative aimed at meticulous monitoring and adept management of soil moisture and drought occurrences.

VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil health plays a crucial role in crop production, both in terms of quality and quantity, highlighting the importance of effective methods for preserving soil quality to ensure global food security. Soil quality indices (SQIs) have been widely utilized as comprehensive measures of soil function by integrating multiple physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. Traditional SQI analysis involves laborious and costly laboratory analyses, which limits its practicality. To overcome this limitation, our study explores the use of visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy as a rapid and non-destructive alternative for predicting soil properties and SQIs. This study specifically focused on seven soil indicators that contribute to soil fertility, including pH, organic matter (OM), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), available phosphorous (P), and total nitrogen (TN). These properties play key roles in nutrient availability, pH regulation, and soil structure, influencing soil fertility and overall soil health. By utilizing vis-NIR spectroscopy, we were able to accurately predict the soil indicators with good accuracy using the Cubist model (R2 = 0.35â€“0.93), offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional laboratory analyses. Using the seven soil indicators, we looked at three different approaches for calculating and predicting the SQI, including: (1) measured SQI (SQI\_m), which is derived from laboratory-measured soil properties; (2) predicted SQI (SQI\_p), which is calculated using predicted soil properties from spectral data; and (3) direct prediction of SQI (SQI\_dp), The findings demonstrated that SQI\_dp exhibited a higher accuracy (R2 = 0.90) in predicting soil quality compared to SQI\_p (R2 = 0.23).

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Seed crop production systems of velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens L.) were assessed in two field studies for ecosystem services. At flowering stage, long duration genotype Arka Shubra was significantly superior in biomass accumulation (14.61 t haâˆ’1), while 100\% recommended NPK + 15 t FYM haâˆ’1 registered significantly higher biomass production (11.74 t haâˆ’1). Biomass availability at harvest was higher in long duration genotypes (7.48â€“7.75 t haâˆ’1) and the average biomass availability of 6.45 t haâˆ’1 at harvest gives scope for including velvet bean as component crop in cropping systems/fallows. The average soil carbon stocks were estimated at 22.8 t haâˆ’1 at the end of 2 yrs and 12.4 t haâˆ’1 at the end of one crop season. Soil nutrient availability was optimum except for soil test P in pre-, standing and post crop growth periods. Highly significant relations (R2 = 0.949) were observed between nodule number and available N at harvest. The N availability was more in long duration genotypes (209â€“215 kg N haâˆ’1) over pre-experimental status. Nutrient addition improved the available N status by 40â€“185 kg haâˆ’1 over pre-experimental status and control. The nutrient uptake was 4â€“10\% higher in Arka Shubra over other long duration genotypes and 100â€“200\% higher over medium/short duration genotypes at flowering. The recyclable biomass and uptake of NPK are more in long duration genotypes implying huge nutrient recycling potential of the system. Overall, seed crop systems of velvet bean are efficient in resource use and energy use ({\textgreater}2.5 EUE) and ideal components for sustainable land management.

TI  - Temperature-{Corrected} {Calibration} of {GS3} and {TEROS}-12 {Soil} {Water} {Content} {Sensors
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - The continuous monitoring of soil water content is commonly carried out using low-frequency capacitance sensors that require a site-specific calibration to relate sensor readings to apparent dielectric bulk permittivity (Kb) and soil water content (Î¸). In fine-textured soils, the conversion of Kb to Î¸ is still challenging due to temperature effects on the bound water fraction associated with clay mineral surfaces, which is disregarded in factory calibrations. Here, a multi-point calibration approach accounts for temperature effects on two soils with medium to high clay content. A calibration strategy was developed using repacked soil samples in which the Kb-Î¸ relationship was determined for temperature (T) steps from 10 to 40 Â°C. This approach was tested using the GS3 and TEROS-12 sensors (METER Group, Inc. Pullman, WA, USA; formerly Decagon Devices). Kb is influenced by T in both soils with contrasting T-Kb relationships. The measured data were fitted using a linear function Î¸ = a (Formula presented.) + b with temperature-dependent coefficients a and b. The slope, a(T), and intercept, b(T), of the loam soil were different from the ones of the clay soil. The consideration of a temperature correction resulted in low RMSE values, ranging from 0.007 to 0.033 cm3 cmâˆ’3, which were lower than the RMSE values obtained from factory calibration (0.046 to 0.11 cm3 cmâˆ’3). However, each experiment was replicated only twice using two different sensors. Sensor-to-sensor variability effects were thus ignored in this study and will be systematically investigated in a future study. Finally, the applicability of the proposed calibration method was tested at two experimental sites. The spatial-average Î¸ from a network of GS3 sensors based on the new calibration fairly agreed with the independent area-wide Î¸ from the Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS). This study provided a temperature-corrected calibration to increase the accuracy of commercial sensors, especially under dry conditions, at two experimental sites. Â© 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Traditional soil fertility management ameliorates climate change impacts on traditional {Andean} crops within smallholder farming systems
VL  - 912
SN  - NA
AB  - Global changes, particularly rising temperatures, threaten food security in smallholder mountain communities by impacting the suitability of cultivation areas for many crops. Land-use intensification, associated with agrochemical use and tillage, threatens soil health and overall agroecosystem resilience. In the Andean region, farmers often cultivate crops at multiple elevations. Warming climates have led to a shift in cultivation upslope, but this is not feasible in many areas. Traditional soil fertility management practices together with a focus on traditional (orphan) crops offers promise to cope with rapid climate warming in the region. To understand the impacts of warming and changing nutrient management, we established two side-by-side experiments using the traditional Andean crops Oxalis tuberosa (Oca) and Lupinus mutabilis (Tarwi) at three elevations, each with two fertility treatments (organic and synthetic). Soil and climate data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) were collected throughout the growing season, and crop performance was evaluated through impacts on yield and other growth metrics (e.g., biomass, pest incidence). We used two-way ANOVA to assess the influence of site (elevation) and management type (organic vs. synthetic) on crop performance. Results indicated that warmer climates (i.e., lowest elevation) negatively impact the production and performance of O. tuberosa, but that organic fertilization (sheep manure) can help maintain crop yield and biomass production in warmer conditions relatively to synthetic nutrient inputs. In contrast, L. mutabilis showed accelerated growth in warmer conditions, but grain yield and biomass production were not significantly affected by site and showed no interaction with nutrient management. Our findings highlight that climate warming represents a serious threat to small-scale crop production in the Peruvian Andes and could cause severe declines in the production of locally important crops. Additionally, the continued reliance on traditional crops with organic inputs, instead of synthetic fertilizers, may help support agricultural productivity and resilience under climate change.

TI  - Conservation tillage in temperate rice cropping systems: {Crop} production and soil fertility
VL  - 308
SN  - NA
AB  - Context: Conventional tillage (i.e. ploughing) that is applied in Italian rice fields ensures high grain yields, but may result in negative effects on physical and chemical fertility of soil. Conservation tillage can be a viable alternative to conventional allowing to reduce the environmental and economic impact of rice cultivation. However, there is limited knowledge on the effects of these alternative tillage systems on rice yield and paddy soil fertility in temperate climates. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on yield and soil fertility of conservation tillage in the medium term in temperate rice continuous monoculture system. Methods: A six-years monocrop rice experiment (2014â€“2019) was carried out in North-West Italy, comparing three tillage methods: conventional tillage (ploughing â€“ CT), minimum tillage (MT), and no tillage (NT) combined with three N fertilization rates (N0, N âˆ’ 120 kg N haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1, and N + âˆ’ 160 kg N haâˆ’1 yearâˆ’1). The study evaluated yield, yield components, plant N uptake, apparent N recovery (ANR), soil bulk density, total soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and C and N distribution between different soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. Results: MT showed a similar grain yield to CT, while a 15 \% reduction was recorded with NT, which was penalized by low plant density and high soil compaction in the surface layer. Although NT exhibited higher panicle density, spikelets per panicle, and 1000-grain weight than CT and MT, these factors were not sufficient to compensate for the grain yield gap. NT resulted in decreased plant N uptake and ANR, making increasing N fertilization in NT ineffective for recovering the yield gap with CT. After six years, no significant difference was found in SOC stock among the tillage treatments. However, conservation tillage influenced the vertical distribution of SOC, resulting in higher concentration in the superficial soil layer (0â€“15 cm) compared to CT. MT led to the highest amounts of labile and physically protected SOM in the 0â€“15 cm layer compared to NT, where lower crop residue input due to lower straw production limited the accumulation of these types of SOM fractions. Conclusions: MT use production resources more efficiently compared to CT and sustains soil fertility by promoting organic matter and nitrogen inputs, facilitating soil aggregation and preventing soil compaction. Yield reductions and excessive soil compaction are the main obstacles to the wide adoption of NT. Implications: Minimum tillage is a viable alternative to conventional tillage for improving the environmental and economic sustainability of Italian temperate rice cropping system, while no tillage may only be suitable for marginal and less productive areas.

TI  - Predictors of inoculant-based technology adoption by smallholder soybean farmers in northern {Ghana}: implications for soil fertility management
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Inoculant-based technologies are environmentally friendly and economic ways to improve soil fertility status by incorporating atmospheric nitrogen into root nodules of leguminous crops to increase crop yield. The uptake of inoculant-based technologies by smallholder farmers in Ghana is not well documented despite measures by research institutions to introduce these technologies to farmers. This study therefore sought to investigate the farmer characteristics, farm-level, input and institutional-level determinants of inoculant-based technology adoption by small-scale soybean producers in Northern Ghana, relying on cross-sectional data and double-hurdle modelling. This study identified the main drivers of inoculant adoption as farmersâ€™ age, sex, educational status, household size, agrochemicals adoption, soil fertility status, extension contact, farmer group membership and participation in off-farm work. Intensity of adoption, expressed as expenditure per hectare on inoculants was significantly influenced by household size, degree of specialization in soybean production, agrochemicals adoption, cost of ploughing, cattle ownership and participation in off-farm work. The results showed that the decision to adopt inoculant technology and the intensity of adoption are influenced by different sets of variables. Improving smallholdersâ€™ access to agricultural extension and promoting participation in farmer groups are expected to enhance inoculant technology adoption to promote grain legume production.

VL  - 430
SN  - NA
AB  - The effective management of nutrient resources in agricultural practices is crucial for optimizing crop yields and ensuring sustainable farming. Traditionally, farmers have relied on manual methods or expert knowledge to determine the appropriate amount and type of nutrients required by crops. However, these methods often lack precision and can lead to suboptimal fertilization, resulting in reduced productivity and environmental degradation. In recent years, advancements in sensor technology have paved the way for more accurate and efficient crop management systems. One such innovation is the NPK sensor, which enables real-time monitoring of soil nutrient levels. Our proposed system utilizes NPK sensor data to offer personalized fertilization recommendations to farmers. The system integrates sensor technology, machine learning algorithms, and agronomic expertise to provide precise and tailored nutrient recommendations based on the specific requirements of different crops and soil conditions. The system collects data from NPK sensors deployed in the field that includes soil nutrient levels. Machine learning algorithms analyze this data to identify patterns and correlation between nutrient levels and crop performance. By leveraging historical data and agronomic knowledge, the system can generate accurate and timely recommendations for nutrient application. In conclusion, the crop recommendation system presented here offers a novel approach to crop management by leveraging NPK sensor technology and machine learning. By providing accurate and personalized nutrient recommendations, the system has the potential to revolutionize modern agriculture, enhancing productivity while promoting environmental stewardship. Further research and field trials are needed to validate and refine the system's performance and usability, but the preliminary results show promising potential for the adoption of such system in real-world agricultural settings.

TI  - Determinants of adoption and adoption intensity of integrated soil fertility management technologies among sorghum farmers in {Upper} {Eastern} {Kenya
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Climate change manifestations and population pressure are some of the most critical challenges that affect agricultural productivity. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies are among the agricultural innovations that have been developed to address declining crop productivity. These technologies have been promoted across diverse areas including marginal agro-ecological zones. Despite the nobility and versatility of ISFM technologies, their adoption is still low particularly across Kenya landscapes. Consequently, there is limited knowledge explaining the adoption of these technologies especially in the dry areas. This study therefore, applied Cragg's Double Hurdle model to determine the factors affecting adoption and adoption intensity of ISFM technologies among farmers in Upper Eastern Kenya, who mainly grow sorghum both as a food and a cash crop. The results revealed that gender, dependants, farming goal for subsistence purpose (p {\textless}.01), decision on information use, farm size, extension services, research awareness, ISFM awareness and ISFM access, significantly affected household decision on adoption of ISFM technologies. On the other hand, gender of household head, farm size, main source of agricultural information and formal agricultural training had significant influence on adoption intensity of ISFM technologies. There is a thus a crucial need for integration of determinants surrounding adoption and adoption intensity of ISFM technologies in policy making and planning processes to enhance sorghum crop productivity in marginal Upper Eastern areas of the country.

TI  - Deciphering the role of particulate organic matter in soil nitrogen transformation in riceâ€“rapeseed and riceâ€“wheat rotation systems
VL  - 193
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop rotation affects the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and thereby alter the composition of SOM fractions. It remains unclear how different SOM fractions impact soil nitrogen (N) transformation in various rotation systems. The aim of this study was to ascertain the role of particulate organic matter (POM)-a labile SOM fraction-in soil N transformation under various crop rotations. A paired plot experiment was conducted under two common cropping patterns, i.e., riceâ€“rapeseed rotation (RR) vs. riceâ€“wheat rotation (RW). Soil chemical composition and organic matter fraction before rice transplanting were compared between RR and RW systems after four years of crop rotations (2017â€“2021). With the same N inputs, the rice yield and N uptake under RR were 16.4 \% and 13.2 \% higher than those under RW, respectively. Compared with RW, RR resulted in higher carbon (C) and N contents in soil POM, despite minimal differences in total SOM. A larger potentially mineralizable N pool and a higher N mineralization rate occurred under RR than under RW, based on the results of soil net mineralization experiment. When POM was incubated alone, its contribution to potentially mineralizable N was 65.1 \% and 61.3 \% in RR and RW soils, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that in contrast with RW, RR promoted the accumulation of organic matter with high bioavailability (e.g., amides, carbohydrates, polysaccharides) in soil POM. This might be responsible for the higher gross mineralization and nitrification rates but lower gross immobilization rate under RR than under RW. Consequently, RR not only increased the contents of POMC and POMN but also improved the quality of POM fraction in soils. Findings of the present study demonstrate that POM plays a distinct role in soil N mineralization in various rotation systems. The discrepancy in POM content and composition resulting from various crop rotations leads to differences in soil N mineralization, which in turn affects the N supply and rice yield.

TI  - Monitoring soil fertility to mitigate soil degradation in reclamation land after bauxite mining
VL  - 1314
SN  - NA
AB  - Bauxite is one of the minerals mined in an open pit system. Mining with this system will initially cause soil degradation because the soil layer covering the bauxite ore will be removed first from the mining location. The top soil will be returned after the bauxite ore extraction is complete. Returning soil to the mining site causes quite severe soil degradation because the process of taking and returning the top soil is carried out by an excavator which mixes the soil. As a result of this process, the soil in the reclamation area changes its chemical, physical and biological properties. To mitigate soil degradation in the reclamation area after bauxite mining, soil fertility status monitoring is carried out. This monitoring activity was expected to be able to identify and reduce the level of soil damage in post-bauxite mining reclamation land. Â© 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

TI  - Farming systems and soil fertility management practices in smallholdings on the southern slopes of {Mount} {Kilimanjaro}, {Tanzania
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - In the northern part of Tanzania, the slopes of Mount (Mt.) Kilimanjaro are the most important areas, both in terms of socio-economic development and ecological succession. The main agricultural systems in the area are banana-based (in the highlands) and maize-based (in the lowlands), with strong interlinkage between them via residual transfer from the lowlands to the mountains. This study assessed the soil fertility status between the two contrasting farming areas of highland and lowland farms in Hai district along the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. To achieve this, smallholder farmers along the slope [from above 1000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l) banana-based down to maize-based, i.e., less than 1000 m.a.s.l] who practice crop residual transfer from maize-based to banana-based farming systems were selected. Qualitative information regarding the demographics, farming practices, and soil fertility management in the two areas were gathered using a semi-structured questionnaire. Soils from both areas (highland and lowland farms) were collected and analyzed in the laboratory for the key soil properties. The demographic results show that agriculture is mostly done by adults and elders ({\textgreater}40 years old). Manure was most commonly reported to be used in the highlands, while inorganic fertilizers were mainly used in lowland areas. The major challenges for soil fertility management are a shortage of manure and high cost of inorganic fertilizers. The results of soil nutrients revealed that lowland zones ({\textgreater}1000 m.a.s.l) had significantly (p{\textless} 0.01) lower levels of nitrogen (0.14\%) and organic carbon (OC) (1.22\%) compared with highland zones. Extractable phosphorus (P) was significantly lower in both the highland and lowland zones, at 9.3 mg kg-1 and 8.2 mg kg-1, respectively, compared with other nutrients. However, potassium (K+) was significantly (p{\textless}0.01) lower [0.34 cmol (+) kg-1] in the highland zone compared to lowland areas. The data show that there is a severe depletion of soil nutrients in the lowland area of Hai district. Notwithstanding the efforts of the small-holder farmers; the study comes to the conclusion that increasing agricultural yield and the sustainability of farming systems require replenishing the nutrients in the soil along the slope of Mount Kilimanjaro.

TI  - Importance of soil fertility for climate-resilient cropping systems: {The} farmer's perspective
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Healthy and productive agricultural soils are the basis for global food security as they are a prerequisite for yield-stable cropping systems under climate change. Despite the expansion of agricultural research activities in this area through field experiments, lab analyses, and modelling frameworks, current empirical insights from farming practice on a more national scale are still rare. For this reason, the agronomic importance of soil fertility for farming practice was the focus of this nationwide empirical study conducted in Germany (winter/spring 2022) with a total sample size of 585. The views and needs of 370 farmers and 215 agricultural institutionalists were evaluated, i.a., regarding the importance of soil fertility and related soil properties, as well as preferred agronomic management strategies and needs for the promotion of soil fertility. The results showed that most farmers and institutionalists consider soil fertility to be very important. Moreover, it was emphasized that the importance of this factor will increase in the future due to changing climatic conditions (e.g., heat/drought stress) and the need for more sustainable land use including the protection of biodiversity. The main motivations for agronomic investments in greater soil fertility were improving the climate resilience and yield stability of cropping systems. In this context, the top soil properties of interest were ranked by the respondents as follows: (1) water storage capacity, (2) rootability, (3) biological activity, and (4) water infiltration rate. To promote soil fertility, farmers mainly considered catch cropping, diversified crop rotations with a positive humus balance, and year-round ground plant cover/mulch as the most useful agronomic measures. In terms of methods for the assessment of soil fertility, soil structure analyses, biological indicators, yield/biomass production, soil nutrient analyses, and field methods were most important, whereas sensor systems and apps/digital tools were of minor importance. For the future improvement of soil fertility promotion in farming practice, simple indicators and reference values for assessing soil fertility as well as 'workshops, field days, and field schools' for training aspects were suggested by the participants. Overall, there were few differences between the perceptions of farmers and agricultural institutionalists. Both groups pointed out the need for improved communication between politics, science, and practice such that agriculture can respond more quickly to changing climatic conditions in the future.

TI  - Reproduction of soil fertility in adaptive landscape farming systems of the foothill zone of the {RNO}-{Alania
VL  - 463
SN  - NA
AB  - Modern intensification of agriculture has significantly speeded up the processes of land destruction and loss of its fertility. This has led to the deterioration in the agroecological situation, boost in the potential fertility of land, and a significant decrease in yields and quality of agricultural products. The purpose of our research was the rational use of land, while compacting the link of the grain crop rotation. The studies were carried out in the foothill zone of the Republic of North Ossetia - Alania, on leached chernozems, in the subzone of sufficient moisture. In the experiments, oats were sown in pure form, mixed with peas, as well as a variant of a pea-oat-sunflower mixture, with harvesting terms for green fodder, grain haylage and grain. Today pea-oat-sunflower mixture, unlike corn for silage, is a resource-saving, low-cost and multicomponent mixture. After harvesting these crops, the crop rotation is compacted by buckwheat crops for grain. With such a sparing use of land resources, the high self-cleaning ability of these mixtures and buckwheat reduces the cost and increases the productivity of arable land. An increase in soil fertility is achieved by introducing green manure crops (winter and spring rapeseed, oilseed radish, white mustard, winter rye, etc.), which, when plowing, improve the soil structure (structural coefficient up to 3), boost the humus content in the soil by 0.02 - 0.05\%, neutralize the acidity of the soil environment (up to pH = 5.5 - 6,7), clean the soil from excess nitrates, heavy metals, pesticide residues, etc., and enhance the yield by 15-20\%.

TI  - Close-to-{Nature} management shifts soil phosphorus availability and {P}-cycling genes in {Chinese} fir systems
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Background and Aims: Phosphorus (P) plays a vital role in plant physiology, and the soils of Chinese fir-producing areas are rich in aluminum and iron ions, making phosphorus highly susceptible to fixation. Insufficient phosphorus nutrient supply is a main constraint to the sustainability of Chinese fir plantations. The aim of this study is to ameliorate the problem of soil available phosphorus deficiency in Chinese fir plantations by changing the management mode, introducing local broad-leaved tree species to form multiple layers of different ages, thereby enhancing soil productivity. Methods: The properties and phosphorus fractions of the surface soils (0-20 cm), litter and leaf nutrients were determined, and macro-genomic technique was used to explore changes of soil phosphorus cycling (P-cycling) genes. Results: (1) The close-to-nature management (CNM) significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (AP) content and affected litter and plant nutrients. (2) The CNM affected the availability of soil phosphorus. The labile phosphorus (resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi) and moderately labile phosphorus (NaOH-Pi) were significantly higher in CNM forests than in Chinese fir plantation. (3) The relative abundances of most of the P-cycling genes differed between the forests, with higher abundances of P-solubilization (ppa), P-mineralization (phnL and opd) and P-regulatory (phoB) genes in CNM forests. Moreover, MBC (microbial biomass carbon), SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and LTP (litter total phosphorus) were the main factors affecting the composition of soil P-cycling genes. Conclusions: The CNM affected properties (soil, litter and plant) and improved soil phosphorus availability and the relative abundance of P-cycling genes. This study revealed the regulation mechanism of P-cycling in the CNM of Chinese fir plantation from microbial P-cycling genes perspective, which highlights the importance of P supply and microbial metabolic strategy by CNM of Chinese fir plantation.

VL  - 71

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a critical factor in determining the potential yield of crops, and agronomic practices play a crucial role in regulating the forms and availability of N in soils to the plant. Therefore, this study employed a split-plot design, where the main plots were allocated to four tillage methods: zero tillage with crop residue retention (ZT+R), zero tillage with crop residue removal (ZT-R), conventional tillage (CT), and undisturbed soils (UD). The sub-plots were designated for four cropping systems: pearl millet-chickpea (PM-C), pearl millet-chickpea-fodder pearl millet (PM-C-FPM), pearl millet-chickpea-mung bean (PM-C-M), and the natural grasses in UD. The study aimed to understand the effects of different management practices on various forms of N in soil, including mineral-N, hot-water extractable organic N (HWEON), and available N (AvlN), as well as mineral N stock, HWEON stock, and total N stock in different soil layers. The study found that ZT+R significantly increased soil mineral N content and stock by 20\% compared to CT across 0-30 cm soil depth. The effects of these practices on mineral-N concentrations were most pronounced in the surface soil layer. Furthermore, ZT practices and legume-based cropping systems enhanced N concentration and its availability. The study also revealed that HWEON content and its stocks were more sensitive to soil tillage practices than cropping systems, with ZT+R having 3.79 times higher HWEON concentration than CT at 0-5 cm soil depth. The significant differences for total N among tillage practices were more pronounced under ZT+R compared to CT. The research highlights the need for using conservation tillage practices, such as ZT+R, in combination with legume-based cropping systems to improve N availability and enhance soil fertility.

VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility plays a pivotal role in agricultural productivity, with its status largely determined by essential nutrients, including cation exchange capacity, base saturation, phosphorus, potassium, and soil organic matter. Insufficient nutrient supply often results in suboptimal agricultural productivity, particularly in agrarian nations. This study aimed to address this challenge by quantifying soil properties and fertility, with a case study from the Unda watershed in Bali Province, Indonesia. The objective was to analyze the soil's chemical properties to provide a foundation for assessing soil fertility status. The adopted methodology integrated spatial analysis with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), coupled with field-based soil surveys and laboratory analysis of soil samples. The findings revealed a range of soil fertility statuses within the Unda watershed, classified as low, medium, and high. A common limiting factor identified across these statuses was the low content of soil organic matter. To address this deficiency, it is recommended that balanced, location-specific fertilization strategies be implemented on agricultural land. Such an approach could ensure the effective and efficient availability of soil nutrients, thereby potentially enhancing agricultural productivity. Â©2023 IIETA.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a crucial role in various environmental processes and is essential for agricultural management, hydrological modeling, and climate studies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing presents significant potential for estimating soil moisture due to its ability to operate in all weather conditions and provide day-and-night imaging capabilities. Among the SAR configurations, the Compact Polarimetric (CP) mode has gained increasing interest as it relaxes system constraints, improves coverage, and enhances target information compared to conventional dual polarimetric SAR systems. This paper introduces a novel approach for soil moisture retrieval utilizing machine learning algorithms and CP SAR features. The CP SAR features are derived from a series of RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) CP SAR imagery acquired over Canadian experimental sites equipped with Real-Time In Situ Soil Monitoring for Agriculture (RISMA) stations. This study employs a diverse dataset of compact polarimetric SAR features and corresponding ground truth soil moisture measurements for training and validation purposes. The results of our study achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.88\% with a coefficient of determination R2 equal to 0.60, which corresponds to a correlation R between true and predicted soil moisture values of 0.75, using optimized Ensemble Learning Regression (ELR) with a decision-tree-based model. These results improved, yielding an RMSE of 5.67\% and an R2 equal to 0.73 (R = 0.85), using an optimized Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. Â© 2023 by the authors.

SN  - NA
AB  - The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), a publicly accessible spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data, provides a new alternative opportunity for large-scale soil moisture (SM) retrieval, but with interference from complex environmental conditions (i.e., vegetation cover and ground roughness). This study aims to develop a high-accuracy model for CYGNSS SM retrieval. The normalized surface reflectivity calculated by CYGNSS is fused with variables that are highly related to the SM obtained from optical/microwave remote sensing to solve the problem of the influence of complicated environmental conditions. The Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) model aided by land-type data is then used to construct a multi-variables SM retrieval model with six different land types of multiple models. The methodology is tested in southeastern China, and the results correlate very well with the existing satellite remote sensing products and in situ SM data (R = 0.765, ubRMSE = 0.054 m3mâˆ’3 vs. SMAP; R = 0.653, ubRMSE = 0.057 m3 mâˆ’3 vs. ERA5 SM; R = 0.691, ubRMSE = 0.057 m3mâˆ’3 vs. in situ SM). This study makes contributions from two aspects: (1) improves the accuracy of the CYGNSS retrieval of SM based on fusion with other auxiliary data; (2) constructs the SM retrieval model with multi-layer multiple models, which is suitable for different land properties.

TI  - Bacterial community diversity for three selected land use systems as affected by soil moisture regime
VL  - 192
SN  - NA
AB  - Despite their important role in soil nutrient cycling, soil bacterial communities' response to land management practices and soil hydrologic fluctuations are not sufficiently studied. The effects of land use and soil moisture regime on soil bacterial community structure and diversity in the Missouri River Floodplain have been investigated in this study. Three land use systems represented riparian forest (RF), pecan (Carya illinoinensis) orchard/hay agroforestry system (AF), and row crop corn [Zea mays L.]/soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] agriculture system (AG). Microbial diversity indices and the abundance of selected bacterial phyla were investigated in bulk soil samples by performing 16 s rRNA amplicon sequencing. Soil samples were collected from three selected land use systems in September 2020 and May 2021. To simulate the hydrological dynamics of the riparian systems, intact soil cores were subjected to two different soil moisture regimes: saturated (FD) and alternately saturated and field capacity (FL) for 8 weeks of incubation. A control sample was maintained at field capacity for the entire duration of the experiment. Soil physicochemical properties substantially differed among land use. Soil organic matter (OM\%) was significantly greater in AF and RF than in AG. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Acidobacteriota were found to be the most dominant bacterial phyla across all samples. The bacterial richness and Shannon indices were not considerably different among land use systems. Soil FD conditions considerably increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota in AF soils. The abundance of these phyla was strikingly higher in AF with the greatest organic matter relative to AG and RF under all three water regimes. Further work may be needed to assess the effects of hydrological events on floodplain soils' microbial community indices. Â© 2023

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important quantity to examine in terms of agriculture, meteorology, and hydrology to understand the evaporation cycle and drought mechanisms. This study aims to estimate surface soil moisture in arid areas using Sentinel-1A SAR data. In order to collect soil samples from sampling grids that are synchronized with Sentinel-1A passes, study area is divided into 80 grids, each measuring 10 m by 10 m. Six SAR images were collected from Copernicus Open Access Hub website. The vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated using a Sentinel-2A image. The SNAP software was used to process the SAR images, and R studio was used to extract NDVI values and backscattered energy of each sample grid. In this study, an empirical equation was developed to model surface soil moisture using the dielectric constant and backscattering coefficients. The performance of the model was assessed using statistical indicators such as the coefficient of correlation, Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency, and root mean square error, which yielded results of 0.85, 1.46, and 0.75, respectively.

SN  - NA
AB  - Open pit mining causes damage in natural and rural regions; that is why soil restoration is necessary in order to recovery soilâ€“plant systems. The application of waste can be a good solution for rehabilitation, and it clearly complies with the circular economy and the zero-waste strategy. This study was carried out in a quarry restoration area in the southeast of Spain, where experimental plots were designed and fertilized with different amendments (commonly used inorganic fertilizer N-K-P, pig slurry, pruning waste and urban solid wastes) with the objective of studying ways to improve the restoration of the soil by using these residues and increase the soil fertility before planting. The treatments applied were evaluated in the short term (two and four months from their addition to topsoil) and medium term (nine months) in order to determine if the restored soils will be adequate for agriculture based on nutrientsâ€™ availability. The results showed that in all the treatments, the pH exceeded 8.5 due to the nature of the soil matrix, but after 9 months of the application, in the plots treated with NPK and pig slurry, the pH decreased. In general, with the application of the treatments, soil macro- (N, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg) and micro-nutrients (Fe and Cu) were increased. However, pig slurry and urban solid waste favored N and P, respectively. Â© 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Soil moisture mapping for drought monitoring in urban areas
VL  - 1314
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important indicator for drought monitoring. Mapping of soil moisture in this study uses remote sensing, namely Landsat 9 OLI imagery, because it can be relied upon as a cheap source of information, and its good temporal resolution or revisit period. Two parameters indirectly related to soil moisture, namely vegetation were analyzed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach, and land surface temperature (LST). Drought analysis was verified using the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI). The remote sensing imagery used in this study is Landsat 9 OLI imagery by selecting images with 30\% cloud cover from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 with the support of the cloud-based Google Earth Engine computing platform. The results of the analysis indicate high LST values in the southern part of the study area whose dominant land use is built-up areas, namely in the sub-districts of Depok, Gamping, Ngaglik, and Mlati. The effect of vegetation on soil moisture is indicated by the NDVI value, which has a relatively strong positive correlation with SMI (R= 0.46). The SMI value is in contrast to LST, where the spatial distribution of high SMI is spread in the northern part, namely Pakem, Cangkringan, and Turi districts. On the other hand, a low SMI is spread across the central and southern parts of the study area, which have a high drought index (extreme moderate). Overall, it is concluded that the SMI has the potential to map drought and is a reliable index for initial analysis of drought risk management. Â© 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - One of the most important branches of agriculture is crop production, from which people receive most of their basic foodstuffs, animal feed, and raw materials for the main industries. The most important goal of crop production is to increase yields in every possible way and, as a result, increase the production of grain, feed, and other products. The study aimed to analyze the influence of sowing dates, soil fertility, and crop rotation system on the yield level of various varieties of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To achieve this goal, field and production experiments, laboratory analyses, and phenological observations were carried out in Akmola and North Kazakhstan regions with different soil and climatic conditions. The following activities and experiments were carried out: Agrochemical survey of experimental and production fields, sowing and harvesting of various wheat varieties. The influence of sowing dates, fertility parameters, as well as various technical aspects of the use of crop rotations on the level of wheat yield has been analyzed. It has been concluded that it is possible to increase the yield of wheat in the current economic conditions under the condition of optimization and strict compliance with the basic agrotechnological requirements, such as compliance with optimal sowing dates, the introduction of scientifically based crop rotations and economically advantageous structure of crops and planned compensation of those nutrients that are at a minimum to increase soil fertility.

TI  - Effect of remediation technologies on soil fertility in heavy metal(loid)-contaminated soils: {A} critical review
VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Contamination of heavy metal(loid) in soils is a global problem. Various remediation technologies have thus been applied to mitigate the ecological and health risk of heavy metal(loid)s in contaminated soils. Majority of review studies mainly focus on the mobility or accumulation of heavy metal(loid)s, but little attention has been paid to the alteration of soil fertility (e.g. soil nutrient, structure and enzyme activities) which are most closely related to plant growth during the remediation process. Here, we summarized influence of physical, chemical and biological remediation technologies of contaminated soils on soil fertility, and they indicated that: (1) thermal treatment and soil washing usually decreased soil nutrients and enzyme activities, as well as deteriorated soil structure; (2) biological technologies usually improved soil structure or microorganism activities, but the decrease of soil fertility through nutrient uptake by plants cannot be ignored; (3) the soil amendments displayed various influence on soil fertility, which depended on their properties; (4) combination of multiple technologies could neutralize the negative influence of single technology on soil fertility. In the future, technologies which could both decrease heavy metal(loid) toxicity and improve soil fertility are more recommended. Â© 2024 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Machine learning enabled {IoT} system for soil nutrients monitoring and crop recommendation
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the growing global population. But optimizing crop production and resource management remains a significant challenge for farmers. This research paper proposes an innovative ML-enabled IoT device to monitor soil nutrients and provide accurate crop recommendations. The device utilizes the FC-28 sensor, DHT11 sensor, and JXBS-3001 sensor to collect real-time data on soil composition, moisture, humidity, temperature, and for nutrient levels. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze the collected data and generate customized recommendations, including a possible high-yielding crop list, fertilizer names, and its amount based on crop requirements and soil nutrients. Furthermore, the applied fertilizers and treatments to the field during production are stored in the database. As a result, it has become possible to determine the quality of the produce at the consumer level through the mobile app. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through field experiments, comparing its performance with traditional methods. The results demonstrate the device's ability to enhance crop productivity and optimize resource utilization, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and food security. The research contributes to IoT-enabled agriculture, demonstrating the potential of ML techniques in improving soil nutrient management, facilitating informed decision-making about crop fertilizers, and assessing the quality of produced crops at the consumer level.

VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - The article presents data of research on conservation and improvement of soil fertility using precision farming technologies. The study was carried out under conditions of humid climate (North-West of Russia, Leningrad region). Technologies for differentiated application of nitrogen fertilizers were tested in the fields of the Agrophysical Research Institute. In comparison with high-intensity agricultural technologies, differentiated fertilizer application was used, which was carried out with the help of a solid mineral fertilizer spreader with an on-board computer and GPS Amazon ZA-M 1500. Precision farming technologies had slightly more complex modifications. They were characterized by the introduction of increasingly informative methods of differentiated use of nitrogen fertilizers, which reduced fertilizer doses. New instruments, equipment and technologies were used, including the use of an N-sensor optical instrument, aerial photographic maps and calibration test sites with predefined nitrogen doses.

TI  - Pretreatment method standard normal variate ({SNV}) and baseline shift correction ({BSC}) on the {NIRS}-based soil spectrum for rapid prediction of soil nitrogen content
VL  - 1290
SN  - NA
AB  - Enhancing agricultural production quality is a crucial role of nitrogen fertilization. Generally, the utilization of nitrogen fertilizer can promote plant growth, impart a more intense green hue to leaves and stems, and significantly augment biomass production. However, excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers can result in substantial cultivation cost increase and serious environmental degradation. Hence, it's important to regulate the nitrogen content within the soil. The primary goal of this research is to employ the NIRS technique to rapidly and eco-friendly predict soil nitrogen content. Soil samples were obtained from farmlands situated in the Aceh Besar district, with spectral data gathered within a wavelength range of 1000 - 2500 nm at 0.2 nm intervals.. NIRS and Partial Least Square (PLS) spectrum data were used to make a prediction model of the nitrogen harvesting element. The results showed that the PLS method with SNV (R=0,72) and BSC (R=0,73) pretreatment showed predictive model capabilities that were almost the same as the raw data (R=0,75), although there was a slight improvement, this suggested that nitrogen elements in Aceh Besar region have not or can use the model with the suggestion to increase the amount of data and improve the treatment of the soil harvester method so that the nitrous content elements present in the ground do not easily evaporate so as to provide better model prediction results.

VL  - 302
SN  - NA
AB  - The cultivation of Chinese milk vetch (MV) as green manure is an effective practice for improving paddy soil fertility and rice yields in China. However, few studies have investigated the effects of MV on phosphorus (P) availability and the risk of P loss. An 11-year field experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of returning MV to paddy soil on soil P forms, late rice yield and soil fertility, as well as the related mechanisms. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) F0M0 (no-fertilizer and no-MV); (2) F1M0 (chemical fertilizer alone), (3) F2M0 (70\% of chemical fertilizer), and F2MV1â€“4 (70\% of chemical fertilizer and 7500 kg ha-1 MV, 15000 kg ha-1 MV, 22500 kg ha-1 MV, 30000 kg ha-1 MV). The Olsen-P of F2M1â€“4 were significantly higher (38.3â€“54.5\%) than that of F2M0 and the CaCl2-P levels of F2M1â€“4 were significantly lower (47.7â€“61.6\%) than that of F1M0. The Olsen-P was mainly influenced by soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, free Fe/Al (FeDCB/AlDCB), organic bound Fe (Feo), noncrystalline amorphous Al (Alox) and exchange Mg2+, while the CaCl2-P was mainly influenced by TP, pH Alox, FeDCB, AlDCB and exchange Mg2+/Ca2+. Partial least squares path model analysis indicated that chemical fertilizer played more important role on the Olsen-P and the CaCl2-P. MV application had the negative effect (the total effect value âˆ’0.48) on the CaCl2-P and decreased the risk of P loss yet. Two-segment regression analyses indicated the critical Olsen-P levels were 19.39 mg kg-1 for late rice yield and 31.94 mg kg-1 for soluble P, respectively. In conclusion, the continuous application of MV not only improved P availability to enhance late rice yield, but also reduced the risk of P loss in paddy soil in double rice systems.

AB  - Purpose: Phosphorus (P) is important for production in double-cropped wheat and cotton systems. The spatial distribution of soil Olsen-P has not been examined in these systems, and was quantified in the study reported here. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted comprising mono-cotton as control (CM), and wheat-cotton 3:1 (3 rows of wheat, 1 row cotton), and wheat-cotton 6:2 (6 rows of wheat, 2 rows of cotton) cropping systems. Soil samples were collected spatially using the spatial grid method. The distribution of soil Olsen-P was analyzed using the Kriging method. Results: The contour map could reflect the distribution of soil Olsen-P. The Olsen-P were concentrated near its application onto the soil surface and decreased with depth. And this distribution was changed by the uptake and interception of crop roots. The P concentrated in the cotton rows were quickly reduced, with little change in the middle of the two rows in the CM. When wheat existed, soil Olsen-P accumulated under wheat roots, and marginally moved horizontally to the cotton rows after wheat was harvested. Conclusions: The geo-statistical method provided an effective method to display the distribution and movement of soil nutrients. The spatial and temporal distribution of Olsen-P was significantly affected by fertilization and crop uptake. In different cropping systems, difference in the competitiveness of crop also had significant impacts on the distribution of soil Olsen-P. The present study provided favorable information for exploring the relationship between plant and soil. Â© 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

VL  - 1092 LNEE
SN  - NA
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of soil moisture in farmland is of great significance to the evaluation of crop growth and drought. Global Navigation Satellite System interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR), as a new remote sensing technology, can invert soil moisture based on the signal-to-noise ratio recorded by the measuring receiver. At present, existing studies tend to invert soil moisture in bare soil or low vegetation cover environments, and satellite selection depends on empirical values or prior information. Accordingly, a multisatellite combination method based on cross-correlation satellite selection for soil moisture inversion is proposed. Firstly, the trend and modulation terms in the signal-to-noise ratio of each satellite are effectively extracted by wavelet analysis. The characteristic of the wave term is analyzed, and the arc segment with an obvious and stable periodic oscillation is selected. Then, based on the interference phase of each satellite obtained by nonlinear least squares fitting, a cross-correlation satellite selection method (CCSSM) is established. The available satellites are selected by setting a reasonable threshold. Finally, three multi-satellite combination models for soil moisture inversion are constructed, and the inversion effects of each model are compared and analyzed. Taking the sugarcane planting area as an example, the results indicate that satellites can be screened quickly and effectively by CCSSM, and the selected satellites have strong cross-correlation. For short-term Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observation data, it is more advantageous to use multiple linear regression model to invert soil moisture than machine learning.

TI  - The effect of organic and inorganic soil fertility management technologies on smallholder farmersâ€™ net revenue and nutrition security: {Evidence} from southwest region of {Ethiopia
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Technologies are better evaluated as packages, i.e., bundles of adoption decisions, rather than a segregate adoption, given the preeminent effect of the combinations on food and nutrition security, productivity, and other welfare outcomes. This study therefore assessed the effect of organic and inorganic soil fertility management technologies on net revenue and Nutrition security of smallholder farmers in Southwest Ethiopia. A multinomial endogenous switching regression (MESR) model, which captures both self-selection bias and the interactions between choices of alternative packages, was applied for this study since farmersâ€™ adoption decisions are likely influenced by unobservable characteristics that may be correlated with the outcomes of interest. The investigation result revealed that, from the three adoption combinations of organic and inorganic soil fertility management technologies, joint adoption of the two technology groups was found to have a significant effect on both net revenue and Nutrition security simultaneously. Unlikely, the isolated adoption of the two soil fertility management technologies may not result in an intended nutrition security outcome. Thus, for the simultaneous improvement in net revenue and nutrition security, the study recommends concentrating on the joint practice of the two organic and inorganic soil fertility management technologies.

TI  - Investigation into the {Effects} of {Different} {Restoration} {Techniques} on the {Soil} {Nutrient} {Status} in {Degraded} {Stipa} grandis {Grassland
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - The degradation and desertification of grassland ecosystems have garnered significant attention both domestically and internationally. Grassland restoration techniques are widely considered a principal measure to promote the sustainable utilization of grasslands, with soil nutrient content being a core indicator for assessing the effectiveness of restoration in degraded grasslands. This study aims to explore the differential impacts of various grassland restoration methods on soil nutrient distribution in degraded Stipa grandis grasslands. Three major restoration methods, i.e., root cutting, enclosure, and fertilization, were applied in the study area. The soil nutrient content was measured and analyzed under the different restoration methods and at varying depths. The results revealed that under all three restoration methods and at different soil depths (0â€“10 cm, 10â€“20 cm, 20â€“30 cm), the organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, alkali-hydrolyzable phosphorus, and available potassium contents were significantly higher than those in the control group (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, as soil depth increased, the contents of organic matter and all nutrients gradually decreased. Specifically, regarding the contents of different nutrients, the order of organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, and available phosphorus was as follows: fertilization {\textgreater} enclosure {\textgreater} root cutting {\textgreater} control, while the contents of total potassium and available potassium followed the sequence: fertilization {\textgreater} enclosure {\textgreater} control {\textgreater} root cutting. Additionally, based on the canonical correlation analysis (R2 = 0.88), the total phosphorus content in soil had the greatest impact on soil nutrients, while vegetation cover and plant height contributed the most to vegetation characteristics. In grassland restoration, the increase in soil total phosphorus led to higher vegetation cover and height, mildly influenced plant diversity and density, and simultaneously promoted biomass accumulation. These research findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for the application of grassland restoration techniques, contributing to the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Comparison of cover crop termination methods for small-scale organic vegetable production: effect on soil fertility and health
VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - Termination methods and the timing of the termination of the cover crops are critical factors determining the efficacy of cover crops in improving soil fertility and quality. We hypothesized that different termination methods will produce varying quantities of organic residue which will affect microbial diversity and thereby nutrient cycling and availability. The objective of this study was to compare termination methods (roller-crimper, flail mowing, rotary mowing, sickle bar mowing, and occultation using black tarps) for fall-grown cover crop combination (hairy vetch-cereal rye) under organic vegetable production. Field experiments were carried out in three consecutive years (2018â€“2021) and soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm and processed for analysis. Soil organic matter content, nutrients, health parameters, enzymes, and microbial diversity were measured. Flail mowing significantly enhanced the potentially mineralizable nitrogen, available phosphorus, and active carbon. Total Phospholipid Fatty Acid (PLFA) analysis showed a 24\% increase for flail mowed, 17\% for rotary mowed, and 15\% for sickle bar mowed termination methods. There was a significant increase in active carbon content which ranged from 38.9\% (rotary mowed), 25.4\% (sickle bar mowed), 23.5\% (flail mowed), 16.4\% for crimper rolled method, and with 2.8\% (occultation) respectively. Individual termination methods had varying effects on select enzyme activities. Results indicated that integrating cover crops has the potential to modify soil microbial community structure and increase soil enzyme activities. In this study, flail mowing appeared to be a good method for managing cover crops of choice in terms of soil microbial functionality and fertility. Â© 2024 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Continuous potassium fertilization combined with straw return increased soil potassium availability and risk of potassium loss in rice-upland rotation systems
VL  - 344
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop residues perform an essential role in the material cycling and energy exchange processes and are commonly used as an organic soil amendment and potassium (K) substitute to enhance field productivity in rice-upland rotation systems. Elucidating the effects of continuous K fertilization combined with straw return on the fate of soil K is of great significance to the scientific application of K fertilization and the sustainable development of the ecological environment. A short-(5 years) and a long-term (38 years) field experiments at the Wuxue (WX) and Wangcheng (WC) sites respectively were conducted to study the effects of continuous K fertilization combined with straw return on soil potassium (K) fertility and loss. Results showed that K fertilization and straw return improved soil K supply capacity significantly. K fertilization (NPK) and straw return (NPK + ST) at WX and WC sites significantly increased soil exchangeable K content (KE) by 27.7\%â€“102.1\% and 36.6\%â€“100.0\%, respectively, compared with that of the treatment without K (NP). K release kinetics showed that most K+ was released in soil of the NPK+ST treatment, indicating a stronger soil K+ supplying capacity. Long-term K deficit resulted in the conversion of illite to interlayer minerals and kaolinite, which were not detected at the short-term experiment site. Integrated K fertilizer and straw return reduced soil bulk density (BD) and degree of anisotropy (DA), increased fractal dimension (FD) and optimized soil pore structure distribution. Nonetheless, continuous sufficient K input raised the amount of total K loss through runoff and leaching. Compared with that of NP treatment, the total K loss of NPK and NPK + ST treatments were increased by 160.3\% and 227.5\%, respectively. This strategy contributed to the conversion of bio-waste into resources, sustainable soil K management and scientific K fertilizer application for agricultural production. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Soil fertility in oil palm agroforestry systems in the {Eastern} {Amazon}, {Brazil
VL  - 97
SN  - NA
AB  - Oil palm agroforestry systems associated with conservation management practices have been proposed as a more sustainable alternative to monoculture. We examined whether oil palm agroforestry systems (less and more diversified) under conservation management contribute to improving soil fertility (an indicator of soil sustainability), using a secondary forest fragment as a reference. We analyzed the effects of the agroforestry systems and the secondary forest on the following variables in the arable layer (0â€“20 cm) and in the layers along the soil profile (0â€“5, 5â€“10, 10â€“20, and 20â€“30 cm): active acidity (pH), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), aluminum (Al), organic matter, potential acidity (H + Al), potential cation-exchange capacity (CEC), effective cation-exchange capacity (ECEC), Al saturation (AS), and base saturation (BS). Overall, soil acidity was lower in the agroforestry systems than in the forest, in all layers. In the arable layer, the pH, Ca, Mg, K, P, and BS values were higher in the agroforestry systems than in the forest. Liming, inorganic and organic fertilization, and the maintenance of organic matter on the soil may have contributed to improving soil fertility in the oil palm agroforestry systems. Our results suggest that, in the eastern Amazon, oil palm growing in agroforestry systems associated with conservation practices can contribute to the maintenance of soil fertility at adequate levels for the species cultivated in these systems.

VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - A progressive decline in soil fertility in taro (Colocasia esculenta L., Schott) production systems has contributed to reduced crop productivity and farm profitability, and is recognized to be a threat to soil nutrient and food security in Samoa. Evidence based on three years of field experimentation showed that appropriate nutrient budgeting is required to reduce soil nutrient deficits and mitigate soil organic carbon loss. Balanced crop nutrition coupled with appropriate crop husbandry can significantly improve productivity and narrow yield gaps. A framework to guide nutrient recommendations for taro production systems is presented and discussed. This framework proposes that recommendations for N be derived from the yield-to-N response function (from which the most economic rate of N can be estimated) and that for other nutrients, namely P, K, Ca, and Mg, recommendations be based on replacement. The replacement strategy requires the development of soil nutrient indexes, which can be used to define the long-term nutrient management policy at the field scale. This long-term policy is informed by soil analyses, and it will determine whether existing soil nutrient levels are to be maintained or increased depending on the focus (productivity, profitability, environmental protection). If soil nutrients were already at an agronomically satisfactory level, their application may be omitted in some years to help reduce crop production costs, improve use efficiency, and ensure environmentally safe levels in soil are not exceeded.

VL  - 71
SN  - NA
AB  - A conservation agriculture (CA)-based study was started during the year 2013 to assess the effect of crop residue (CR) retention and phosphorus (P) fertilization over soil fertility. The experiment was laid out as split-plot design comprising of various CR retention rates viz. No CR, 2 t CR ha-1, 4 t CR ha-1 and 6 t CR ha-1 as main-plot and P-fertilizer doses viz. No P fertilizer, 50\% recommended dose of phosphorus (RDP), 100\% RDP, 150\% RDP and 50\% RDP + arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) + phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) as sub-plots. After completion of five cropping cycles, soil samples were collected for the analysis. Results indicated that soil chemical properties (pH, EC) and nutrients (organic C, available N, P and K) were significantly influenced by both CR retention and P-fertilization. These properties were recorded highest under 6 t CR ha-1 that was at par with 4 t CR ha-1 except for available nitrogen (N) that was highest in case of 4 t CR ha-1 . Furthermore, P-fertilizer treatment 50\% RDP+ AM + PSB was found to be at par with 100\% RDP. Hence, CR retention @ 4 t ha-1 and P-fertilizer supplemented with AM and PSB was found to be beneficial in reducing the P-fertilizer rate and maintenance of soil fertility under CA based cropping system.

VL  - 12

AB  - Soil fertility (SF) assessment is an important strategy for identifying agriculturally productive lands, particularly in areas that are vulnerable to climate change. This research focuses on detecting SF zones in Firozabad district, Uttar Pradesh, India, for agricultural purposes, so that they can be prioritized for future management using the fuzzy technique in the Arc GIS model-builder. The model computing technique was also deployed to determine the different fertility zones, considering 17 soil parameters. The derived fuzzy technique outperformed the traditional method of dividing the sampling sites into clusters to correlate soil fertility classes with the studied soil samples. The prioritization of the soil factors and a spatial analysis of the fertility areas were carried out using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and GIS tools, respectively. The AHP analysis outcome indicated that hydraulic properties had the highest weighted value, followed by physical and chemical properties, regarding their influence on SF. The spatial distribution map of physico-chemical properties also clearly depicts the standard classification. A fuzzy priority map was implemented based on all the classes parameters to identify the five fertility classes of the soil, namely very high (0.05\%); high (16.59\%); medium (60.94\%); low (22.34\%); and very low (0.07\% of total area). This study will be of significant value to planners and policymakers in the future planning and development of activities and schemes that aim to solve similar problems across the country.

TI  - Evaluation of soil moisture estimation techniques based on {Sentinel}-1 observations over wheat fields
VL  - 287
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in agriculture and its monitoring is essential. SM determines the amount of water available to plants, having a direct impact on the development of crops, on the forecasting of crop yields and on the surveillance of food security. Microwave remote sensing offers a great potential for estimating SM because it is sensitive to the dielectric characteristics of observed surface that depend on surface soil moisture. The objective of this study is the evaluation of three change detection methodologies for SM estimation over wheat at the agricultural field scale based on Sentinel-1 time series: Short Term Change Detection (STCD), TU Wien Change Detection (TUWCD) and Multitemporal Bayesian Change Detection (MTBCD). Different methodological alternatives were proposed for the implementation of these techniques at the agricultural field scale. Soil moisture measurements from eight experimental wheat fields were used for validating the methodologies. All available Sentinel-1 acquisitions were processed and the eventual benefit of correcting for vegetation effects in backscatter time series was evaluated. The results were rather variable, with some experimental fields achieving successful performance metrics (ubRMSE âˆ¼ 0.05 m3/m3) and some others rather poor ones (ubRMSE {\textgreater} 0.12 m3/m3). Evaluating median performance metrics, it was observed that both TUWCD and MTBCD methods obtained better results when run with vegetation corrected backscatter time series (ubRMSE âˆ¼0.07 m3/m3) whereas STCD produced similar results with and without vegetation correction (ubRMSE âˆ¼0.08 m3/m3). The soil moisture content had an influence on the accuracy of the different methodologies, with higher errors observed for drier conditions and rain-fed fields, in comparison to wetter conditions and irrigated fields. Taking into account the spatial scale of this case study, results were considered promising for the future application of these techniques in irrigation management. Â© 2023 The Authors

TI  - Integrated rice-aquatic animals culture systems promote the sustainable development of agriculture by improving soil fertility and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
VL  - 299
SN  - NA
AB  - Context: Integrated riceâ€“aquatic animals culture systems (RACSs) are of interest in sustainability research because they have been found to host diverse species and there is potential for positive synergistic effects between the plant (rice) and aquatic animal culture. However, their effect on soil fertility, rice productivity, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the associations among them, remain unclear. Objectives: A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the sustainability of RACSs from the perspective of â€œrice productivityâ€“GHG emissionsâ€“soil fertilityâ€ and their associations and to clarify how environmental factors and fertilizer-management practices affect responses of rice yield and GHG emissions to RACSs. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 1807 paired observations collected from 78 published papers covering four countries that compared soil fertility, rice yield, and GHG emissions in a conventional rice monoculture system (CRMS) and in a RACS. Results: Overall, the RACSs improved soil structure (soil bulk density declined by 5.8 \% and total and capillary porosity increased by 6.4 \% and 5.7 \%, respectively), increased soil organic carbon (C, 7.9 \%) and nitrogen (N, 6.6 \%) storage, and reduced CH4 (9.2 \%) and N2O (4.5 \%) emissions; rice yield were little higher (by 2.0 \%) than that of the CRMS. However, the effects varied under different RACS modes, environmental factors, and fertilizer-management practices. For instance, compared to CRMS, yields were 4.1 \% higher in the riceâ€“duck mode, 3.9 \% lower in the riceâ€“crayfish mode, and the no significantly change in the riceâ€“fish system. The effects on GHG emissions and soil fertility were more pronounced in the riceâ€“duck and riceâ€“crayfish modes than in the riceâ€“fish mode. Furthermore, paddy soils with low fertility (lower soil organic C and N) and less nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) input provide a higher rice yield and lower GHG emissions under RACSs. Conclusions: Overall, the RACSs stabilized rice productivity and reduced GHG emissions by improving the soil structure and increasing soil C and N sequestration; however, the effects varied by different RACS modes, initial soil properties, fertilizer input rate, and climate conditions. As such, environmental factors and nutrient management should be considered when designing and deciding what type of RACSs to employ. Our results also highlight the great potential of RACSs in the development of sustainable agriculture practices in the context of climate change. Implications: Future research and applications should consider the response of RACSs to climate and environmental factors and fertilizer-management practices, to achieve greater production and environmental benefits.

TI  - Plant {Growth} and {Soil} {Water} {Content} {Changes} under {Different} {Inter}-{Row} {Soil} {Management} {Methods} in a {Sloping} {Vineyard
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate soilâ€“plantâ€“water interactions based on field measurements of plant reflectance and soil water content (SWC) in different inter-row managed sloping vineyards. The following three different soil management applications were studied: tilled (T), cover crops (CC), and permanent grass (NT) inter-rows. We measured SWCs within the row and between rows of vines. Each investigated row utilized 7 to 10 measurement points along the slope. Topsoil SWC and temperature, leaf NDVI and chlorophyll concentrations and leaf area index (LAI) were measured every two weeks over the vegetation period (May to November) using handheld instruments. We found that management method and slope position can significantly affect the soilâ€™s physical and chemical properties, such as clay or soil organic carbon contents. Cover crops in the inter-row significantly reduced average SWC. The in-row average topsoil SWCs and temperatures were lower in all study sites compared to the values measured in between rows. Significantly higher SWCs were observed for the upper points compared to the lower ones for CC and T treatments (58.0 and 60.9\%, respectively), while the opposite was noted for NT. Grassed inter-row grapevines had significantly lower leaf chlorophyll content than the other inter-row managed sites (p {\textless} 0.001). The highest average leaf chlorophyll contents were observed in the T vineyard (16.89 CCI). Based on slope positions, the most distinguishable difference was observed for the CC: 27.7\% higher chlorophyll values were observed at the top of the slope compared to the grapevine leaves at the bottom of the slope (p {\textless} 0.01). The leaf NDVI values were not as profoundly influenced by slope position in the vineyard as the chlorophyll values were. For overall LAI values, the T treatment had significantly lower values compared to NT and CC (p {\textless} 0.001). Moderate correlations were observed between NDVI and LAI and soil nitrogen and carbon content. In general, we found that both inter-row management and slope position can significantly influence soil parameters and affect plant growth, and consequently can accelerate plant stress under sub-optimal environmental conditions such as prolonged drought.

AB  - Background: Soil nutrients are the major source of plant nutrition that helps for the plant growth. Soil resource is currently facing threats due to various soil nutrients deficiency. Assessing the spatial variability of soil nutrients quality is necessary for agriculture. Quickly and efficiently monitoring soil nutritional status using remote sensing technology is of great significance for farmland soil productivity, food security and sustainable agricultural development. Methods: The present study focuses on spatial variability of soil quality. Current research has been conducted to estimate and map soil nutrient contents in large areas using GIS technology and other related maps were prepared from remote sensing data in ArcGIS 10.1. 288 soil samples were collected for the study from different Blocks of the Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu. The Organic carbon, N, P, K, pH and EC status of the soil were analysed and reported. Result: The organic carbon status of the soil is very low in most of the parts of Coimbatore and the pH status is slightly alkaline. The primary nutrients N, P and K were found to be low and found to have micronutrient imbalance which is highly influenced by the changes in pH. Â© 2023, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture profile sensors (SMPSs) have a high potential for climate-smart agriculture due to their easy handling and ability to perform simultaneous measurements at different depths. To date, an accurate and easy-to-use method for the evaluation of long SMPSs is not available. In this study, we developed laboratory and field experiments to evaluate three different SMPSs (SoilVUE10, Drill\&Drop, and SMT500) in terms of measurement accuracy, sensor-to-sensor variability, and temperature stability. The laboratory experiment features a temperature-controlled lysimeter to evaluate intra-sensor variability and temperature stability of SMPSs. The field experiment features a water level-controlled sandbox and reference TDR measurements to evaluate the soil water measurement accuracy of the SMPS. In both experiments, a well-characterized fine sand was used as measurement medium to ensure homogeneous dielectric properties in the measurement domain of the sensors. The laboratory experiments with the lysimeter showed that the Drill\&Drop sensor has the highest temperature sensitivity with a decrease of 0.014 m3 mâˆ’3 per 10 Â°C, but at the same time showed the lowest intra- and inter-sensor variability. The field experiment with the sandbox showed that all three SMPSs have a similar performance (average RMSE â‰ˆ 0.023 m3 mâˆ’3) with higher uncertainties at intermediate soil moisture contents. The presented combination of laboratory and field tests were found to be well suited to evaluate the performance of SMPSs and will be used to test additional SMPSs in the future.

TI  - Organic and inorganic fertilizers combined with a water-saving technique increased soil fertilities and apple production in a rainfed hilly orchard
VL  - 414
SN  - NA
AB  - A high and stable apple yield is critical for rainfed hilly apple orchards; however, many factors threaten apple yield and sustainable apple production, including water shortage, soil erosion, and chemical fertilizer overuse. Therefore, we undertook a field trial with three treatmentsâ€” (1) organic and inorganic fertilizer combining a water-saving technique (OIWS), (2) inorganic fertilizer combining a water-saving technique (IWS), and (3) inorganic fertilizer alone (CK)â€”to determine how to alleviate these yield-limiting factors and improve soil fertility. Averaged across five years (2016â€“2020), the OIWS treatment increased apple yield the most, by 24.87\% and 67.34\% relative to IWS and CK, respectively. The OIWS treatment also had the highest apple yield stability, despite no significant differences between treatments, indicating OIWS treatment could produce higher apple yield year by year relative to IWS and CK. In comparison to IWS and CK, OIWS treatment showed greater 0â€“1 m by 12.21\% and 26.08\% and 0â€“3 m soil water storage (SWS) by 14.81\% and 19.12\%, as well as the highest abundance of 0â€“1 m soil microaggregates (0.053â€“0.2 mm) and macroaggregates (0.2â€“2 mm). Moreover, relative to IWS and CK averaged across the five years and 0â€“2 m soil layers, OIWS treatment substantially enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) by 4.23 and 3.93 g kgâˆ’1 and total nitrogen (TN) by 0.09 and 0.11 g kgâˆ’1, respectively. Furthermore, Changes in apple production were positively linked with variations in 0â€“1 m SWS, soil microaggregate and macroaggregate abundance, and SOC and TN. And the most relevant factor to apple yield is 0â€“1 m SWS. Overall, on the Loess Plateau, OIWS system is a sustainable approach for increasing apple productivity and soil fertilities in rainfed hilly orchards. Â© 2023

TI  - Soil moisture content-based analysis of terrestrial ecosystems in {China}: {Water} use efficiency of vegetation systems
VL  - 150
SN  - NA
AB  - Water is a prerequisite for the formation of earth-biochemical-ecological systems. Differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources are important factors in the formation of differences in the distribution of vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems and are key to the differences in vegetation productivity. Vegetation water use efficiency is calculated by the total amount of fixed biogenic carbon per unit mass of water consumed in photosynthesis and can be used to assess the intensity and capacity of an ecosystem to use water biomass. Based on remote satellite sensing data, this study proposes a new water use efficiency assessment model. The model was validated using flux site data, and we analyzed the relative contribution of climate factors to soil moisture use efficiency using a first-difference method. The results revealed the following: (1) The soil moisture use efficiencies (SUE) of remote sensing data inversions that were evaluated using flux site data based on correlation coefficients and Nash coefficients showed high reliability, and only the NMG (Inner Mongolia) station showed low correlation among the nine sites. (2) Among the nine agricultural sub-regions in China, only the SUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region showed a decreasing trend (âˆ’1.08 g C/mâˆ’2 kg H2O yr), while all other regions showed an increasing trend. (3) The highest vegetation soil moisture use efficiency (1.83 g C/mâˆ’2 kg H2O) was found in ferralisols, while the lowest vegetation SUE (0.17 g C/mâˆ’2 kg H2O) was found in arid soils. The SUE of different vegetation types showed the characteristics of forest {\textgreater} scrub {\textgreater} cultivated vegetation {\textgreater} wetland {\textgreater} grassland. (4) The relative contribution of gross primary productivity (GPP) to the change in SUE was 37.53\%, while the relative contribution of soil moisture content to the change in SUE was âˆ’26.71\%. Among the five climatic factors, temperature was the most dominant factor affecting the change in SUE, followed by precipitation, net radiation, leaf area index, and potential evapotranspiration. Revealing the relationship between terrestrial ecosystem GPP, soil moisture content, and their responses to climate factors is a prerequisite for understanding the adaptation strategies of regional terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change, which can help to inform decision-making for the sustainable development of ecosystems.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - During the summers of 2021 and 2022, we conducted a study in four Georgia Piedmont pastures to assess the effect of the presence of filth flies and epigeal arthropods on carbon and nitrogen emissions and soil nitrogen retention from lax rotational grazing systems under a legacy of low fertilization. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3) emissions were measured from dung on days 0, 4, 8, and 15 following depositions. Soil and manure samples were collected on days 0 and 16 and analyzed for ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3âˆ’), plant-available nitrogen (PAN), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN). Manure samples were analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). The numbers of filth flies ovipositing and emerging from manure, fire ants, and epigeal arthropods around the manure were determined. Our results indicated that more than 12 ovipositing filth flies per manure pat can reduce PMN by up to 14.7 kg of nitrogen per hectare, while an increase in the biodiversity and abundance of predators may help to increase PAN and PMN in grazing systems, as well as decrease the number of emerging filth flies.

TI  - A twenty-year dataset of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth from {AMSR}-{E}/2 measurements using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm
VL  - 292
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) are essential variables in the terrestrial ecosystem. The multi-frequency radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 provide {\textgreater}20 years of data records, enabling the development of long-term SM and VOD products. Most of the current retrieval algorithms either only focus on SM or VOD, and generally ignore the polarization or simplify the frequency dependence of vegetation effects for reducing the unknowns and facilitating the retrieval process, limiting the synergic applicability of VOD and SM products in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. In this study, a new global SM and frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD product from 2002 to 2021 was developed using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA), based on the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency passive microwave measurements. The MCCA algorithm comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD while considering the accuracy of the SM retrievals. In the overall comparison with other SM products (AMSR-ANN, CCI-passive v07.1, LPRM-C/X, JAXA) over 25 dense SM networks, MCCA achieved the best scores in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 0.074 m3/m3), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.073 m3/m3) and bias (0.007 m3/m3), and presented slightly lower value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R = 0.709) than LPRM-X (R = 0.735). For the indirect evaluation of VOD with aboveground biomass (AGB) and MODIS NDVI, the MCCA product showed the performance comparable to other products (LPRM-C/X, VODCA-C/X/Ku). MCCA-derived VODs, especially for the H-polarized VODs, exhibited smooth non-linear density distribution with AGB and high temporal correlations with MODIS NDVI over most regions of the globe. In particular, MCCA-derived VODs can physically present reasonable variations across the microwave spectrum (values of VOD increase with microwave frequency), which is superior to the LPRM and VODCA products. It is expected that the MCCA algorithm can be extended to the observations of the ongoing AMSR2 or other similar satellite missions with multi-frequency capability, such as FY-3B/C/D/F/G or the upcoming AMSR3 and CMIR missions.

TI  - Response of {Rice} {Grain} {Yield} and {Soil} {Fertility} to {Fertilization} {Management} under {Three} {Rice}-{Based} {Cropping} {Systems} in {Reclaimed} {Soil
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Reasonable cropping systems and fertilizer management are vital for improving the quality of barren soil. The effectiveness of different crop rotation methods and fertilizers in soil improvement depends on various factors, including soil type, climate conditions, and crop type. In the present study, based on three rice-based cropping systems, the effects of organic fertilizers combined with slow-release fertilizers on rice yield and soil fertility in reclaimed soil were analyzed. The results showed that the rice grain yield was highest under the rice-fallow rotation system (RF) with the application of rapeseed meal fertilizer. Available nutrients such as AN, N\_NH4+, TP, and AK showed a significant positive correlation with rice grain yield (p {\textless} 0.05). PCA and PERMANOVA analysis supported significant variation in CAZyme abundance among cropping systems (R2 = 0.60, p = 0.001) and significant differences between slow-release fertilizer treatments and organic fertilizer treatments (p {\textless} 0.05), but not among the three organic fertilizer treatments. Network analysis indicated positive stronger correlations among all functional enzymes in organic fertilizer treatments compared to chemical fertilizer treatments. RDA and correlation heat map results showed that C/N ratios and N\_NH4+ were strongly related to CAZyme composition. PLS-PM analysis revealed that soil available nitrogen positively influenced several variables, while rice grain yield was negatively influenced by soil enzymes and TOC. These findings suggested that under appropriate cropping systems, partially substituting chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers can effectively enhance the availability of nutrients in the soil, alter the activity of carbon-cycling microorganisms, and increase rice grain yield.

TI  - Yield potential of site-specific integrated pest and soil nutrient management at different harvest intervals under two commercial cocoa planting systems in {Malaysia
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatio-temporal variability of soil fertility and cocoa pod borer (CPB) infestation rate provides strategic information about the soil nutrients and CPB population densities at different harvest intervals. This enables the transitioning of cocoa fields (cooca-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut) from conventional to modern precision management. Geostatistical methods were applied to interpolate the data collected from a systematic grid based on a cluster of six cocoa tree stands for both fields and produce maps representing the spatial variability of all soil variables and CPB attack. Cocoa fresh bean weight and CPB infestation data were collected at two week-intervals from cocoa-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut. All field data points were geo-referenced by a differential global positioning system. Data were processed for possible outliers, and analysed by variography and interpolation techniques for quantification of spatial variability. Results showed that both plots exhibited definable spatial structures and were described by exponential models. Precision cocoa management recorded an increase in crop yield by 52.8 and 37.5\% at cocoa-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut, respectively. Site-specific nutrient management and integrated pest control in the critical zones showed improvement in cocoa yields, especially during the peak harvest season.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are primary indicators of soil nutrients in agriculture. Accurate management of these nutrients is essential for ensuring food security. High-resolution, multi-spectral remote sensing images can provide crucial information for mapping soil nutrients at the field scale. This study compares the capabilities of ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with different spectral indices, in mapping soil nutrients (total N and Olsen-P) using two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). Two agricultural fields in Suihua City were selected as the study areas for this investigation. The results showed that Sentinel-2 data performed best in computing the total N content in soil using the RF model (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.10 g/kg). However, for the soil Olsen-P content, the XGBoost model performed better with ZH-1 data (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 9.79 mg/kg) than the RF model. This study demonstrates that both ZH-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data perform well in terms of accurately mapping soil total N and Olsen-P contents using machine learning. Due to its higher spectral and spatial resolution, ZH-1 remote sensing data provides more detailed information on soil nutrient content during Olsen-P inversion and exhibits comparable accuracy.

TI  - Legume-bacteria-soil interaction networks linked to improved plant productivity and soil fertility in intercropping systems
VL  - 196
SN  - NA
AB  - Intercropping with legumes is an effective strategy to increase plant productivity, reduce nitrogen (N) inputs, and maintain soil fertility in an industrial monoculture forest. However, the facilitation/complementarity mechanism of the interactions between legumes (keystone species in intercropping), bacteria and soil are still unknown, and the contribution of this triple interaction to plant growth and ecosystem function is still difficult to predict. Taking the introduction of Dalbergia odorifera (D. odorifera), into eucalyptus plantations as an example, we evaluated the changes in nutrient uptake, phytohormone contents, N metabolism-related enzyme activities, and root-associated bacteria of D. odorifera under different N applications (0, 3, 6 and 12 g potâˆ’1) and different planting patterns (monoculture and intercropping), and investigated the regulatory mechanism of these cascaded changes on productivity and soil fertility in response to intercropping. The results showed that intercropping increased the total biomass by 5.90â€“56.29\% compared to monoculture; in particular, intercropping in combination with 6 g N potâˆ’1 had superiority in promoting the gibberellin content, glutamine synthetase activity, nitrogenase activity, soil fertility, and bacterial diversity, as well as the relative abundance of bacteria with the potential to undergo aerobic chemoheterotrophy, N fixation and N respiration. The differentially expressed genes identified via transcriptome analysis were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, signal transduction, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To integrate the associations between plant traits, bacterial communities, and soil properties, we built a multivariable network based on multiple plant traits, soil properties, differentially accumulated genera, and differentially expressed genes in monoculture and intercropping. These results led to the identification of candidates related to intercropping advantages, including two genes (acidic endo chitinase, Na+/K+ transporter) and four bacterial genera (Bacteroides, Coxiella, Pseudomonas, SJA-15). More specifically, moderate fertilization of eucalyptus/D. odorifera intercropping systems create a more stable interaction network with additional module hubs. These results highlight the importance of bacterial diversity and the plant-bacteria-soil interaction network in maintaining soil fertility and plant productivity, which may help fertilization practices in eucalyptus plantations and provide guidance for the ecological sustainability of introducing D. odorifera into industrial forests.

TI  - Intercropping systems between broccoli and fava bean can enhance overall crop production and improve soil fertility
VL  - 312
SN  - NA
AB  - Legumes can be regarded as a good alternative in intercropping systems to increase soil fertility and biodiversity whilst enhancing crop production and reducing fertilizer use. The aims of this study were to: i) assess whether crop yield, crop quality and soil physicochemical properties can be improved using different intercropping patterns between broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica) and fava bean (Vicia faba) compared with their respective monocrops, all grown under organic management; and ii) assess if fava bean grown as an intercrop can partially replace fertilizer use without negative effects on crop production. We compared, for three crop cycles, monocrops with three different broccoli-fava intercropping patterns: mixed intercropping, row intercropping 1:1 (broccoli:fava), and row intercropping 2:1 (broccoli:fava). Fertilization was reduced by 30\% in the diversified plots. After three crop cycles, the results showed that the intercropping systems, regardless of the pattern, kept soil organic C levels, while they significantly decreased in broccoli monoculture. Intercropping also significantly increased soil total N, available P and exchangeable K (0.13\%, 39 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1 and 364 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1, respectively), compared to the broccoli monocrop (0.11\%, 11 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1 and 277 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1). Total production was significantly higher under the diversified systems, which doubled the overall yield of the monocrops every crop cycle, with land equivalent ratios {\textgreater} 1. Hence, the introduction of fava bean associated to broccoli could be considered a feasible strategy for sustainable agriculture, with environmental gains and economic savings for fertilizers and water.

VL  - 36
SN  - NA
AB  - Maintenance of soil fertility and improvement of soil health are indispensable to obtain better crop productivity. Various research institutions in Pakistan have developed, and promoted several technologies for sustainable soil management and to improve crop productivity. These technologies include use of micronutrients for citrus fruits and their application for off-season vegetables, use of Biozote for wheat crop, and Pak Seeder technology for sowing wheat crop by zero-till method. Keeping this in view, economic viabilities of these technologies have been determined through marginal analysis. Unfortunately, Pak-seeder technology could not be demonstrated effectively due to few institutional and technical limitations. Thus, technical issues in its manufacturing as well as its use are highlighted. The study is based on the outcomes of six demonstration sites of micronutrientsâ€™ use for citrus and thirteen sites for vegetablesâ€™ production in tunnels viz. chili peppers, bell peppers, cucumber and bottle gourds, twenty Biozote technology sites for wheat crop, and six Pak Seeder technology sites for planting wheat. Use of micronutrients resulted in better fruit setting and productivity in citrus by 12.5 percent and 15.0 percent, respectively. Sample farmers reported that use of the technology resulted in premium prices of the produce by ten percent. Benefit cost ratio of micronutrients use for citrus orchards was 5.71. Use of micronutrients for off-season vegetables resulted into even better gains; increased productivity of chili pepper, cucumber, bottle gourd and bell papers by 31.9, 40.6, 29.9 and 11.1 percent; with benefit cost ratios of 28.1, 17.4, 15.0 and 11.4, respectively. Similarly, application of Biozote for wheat production increased the productivity by 10.8 percent, with a benefit cost ratio of 8.2. Extensive dissemination and demonstration of these economically viable technologies for their speedy adoption is need of the hour. Similarly, there is a need to improve farmersâ€™ access to these technologies for large-scale adoption. Â© 2023 by the authors. Licensee ResearchersLinks Ltd, England, UK.

TI  - Assessment of five {SMAP} soil moisture products using {ISMN} ground-based measurements over varied environmental conditions
VL  - 619
SN  - NA
AB  - Since the launch of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission in 2015, several advanced global surface soil moisture (SM) products derived from different retrieval schemes have been released. However, the factors contributing to the performance differences of these SMAP products have not been fully investigated. This study tries to fill the gap by assessing and intercomparing five SMAP products, namely, the single channel algorithm V/H-pol (SCA-V/H), dual channel algorithm (DCA), multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA) and the new SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB), using the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) ground measurements worldwide during 2016â€“2020. After reviewing the retrieval algorithms, the impact of five potential perturbing factors on the skills of all products is reported; these factors including mean surface soil temperature (MSST), surface roughness (log(SR)), vegetation density (characterized by vegetation optical depth (VOD)), mean surface soil wetness (MSSM) and soil organic matter (SOM). Results shows that the SMAP-IB product has the highest overall R value of 0.75 with ISMN ground SM, and the smallest unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD) values same as SCA-V and DCA (âˆ¼0.058 m3/m3). The performance of all five products in terms of R and ubRMSD rapidly degrades over the regions with high VOD, rough surface and low MSST. In contradiction with the fact that product performance degrades with increasing roughness, the ubRMSD of all five products increases with decreasing log(SR) on a relatively smooth surface (log(SR) {\textless} 6) with larger growth rates for SMAP-IB, SCA-H and MT-DCA. Regarding characterizing the temporal variations of in situ SM anomalies (Ranom), Ranom increases as the ground becomes wet for all products within a certain range (MSSM {\textless} 0.3 m3/m3). In particular, SMAP-IB and MT-DCA present higher Ranom values than the other three products under wet soil surfaces (MSSM {\textgreater} 0.3 m3/m3). The two metrics R and Ranom decrease significantly with increasing SOM for SMAP-IB compared to the other products, and SMAP-IB obtains the lowest values for both metrics when SOM {\textgreater} 20\%. These findings are expected to provide useful information for appropriate product selection and improvement. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - A new method for monitoring the landslide percusor by soil moisture changes from closure phases is studied. The closure phases are created with an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) dataset of triple pairs of interferometric phases. A closure phase of zero suggests no change, whereas a non-zero means change. Then, the decorrelation phases derived from the closure phases were separated by solving the linear programming (LP) convex problem. The decorrelation phase is linked to the soil moisture change. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated with the 2018 Baige landslide event and analysis of multi-temporal Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) datasets. There was a drastic change in soil moisture before sliding. Thus, a new choice is provided for identifying potential landslide precursors by analyzing soil moisture changes.

SN  - NA
AB  - The use of electronic sensors to track the nutrients in the soil is an interesting tool for farmers. This has led to the sale of many different kinds of electronic sensors with different levels of accuracy. The accuracy of this electronic sensor was figured out by comparing the results of the sensorâ€™s measurements with the results of lab tests done in different ways. This study compares the accuracy of electronic devices used to measure soil nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, electrical conductivity, water pH, and humidity to measurements made in the lab using the ICP-OES (Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy) method. We used three electronic sensors and a transmission system based on LoRA (Long Range) to measure the nutrients in the soil and put the results on our website. The similarities between electronic sensors and laboratory test parameters include the standard deviation, accuracy value, and correlation test between sensors and from the sensors to laboratory test results. The standard deviation parameter test showed a big value between the electronic sensor and the lab test results. However, none of the three used electronic sensors had a standard deviation number that differed greatly from the others. Except for the pH value of the soil, the electronic sensorâ€™s accuracy tests for the other five parameters were not very good compared to the lab tests. Also, the sensor correlation test showed a high correlation, while the correlation test between sensor data and lab test results showed a low correlation.

AB  - The agriculture sector accounts for 80\% of the total freshwater resource use in the Philippines. With increasing competition for the scarce water supply, it is necessary to utilize water resources efficiently. The application of smart irrigation technology can help achieve higher water use efficiency, increase farm water productivity, and maximize crop yield. To minimize excess or insufficient irrigation water application to crops, and provide more effective and efficient water management, an integrated water monitoring system called Water Advisory for Irrigation Scheduling System (WAISS) was developed. The performance of WAISS was initially evaluated by comparing the soil moisture measurements of its capacitance soil moisture sensor with a commercially developed sensor and the standard gravimetric method. Statistical analysis shows that the low-cost WAISS soil moisture sensors are comparable with the commercially developed sensors with a Percent Error of 5.5\% compared to METER ECH2O EC-5's 16.1\%. This highlights WAISS' potential as a cost-effective yet reliable alternative for soil moisture monitoring. Â© 2023, University of the Philippines at Los Banos. All rights reserved.

TI  - Deep {LSTM} model exploiting optical sensors for soil nutrient prediction
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Artificial intelligence is a quickly expanding field incorporated into nearly every human life aspect. There is an enormous requirement for influential and speedy measurement systems to calculate precise macronutrients in soil, wherein fertiliser application can be spatially regulated concerning crop demand. However, there is a need to develop a potential avenue for research to design a highly developed model to forecast soil properties. For precise and speedy monitoring of soil macronutrients, a portable sensor device is an essential requirement of an agriculture system. Thus, soil nutrients recognised from gathered soil samples by optical sensors are estimated for their accuracy by the deep learning approach in this work. The deep long short-term memory (LSTM) model is utilised for prediction of soil nutrients following augmenting collected soil data. From investigational analysis, it is revealed that deep LSTM model gained least MSE value of 9.106 eâ€“06, least RMSE value of 0.00301, low MAE value of 0.0008 and low MAPE value of 0.0017.

TI  - Soil phosphorus drawdown by perennial bioenergy cropping systems in the {Midwestern} {US
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated. We analyzed phosphorus (P) inputs (fertilization and atmospheric deposition) and outputs (harvest and leaching losses) over 7 years in three representative biomass cropsâ€”switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus Ã— giganteus) and hybrid poplar trees (Populus nigra Ã— P. maximowiczii)â€”as well as in no-till corn (maize; Zea mays L.) for comparison, all planted on former cropland in SW Michigan, USA. Only corn received P fertilizer. Corn (grain and stover), switchgrass, and miscanthus were harvested annually, while poplar was harvested after 6 years. Soil test P (STP; Bray-1 method) was measured in the upper 25 cm of soil annually. Harvest P removal was calculated from tissue P concentration and harvest yield (or annual woody biomass accrual in poplar). Leaching was estimated as total dissolved P concentration in soil solutions sampled beneath the rooting depth (1.25 m), combined with hydrological modeling. Fertilization and harvest were by far the dominant P budget terms for corn, and harvest P removal dominated the P budgets in switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar, while atmospheric deposition and leaching losses were comparatively insignificant. Because of significant P removal by harvest, the P balances of switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar were negative and corresponded with decreasing STP, whereas P fertilization compensated for the harvest P removal in corn, resulting in a positive P balance. Results indicate that perennial crop harvest without P fertilization removed legacy P from soils, and continued harvest will soon draw P down to limiting levels, even in soils once heavily P-fertilized. Widespread cultivation of bioenergy crops may, therefore, alter P balances in agricultural landscapes, eventually requiring P fertilization, which could be supplied by P recovery from harvested biomass.

AB  - Water is recognized as a generally available and inexhaustible element of our lives and sustainable water management on a global scale is a strategic challenge for mankind. This is especially true of water in the soil, the presence of which determines the nutrition of the population and has an impact on the climate. Monitoring of soil moisture is necessary for optimal irrigation and the development of a schedule of agrotechnical treatments. Currently, the development of numerous sensors for electromagnetic measurement of soil moisture is being observed, the response to the given excitation of which depends on the dielectric properties of the soil. These properties depend on the measurement frequency used and the physical properties of the soil. The work presents the latest apparatus and methodological solutions of contacting electromagnetic sensors for determining soil moisture, developed with the participation of interdisciplinary scientists.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Assessing and monitoring the soil fertility level relies on the crucial factor of soil water content, as it helps prevent late detection of water deficit, which could lead to crop failure. A cost-effective and efficient method to measure soil water content has been proposed in this research which using microstrip antenna as indirect measurement. The findings indicate that microstrip antenna have potential to serve as highly sensitivities sensors to precisely measure soil water content by analyze the electric characteristic of the soil, dielectric permittivity. As further investigation, it is essential to established connection between dielectric permittivity and the antenna parameter, specifically the resonant frequency. This research has successfully extracted a formula by examining the relationship between both parameters, enabling the estimation of soil water content percentage. This paper shows that extraction formula can be obtained by considering theoretical approaches, numerical results and the discrepancies between them. The research demonstrates the proposed microstrip antenna sensor and derived extraction formulation can achieve accurate detection of soil water content. Â© 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Prediction of soil nutrient is one of the important primary input management systems to increase crop yield. The nutrient present in the soil plays a major role in the healthy growth of the plants. There are many nutrients present in the soil such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (mg) and Sulphur (S), etc. Farmers do not have sufficient knowledge and information about the nutrient present in the soil. Therefore, they apply a lot of fertilizers in the soil, which causes the unbalanced soil nutrition levels. Hence, the aim this work is to predict the available nutrients in the soil using various Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this work, three macro nutrients namely NPK which are needed for healthy plant growth are focused. Classification algorithms were used for prediction of soil fertility. Among all of these algorithms, Random Forest give the highest accuracy of 84\%. With the results obtained, the model is deployed using web app for recommending fertilizer which is very helpful to the farmers. Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Intercropping system modulated soilâ€“microbe interactions that enhanced the growth and quality of flue-cured tobacco by improving rhizospheric soil nutrients, microbial structure, and enzymatic activities
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - As the promotive/complementary mechanism of the microbeâ€“soilâ€“tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) interaction remains unclear and the contribution of this triple interaction to tobacco growth is not predictable, the effects of intercropping on soil nutrients, enzymatic activity, microbial community composition, plant growth, and plant quality were studied, and the regulatory mechanism of intercropping on plant productivity and soil microenvironment (fertility and microorganisms) were evaluated. The results showed that the soil organic matter (OM), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), the urease activity (UE) and sucrase activity (SC), the diversity, abundance, and total and unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria and fungi as well as plant biomass in T1 (intercropping onion), T2 (intercropping endive), and T3 (intercropping lettuce) treatments were significantly higher than those of the controls (monocropping tobacco). Although the dominant bacteria and fungi at the phylum level were the same for each treatment, LEfSe analysis showed that significant differences in community structure composition and the distribution proportion of each dominant community were different. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes of bacteria and Ascomycota and Basidiomycetes of fungi in T1, T2, and T3 treatments were higher than those of the controls. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested a close relation between soil characteristic parameters and microbial taxa. The correlation analysis between the soil characteristic parameters and the plant showed that the plant biomass was closely related to soil characteristic parameters. In conclusion, the flue-cured tobacco intercropping not only increased plant biomass and improved chemical quality but also significantly increased rhizospheric soil nutrient and enzymatic activities, optimizing the microbial community composition and diversity of rhizosphere soil. The current study highlighted the importance of microbeâ€“soilâ€“tobacco interactions in maintaining plant productivity and provided the potential fertilization practices in flue-cured tobacco production to maintain ecological sustainability.

AB  - Because of its significant absorption power, particularly in the SWIR optical region (e.g., absorption features around 1400 and 1900 nm), water dominates the optical reflectance properties of water-bearing materials. This allows us to study a material's water-related features, such as its moisture content from optical reflectance. In this study, we proposed a framework to estimate soil moisture content from hyperspectral remote sensing data. Validation is performed on Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery and ground-truth data from the Soil Moisture Network database. Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - A comparative study of soil fertility and biota population under organic, semi-organic, and conventional farming system of rice fields in {Giriwoyo} {District}, {Wonogiri} {Regency}, {Indonesia
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Continuous use of chemical fertilizers and farming practices in rice fields would reduce nutrient availability and biota population in the soil. Because soil biological linkages are sensitive to changes in soil function, changes in fauna and microbial populations can affect soil fertility. This study aimed to identify the condition of soil fertility and soil biota under various farming systems, namely organic, semi-organic, and conventional, and find the indicators that determine soil fertility index (SFI) in the research area. This research is a survey with the sampling method was purposive on the Land Mapping Unit (LMU) overlaid with themat-ic maps (land use, soil type, slope, and rainfall). The method analysis of SFI using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and scoring methods were used for the effect of farming systems using One-way, continued by DMRT, and determinant factor using Pearsonâ€™s. Correlation. The results illustrated that soil fertility was a moderate category. The highest SFI was in organic rice fields (0.69), then in semi-organic (0.62), and the lowest fertility was in conventional (0.59). Organic farming also showed the best soil biota conditions (0.27 individuals/liter of earthworms and 0.755 Âµ/g of microbial C biomass) compared to semi-organic (0.15 individuals/liter, 0.508 Âµ/g microbial C biomass) and conventional farming (0.11 individuals/liter, microbial biomass C 0.325 Âµ/g). Soil fertility and soil biota are positively correlated, meaning that the higher the soil fertility, the higher the density of soil biota. The soil indicators most determining fertility are total N, P-available, K-available, CEC, and organic C. Â© 2023, Applied and Natural Science Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Al-Enezy AFM, Zaidan BA, Almehemdi AF, Hussein AA, Salih MAA. 2023. Tillage systems affect soil nitrogen availability and interact growth parameters of different faba bean cultivars. Biodiversitas 24: 5558-5564. A field trial was conducted during the winter season of 2021-2022 in one of the agricultural lands of Hamid Shaban village, which belongs to Abu Ghraib District of Baghdad Province (33Â°17'51.3"N, 44Â°04'55.0"E). The aim of the experiment was to investigate nitrogen availability in two different tillage systems and the growth characteristics of six broad bean varieties on clay-loamy soils. The field trial was triplicated using the Randomized Complete Block (RCBD) method. The first factor was the six broad bean varieties (Turkish, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, American and local), the second factor was the cultivation system Conservation Tiltage (no-till) and the traditional cultivation with a mouldboard plow. The results showed that the availability of nitrogen in the soil in the traditional tillage system corresponds to the superior to conservative tillage systems. Where this gives an average available nitrogen concentration of 23.3 mg kg-1, an increase of 21 in relation to conservation tillage, which resulted in an average concentration of available nitrogen of 19.1 mg kg-1. In addition, all the growth characteristics of the plants favored the traditional agricultural system. In the variety comparison, the Italian variety was characterized by the highest nitrogen content available in the soil of 26.10 mg kg-1 as well as the highest values of plant growth properties among the six varieties.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earthâ€™s water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODISâ€™s image scale (âˆ¼1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14\%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39\% and rESA-CCI (2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014) = 2.23\%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014) Â¼ 2.59\%).

AB  - An analysis of the impedance spectra in the [20 Hz, 10 MHz] range of low-cost sensors for soil moisture, with different soil types (i.e., clay, loam, and clay with the addition of fertilizer) and moisture levels (i.e., volumetric water content 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\% and 30\%) is presented. Two sensing approaches are investigated, using prototype resistive sensors and a commercial capacitive sensor. The obtained results demonstrate that all the measurements are affected by the soil conductivity and thus vary in accordance with the soil type hence, for accurate measurement, the sensors must be appropriately calibrated according to the soil under test. Moreover, the resistive sensor is proved to have satisfactory sensitivity in a greater frequency range with respect to the capacitive device, and this paves the way for possible usage with low-power microcontrollers for the creation of low-cost embedded systems.

AB  - Rice yields are highly dependent on the level of soil fertility in agricultural areas. This condition is also supported because there are no pests that attack rice plants. In addition, the level of soil fertility determines the amount of rice yields for farmers. The level of soil fertility is influenced by several factors such as soil pH level, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Weather that often changes can cause the level of soil fertility to also fluctuate. The level of soil fertility can be better or worse than the previous condition. Excessive solar heat can cause the soil to dry out and the soil temperature to increase so that the level of soil fertility decreases. When it rains, the soil moisture level increases, the soil temperature decreases, and the soil pH decreases. Therefore, we need a device that can monitor the level of soil fertility online and based on the Internet of Things (IoT) during real time weather conditions. The device is equipped with a pH sensor, temperature sensor, and soil moisture sensor. The sensors are connected to a microprocessor to process the measurement data. In the process of sending data, additional equipment is needed to connect the microcontroller to the internet network, so that the data that has been processed by the microprocessor can be sent to the smartphone. The smartphone displays information about the level of soil fertility, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil moisture levels in real time. The online monitoring device has been successfully tested and can help farmers to find out the real-time condition of their agricultural land accurately and quickly. Â© 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Food is the necessity of humans which is in great demand. Agriculture is the major domain and primary source of food. Soil is the main resource for agriculture where the essential nutrients required for plant growth is available. Agriculture has progressed over time with modern technologies and more equipment's have replaced ancient farming methods. There is a great need to manage the amount of fertilizer to be added for every crop. Without soil testing, it is very difficult to ensure the right application of fertilizers for the crop and get the optimum yield. Analyzing soil samples in a laboratory is a time-consuming process that entails numerous steps, such as gathering soil samples, preparing them for analysis, conducting chemical or physical analysis, interpreting the analysis results, and ultimately providing fertilizer recommendations for crops. In this work, soil nutrient prediction system is developed which predicts the Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) values and recommends the crop to be cultivated. In this system, BORUTA regression model gives highest accuracy of 91\%. Python is used to develop this prediction and recommendation system. Â© 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Surface soil moisture plays an important role in agricultural applications such as precipitation, irrigation, and evaporation. Several studies utilized hyper-spectral and multi-spectral sensors to capture images and then extract needed information from pixels. However, these procedures are expensive and have low accuracy since they require extracting information from images indirectly rather than directly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a point sensing system by utilizing a miniaturized spectrometer, which enables proximal sensing benefits for sensing surface soil moisture. We validated our point sensing system by conducting a series of real-world experiments and using the ordinary Kriging method for generating surface soil moisture distributions. Results demonstrated using a spectrometer can acquire spectrum response, and the spectrum absorption magnitude has been revealed at the specific band directly. Surface soil moisture and absorption magnitude have a significant correlation (R2â‰ˆ 0.92) for sensing surface soil moisture. Â© 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Agricultura1 production and ecohydrological processes are strongly influenced by soil moisture dynamics, which is an important hydrological variable. Black soils are known for their fertility, farming suitability, and ability to produce the most. Global black soil areas are mainly located in the Mississippi River Basin of the United States, the Dnieper River Basin of Ukraine, and the Northeast Plain of China. A significant difference in soil moisture can be found in the global black soil area. This is as a result of differences in climate, topography, and production conditions. We can respond to the food crisis triggered by worldwide climate change by understanding black land long-cycle spatio-temporal changes. Due to its all-day, all-weather capabilities and certain penetration properties, microwave remote sensing has become one of the most common methods to invert soil moisture over a large area. Surface water soil moisture parameters are closely related to microwave scattered radiation characteristics of the surface. Microwave signals are more sensitive to soil moisture and have significant advantages over other wavebands. Methods: Based on the VOD vegetation optical thickness data products, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the three major black soil regions in the world from 1990 to 2020. In this study, the Theil-Sen median trend analysis was combined with Mann-Kendall significance tests to examine soil moisture changes in a long-term regional series comprehensively. The trend change patterns of different blacklands and different months were investigated. In addition, we investigated the area and proportion of soil moisture that were relatively stable and highly variable. Using the Hurst index analysis, we discussed future trends in soil moisture changes and their influencing factors. Results: A significant difference existed in the spatial distribution of soil water content in the black soil region of Eurasia. Ukraine's soil water content was generally low, while northern China and eastern Russia's values were higher; Global soil moisture in black soil had not changed significantly in the long-term series, and the overall trend was decreasing, largely due to changes in the northeast; Ukraine had the most stable dynamic change of soil moisture, while the Northeast Plain had relatively strong volatility; There is a possibility that soil moisture will decrease in the future due to the overall trend change in Eurasia. There may be a trend reversal in the 82.9\% area in the future, especially in Northeast China, which may be dominated by a decreasing trend. In general, the soil moisture content was higher than black soil in other parts of the world, but in the savannah ecosystem, the soil moisture content was higher than in any other part of the world. Conclusion: We obtained an international spatial and temporal distribution dataset for soil moisture in major blackland areas during 1990-2020 that will help to assess agricultural policy and ensure food security in the future.

TI  - Diversity of soil fertility management options in maize-based farming systems in northern {Benin}: {A} quantitative survey
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Introduction: Maize-based production systems in Sub-Saharan Africa are largely based on family farming, which is characterized by low-input, nutrient-mining agriculture and practices. These systems usually promote soil degradation through loss of organic matter and erosion. The present study characterizes farms and main soil fertility management options in maize-based farming systems of the northern Benin. Methods: The study was conducted in the municipalities of Malanville, Banikoara and BembÃ¨rÃ¨kÃ¨. We sampled randomly and interviewed 262 maize farmers, and the statistical analysis (distribution of means and frequencies, chi-square, ANOVA, etc.) was performed. Results and discussion: The results show that maize farming characteristics and socioeconomic conditions (land use and labor, production activities and land allocation, institutional arrangements on land, access to labor and capital, etc.) were diverse across locations and exhibited a wide variation within locations. Several practices were used for the management and sustainable maintenance of soil fertility in maize production systems in northern Benin: maize-legume intercropping, cotton-maize rotation, and mineral and organic fertilizers application. Most of farmers occasionally or regularly used mineral fertilizers (95.4\%), followed by legume-cereal rotation/ intercropping (51.9\%). Overall, 23.6\% and 58.4\% of farmers consistently used mineral fertilizer over the last 5 and 10 years, respectively. The amount of applied mineral fertilizer did not significantly vary between locations with an average (applied day after sowing, DAS) of 131.7 Â± 13.7 (22 Â± 8 DAS), 58.7 Â± 9.6 (44 Â± 5 DAS) and 164.7 Â± 25.4 (38 Â± 11 DAS) kg haâˆ’1 for NPK, urea and Mix NPK + urea, respectively applied at, and days after sowing. Most farmers spread the fertilizer around the plants without covering with soil particles. Manure was applied exclusively to food crops through transporting and corralling (28.2\%); and most farmers also used manure from their own livestock while few farmers used cattle corralling. Farmyard manure was mainly spread (100\% of respondents) on the surface before plowing at the beginning of the rainy season. Maize farmers applied mineral fertilizer based on the level of initial soil fertility (naturally fertile or poor, degree of erosion etc.) and fertilizer purchase costs. Manure was not widely used as an alternative to chemical fertilizers; therefore, farmers need more strengthening and technical assistance on the production of organic fertilizers and manure storage. The findings are useful for policymakers on encouraging the successful implementation of sustainable soil fertility management strategies of maize-based farming systems in northern Benin.

AB  - The use of Internet of Things systems may now represent a feasible and real strategy for monitoring soil water content in several engineering fields. Very recently, a low-cost and low-frequency system based on a novel capacitive soil water content measurement has been developed and it is herein presented, as a first application, as a feasible approach in the framework of sustainable precision agriculture. The paper focuses primarily on the capacitive properties of the sensitive element, which makes it possible to measure salinity and volumetric soil water content simultaneously. The system is therefore provided by a customized capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated on the same PCB. Preliminary experimental results on sandy soils characterized by different water contents and conductivities sound rather promising, thus envisaging the possibility of overcoming the known limitations of low-cost sensors for in-situ measurements.

TI  - Integrated soil fertility management practices for improved crop production in smallholder farming systems of semi-arid areas: {A} synthetic review
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility degradation is one of the major constraints in smallholder farming environments especially in the semi-arid region of Sub-Saharan Africa. This has been worsened by poor farming methods, lack of technical knowledge and inadequate application of nutrient sources by farmers. The use of mineral fertiliser alone has been cost ineffective and causes land degradation. Although several soil fertility management (SFM) practices have been put forward, knowledge about their benefits, access and adoption by smallholder farmers is still limited. Synthetic review of published articles obtained from Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus which cover semi-arid regions across Africa were retrieved and synthesied. Farmers have been applying low organic manure ({\textless}5 t haâˆ’1) against the recommended rate of 20â€“40 t haâˆ’1 depending on soil texture and this caused low crop yields. This call for farmers to adopt integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices to improve nutrient availability and crop yields. The use of ISFM has been reported to increase maize yields by 15â€“145\% in semi-arid areas. Maize yields varies from 4200 to 5500 kg haâˆ’1 and sorghum from 690 to 3500 kg haâˆ’1 under ISFM. Yield increment for various crops with the use of cattle manure integrated with other nutrient sources was reported but there are still few studies where effects compost, farmyard manure and poultry manure were combined with inorganic fertiliser were evaluated. Therefore, this review paper seeks to synthesise the effects of ISFM practices available for smallholder farming systems in semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa to improve crop production.

TI  - Retrieval technology of soil moisture content in crops cotton field based on {UAV} hyperspectral data
VL  - 12551
SN  - NA
AB  - With the rapid development of modern agriculture, the traditional agricultural farming model has been unable to meet the requirements of the rapid development of contemporary society for productivity. The monitoring of crop soil moisture content by satellite hyperspectral is limited by the problems of spatial resolution and data source. The rapid development of UAV has made up for the defects of satellite hyperspectral. In this manuscript, the hyperspectral data of UAV is used as the main data source, the measured spectrum of vegetation in cotton field and the measured ground moisture content data are used as auxiliary data. Different vegetation indexes are calculated by using the measured spectral curve on the ground. Meanwhile, the correlation with the measured soil moisture content and vegetation indexes is also analyzed. The quantitative relationship between vegetation canopy spectral information and ground measured soil moisture content is established and the soil moisture content is retrieved through the vegetation canopy spectral information indirectly. In order to optimizing the hyperspectral data of UAV, the regression relationship between the same vegetation index of two data sources is established, and the soil moisture content model constructed by the measured spectral curve vegetation index is applied to the UAV hyperspectral image in order to completing the large-scale spatial inversion mapping of soil water content. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between soil water content and vegetation index as a whole. The correlation between soil moisture content and normalized vegetation index (NDVI), green wave vegetation index (GNDVI), soil regulated vegetation index (OSAVI) and soil ratio vegetation index (SR) reached 0.79, 0.72, 0.73 and 0.84. NDVI and SR are selected to construct the soil moisture content inversion model, and the model determination coefficients are 0.63 and 0.77 respectively. Due to the difference between the vegetation index of ground measured spectrum and hyperspectral data of UAV, the hyperspectral data are optimized through the vegetation index established by ground measured spectrum to realize the inversion mapping of soil moisture content of UAV hyperspectral data.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of soil moisture sensors is a practice applied to improve irrigation water management. ECH2O-5TE sensors are increasingly being used to estimate the volumetric water content (VWC). In view of the importance of the efficient use of these devices, six main factors affecting the accuracy of sensor measurements were studied: soil moisture levels, soil salinity, temperature, organic matter, soil texture, and bulk density. The study showed that the electrical conductivity of the soil and the temperature independently affect the measurements, while the influence of other factors interferes with that of salinity. This study found that the sensor measurements of the VWC were closest to the actual VWC at the soil ECe and temperatures of 2.42 dS mâˆ’1 and 25 Â°C, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.003 and 0.004 m3 mâˆ’3. Otherwise, the measured VWC values of these sensor readouts significantly overestimated the actual VWC, with an increasing soil ECe and/or producing temperatures higher than the stated values, and vice versa. Given the importance of these sensors for obtaining accurate measurements for water management, a simplified empirical equation was derived using the data collected from a wide range of measurements to correct the influences of electrical conductivity and temperature on the measurement accuracy of the sensors, while considering the influence of the soilâ€™s texture. Thus, the following equation was proposed: Ï´va = (Formula presented.). The results concerning the measurement of different VWC levels via these sensors and the proposed L\&O correction equation were compared with the corresponding actual VWC values determined by gravimetric methods. It was found that this empirical equation reduced the differences in the RMSE between the sensor readings for the VWC and the actual VWC from 0.072 and 0.252 to 0.030 and 0.030 m3 mâˆ’3 for 1 and 5 dS mâˆ’1, respectively, with respect to the ECâ€™s influence at 25 Â°C and reduced the RMSE from 0.053 and 0.098 to 0.007 and 0.011 at 3 and 50 Â°C, respectively, regarding the effect of the temperature at EC 2.42 dS mâˆ’1 at different levels of the actual VWC values.

VL  - 17

AB  - Soil fertility is the integrative effect of chemical, physical, and biological soil properties. A modified soil fertility assessment method that adds biological indicators is essential since this indicator is sensitive to dynamic environmental changes and can better represent the reality of soil fertility compared to the conventional method, which only considers chemical soil properties. The research aims to compare the modified and conventional methods in assessing the soil fertility index at various land uses, namely gardens, paddy fields, and moorland, in the Girimarto district, Wonogiri, Indonesia. The collection of soil samples used purposive sampling with three repetitions on 12 land mapping units (LMUs) obtained from an overlay of land use maps, soil type maps, slope gradient maps, and rainfall maps. Soil fertility index (SFI) assessment is based on the Minimum Soil Fertility Indicators (MSFI), which are selected from Pearson correlation, PCA, weight, and score and followed by stepwise regression analysis. The research showed that the modified method represents the soil fertility level better than the conventional one. The soil fertility index on three land uses using the modified method is lower than the conventional method, i.e., between 0.33 to 0.40 and 0.55 to 0.72, respectively. The modified method is more sensitive to dynamic environmental changes due to the contribution of soil biological indicators to the SFI value. Therefore, the biological indicators can represent soil fertility levels closer to reality. Future research needs to validate the modified method in different soil types, land uses, and areas.

SN  - NA
AB  - Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) is a measurement of soil water-retaining ability in unsaturated soil. The unsaturated hydraulic properties are necessary to predict the movement of water in unsaturated soil. The current study aims to create an alternative experimental device to estimate the K using soil moisture sensors. The experimental set up was designed and fabricated in order to measure the volumetric water content using GS3 (Campbell) sensors at different heights. The data obtained from the sensors was validated using mass of moist sand column measured from electronic balance. The K was estimated with the help of retention and conductivity functions. The primary materials used in the study were solute-free water and sand. It was found that the reading from the sensors was in good match with the reading of the volumetric water content calculated from the mass of water in the sand column with a root mean square error of 0.0091. Soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity were plotted using Peters-Durner-Iden (PDI) model. The results were compared to the van Genuchten function. The K prediction was initially equivalent for both models, but the later overpredicts the falling rate of hydraulic conductivity with the increasing soil matric suction before underpredict after 200 cm matric suction on a sandy soil. PDI function was able to extrapolate the hydraulic conductivity film flow region of sandy soil. Â© 2023 UTHM Publisher. All rights reserved.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the major land degradation problems affecting about 932 million hectares (Mha) in the World, and about 6.74 Mha in India. Since soil salinization affects the plant growth which affects agricultural production and food security, it needs to be monitored and managed well. The existing field devices for assessing soil salinity are expensive ({\textgreater} US 150 for the sensor alone). So, a lowcost sensor (about US70) has been designed for assessing soil salinity by measuring soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC). The device uses oscillation frequency shift technique for measuring soil moisture, and electrical resistivity is used for bulk EC measurement. The sensor prototype has been designed and tested using downward infiltration method with 14 soil samples. Regression models have been developed for soil moisture estimation from frequency measurements. Pore water EC has been estimated from bulk EC measurements for determining soil salinity. The regression models developed for soil moisture estimation from frequency has R2 ranging from 0.92 - 0.95, which is significant for accepting the models. The bulk EC measurements were transformed to pore water EC, and a threshold regression model has been developed from for determining soil salinity at different moisture levels. The threshold pore water EC regression model has an R2 of 0.74, which is acceptable for determining salinity from pore water EC values. Â© 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The increase in population and decrease in agricultural land per capita requires intelligent management to increase production per unit area and higher productivity of land use to ensure food security. In this regard, evaluation of soil fertility and productivity is a prerequisite for sustainable agricultural development. The present study sought to investigate the soil fertility status of GIS-based Fuzzy-AHP(FAHP) techniques to assess the soil fertility status of wheat crops in Shadkam plain of Fars province. For this purpose 210 study samples from topsoil were collected and the most important chemical parameters affecting soil fertility were analyzed. According to the results, the most important limiting characteristics were OC, available phosphorus and soil pH. The application of FAHP method determined 4130.01 ha, 10.82\% of land very high fertility class, 7615.30 ha, 19.95\% high fertility class, 23942.30 ha, 62.77\% moderately fertility class, and 2452.10 ha, 6.42\% low fertility class. Thus, the fuzzy-AHP model is found to be of high accuracy for predicting soil fertility in the study area. Overall, it can be concluded that the preparation of a soil fertility map separately can be an effective tool and first step in soil fertility studies and the optimal use of fertilizers.

VL  - 47
SN  - NA
AB  - Conservation management practices with minimum soil mobilization, maintenance of amounts of straw in the soil, and chiseling of ratoons interrows can be beneficial to soil quality, nutrition and sugarcane yield; however, the combination of these practices and their influence over the culture cycle should be better understood. This study aimed to assess the effects of levels of remaining straw and chiseling in the cultivation of ratoons on soil fertility, nutritional status and yield of stalks and sugar in one sugarcane cycle (five ratoons), under no-tillage and conventional tillage systems. The study was performed in Dourados municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in areas with a Oxisol (Latossolo) with very clayey texture. Design in randomized blocks was adopted, with four repetitions, in a subdivided portions scheme. Portions were composed of levels of remaining straw (0, 50 and 100 \%), annually, and collected alternately in odd years (0I) and even years (0P) established after the plant harvest; sub-portions were composed of systems with and without chiseling. In the fourth ratoon, leaf diagnosis was made with quantification of macro-nutrient contents, and during the fifth ratoon soil samples were collected for chemical analyses. By the end of the cycle, accumulated yields of stalks and sugar were determined. In both management systems, keeping 100 \% of straw improved soil fertility and kept higher yield levels in one sugarcane cultivation cycle, while chiseling did not influence soil fertility, nutrition and sugarcane yield. The use of no-tillage farming for sugarcane cultivation proved to be feasible in corrected environments, and did not reduce stalk and sugarcane yield. Straw removal influenced nutrient leaf contents, regardless of soil management. Â© 2023, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.

VL  - 275
SN  - NA
AB  - Imprecise irrigation hinders the sustainable development of the fruit treeâ€“crop intercropping system in the Loess Gully Area of China. Drip fertigation was applied for two years as part of an appleâ€“soybean intercropping system to optimize local water and nutrient management patterns. The effects of different drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on photosynthetic characteristics, soil nutrients, and their interspecific competitions were studied. The treatments were four irrigation levels, namely 60\% (W1), 70\% (W2), 80\% (W3), and 90\% (W4) of field capacity (Fc), and three nitrogen fertilization levels, namely 59 (F1), 92 (F2), and 124 kgâˆ™haâ€“1 (F3). The control (CK) was a rain-fed (neither irrigation nor fertilizer) crop. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and soybean yield (GY) increased at first, but then decreased as irrigation and fertilizer application levels rose. The partial factor productivity (PFP) decreased as fertilization increased, but the soil available nitrogen content showed the opposite trend. The soil nutrients, and soybean Pn and Tr were positively correlated with distance from the apple tree row. The interspecific competition intensity for light and soil water decreased from 2018 to 2019, while root and soil nitrate nitrogen (NN) increased. The interspecific competition correlation between the aboveground and belowground parts was weak and varied between the two intercropping years. A principal component analysis showed that treatment W3F2 had the highest comprehensive score. Thus, a combination of irrigation at 80\% Fc and 92 kgâˆ™haâ€“1 nitrogen fertilizer application is optimal for the system. A multiple regression analysis indicated a water input range of 4624.49â€“4795.75 m3Â·haâˆ’1Â·aâˆ’1 combined with 84.10â€“107.27 kgÂ·haâˆ’1Â·aâˆ’1 fertilizer application was suitable for optimal irrigation and fertilization management based on the integrated benefits to root length density, GY, Pn, and PFP during the first 4â€“5 years of the intercropping system.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0â€“15, 15â€“30, and 30â€“45 cm layers of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems, Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had 203\%, 195\%, and 129\% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than fallow land in the 0â€“15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer, those land-use systems had 199\%, 82\%, and 110\% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those land uses had 232\%, 23\%, and 105\% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS had 198\%, 190\%, and 125\% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land in 0â€“15 cm soil layer. In the 15â€“30 cm soil layer, those land-use systems had 19\%9, 82\%, and 110\% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUSâ€™ adoption in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land. Â© 2023 by the authors.

AB  - ã€Objectiveã€‘It is of great significance to elucidate the effects of different rice-straw returning techniques on soil properties and the underlying mechanisms of rhizosphere microbial remediation and soil improvement, and to find an efficient straw returning technology suitable for the tobacco-rice rotation area in Fujian, so as to lay a basis for high-quality and efficient crop cultivation.ã€Methodã€‘Using flue-cured tobacco Yunyan 87 and late rice Yongyou 1540 as materials, a 2-year field experiment was carried out to reveal changes in soil nutrient properties and microbial communities in tobacco-rice rotation system and their relationships under various straw returning modes.ã€Resultsã€‘With rice straw returning for two consecutive years, grain yield of each treatment was significantly increased, among which, T2 treatment with lime and urea was the best. The yield of tobacco and rice under T2 treatment increased by 25.67\% and 11.49\% respectively compared with T0, followed by T3 treatment with Fuganlin and urea, and T1 treatment with straw returning. In the first year, the yield of tobacco in T1 treatment was not significantly different from that of the control, but in the second year, the yields of tobacco and rice were 3.77\% and 5.90\% higher than those of the control, respectively. After two consecutive years of straw returning, the nutrient and organic carbon contents of topsoil in each treatment were significantly increased, T2 treatment ranked first, followed by T3 treatment. The contents of alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, soil organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in T2 treatment increased by 7.09\%, 5.97\%, 3.01\%, 11.32\% and 5.47\%, respectively compared with the control. The rhizosphere microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundance of HSB\_OF53-F07 related to carbon source metabolism, Arthrobacter related to the degradation of toxic substances and Pseudeurotium related to cellulolysis increased significantly in T2 and T3 treatments compared with the control, while the abundance of Humicola and Penicillium associated with pathogenesis decreased significantly. Further correlation analysis found that the increase of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere were positively correlated with soil nutrients, while the abundance of pathogenic bacteria were negatively correlated with soil nutrients.ã€Conclusionã€‘Rice-straw returning with lime or Fuganlin and appropriate amount of urea is conducive to increasing the nutrient contents in the topsoil, promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, inhibiting pathogenic bacteria, and creating a good soil environment for tobacco-rice rotation, and thus improving crop yield.

AB  - Agriculture acquires a substantial role in the economic development and employment of every nation. Ever increasing population of the world and the depletion of agriculture provide great concern among the expert community to enhance crop production by implementing advanced techniques such as precise agriculture. Soil fertility estimation and crop recommendation are key concepts involved in increasing food production as the yield of the crops directly depends on the soil fertility and the best quality crop. Hence, in this research, a survey on the existing prediction models is performed to reveal the significance of crop yield prediction, which is the aim of this research article. The advantages and drawbacks of the existing techniques are analyzed to provide an effective organic farming experience. Â© 2023 IEEE.

VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - A field trial was conducted during rainy, winter and late winter seasons of 2015â€“16 and 2016â€“17 at the research farm of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dhar, Madhya Pradesh to study the influence of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] based cropping systems on nutrient uptake and soil fertility balance in Vertisols of Central India. In this study, 16 cropping sequences was sequenced with soybean and feasible winter viz. wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), garlic (Allium sativum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) with inclusion of garlic (Allium sativum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.) in late winter and tested in randomized block design with four replications. Soybean yield equivalent (SEY) of cropping system as a whole were recorded significantly maximum in T15â€”soybean (JS 93-05)â€“potato (Kufri jyoti)â€“onion (AFLR) cropping sequence (17.7 t/ha) and nitrogen use efficiency (126) as compared to existing cropping sequences (soybeanâ€“wheat and soybeanâ€“chick pea). The minimum productivity of the cropping sequence based on SEYs was registered in soybean (JS 95-60)â€“chickpea (JG-130) desi i.e. 4.28 t/ha however, nitrogen use efficiency (35.0) was recorded minimum in T1â€”soybean (JS 95-60)â€“wheat (HI-1544) aestivum. The uptake of nitrogen (457 kg/ha) was observed higher under T16â€”soybean (JS 93-05)â€“garden pea (Arkel)â€“garlic (G-282) while highest phosphorus (65.8 kg/ha) and potassium (562 kg/ha) uptake was recorded in T15â€”soybean (JS 93-05)â€“potato (Kufri jyoti)â€“onion (AFLR) system.

TI  - Improved yields and essential oil composition of ajowan ({Trachyspermum} ammi {L}.) and soil fertility properties in intercropping systems
VL  - 39
SN  - NA
AB  - Legume-based intercropping systems have been proposed as sustainable and eco-friendly systems with potential to improve crop production and soil fertility. A field experiment was conducted in two growing seasons (2017 and 2018) to determine optimal intercropping patterns of ajowan (Trachyspermum ammi L.) and fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) to increase yield and quality of the ajowan and to improve soil properties. The treatments evaluated in this study were sole cropping of ajowan (A) and fenugreek (F), replacement intercropping series of A:F (1:1, 4:4, 3:1, and 1:3 ratios) and additive intercropping series of A:F (100:12.5, 100:25, 100:37.5, 100:50, 100:62.5, 100:75, and 100:87.5 ratios). The results showed that the highest biological yield (4172.7 kg haâˆ’1), seed yield (1009.7 kg haâˆ’1), and essential oil yield (42.0 kg haâˆ’1) of ajowan were obtained in the additive pattern A:F 100:25. The highest concentrations of thymol and Î³-terpinene, the major chemical components of ajowan essential oil, were recorded for the A:F 100:25 intercropping pattern. Total LER and ATER indices were above one in all of the intercropping patterns. The concentrations of soil total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TON), available forms of NO3âˆ’ and NH4+, Mg2+, K+, as well as basal respiration (BR) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) in the A:F 100:25 intercropping pattern were greater than for the fenugreek and ajowan sole crops. Overall, the analysis showed that the A:F 100:25 additive intercropping pattern had positive and strong effects in terms of increased yield and quality of ajowan and improvement of soil fertility.

TI  - Determination of soil bulk density dynamic in a {Vertisol} during wetting and drying cycles using combined soil water content and thermal property sensors
VL  - 428
SN  - NA
AB  - The dynamics of soil bulk density (BD) play an important role in soil water, heat, and gas transport, which is more complicated in Vertisols due to the shrinking and swelling process. Previous studies showed BD can be estimated from soil thermal conductivity (Î») and water content (Î¸v) measurements. Thus we comprehensively evaluated the applicability of the commercial sensors (5TE/TP01) in determining soil BD dynamic affected by wetting and drying cycles in a Vertisol. The repacked and intact soil cores with various BD and Î¸v values were used to evaluate the accuracy of the two sensors for determining BD. We also assessed the potential of two thermal greases (MX-4 and TFX) in improving probe-soil contact and in determining BD dynamic of the Vertisol during wetting and drying (WD) cycle by different BD estimation models (Tian-de Vries model and Lu model). Results showed that the 5TE/TP01 combination gave accurate BD estimates with RMSEs of 0.0179â€“0.120 Mg mâˆ’3. For the WD cycle experiment, soil shrinkage led to a large bias in BD estimation. Thermal grease enhancing contact between the probes and soil matrix improved the accuracy of BD estimates, in which the TFX grease performed better (RMSE: 0.031â€“0.082 Mg mâˆ’3) than the MX-4 grease (RMSE: 0.067â€“0.204 Mg mâˆ’3). In regard to BD estimation models, the Lu model gave more accurate BD estimates (RMSE: 0.031â€“0.082 Mg mâˆ’3) than the Tian-de Vries model (RMSE: 0.057â€“0.187 Mg mâˆ’3). The high bias of BD estimation during WD cycles mainly occurred at the dry end side of soil shrinkage and at the beginning of wetting, which may result from soil cracking and the hysteresis of soil swelling. Our results demonstrate that the commercially available sensors in measuring soil water content and thermal property (e.g., 5TE/TP01) with the aid of thermal grease is a promising method to estimate the BD dynamics in Vertisols.

VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients assessment has great importance in horticulture. Implementation of an information system for horticulture faces many challenges: (i) great spatial variability within farms (e.g., hilly topography); (ii) different soil properties (e.g., different water holding capacity, different content in sand, sit, clay, and soil organic matter, different pH, and different permeability) for different cultivated plants; (iii) different soil nutrient uptake by different cultivated plants; (iv) small size of monoculture; and (v) great variety of farm components, agroecological zone, and socio-economic factors. Advances in information and communication technologies enable creation of low cost, efficient information systems that would improve resources management and increase productivity and sustainability of horticultural farms. We present an information system based on different sensing capability, Internet of Things, and mobile application for horticultural farms. An overview on different techniques and technologies for soil fertility evaluation is also presented. The results obtained in a botanical garden that simulates the diversity of environment and plant diversity of a horticultural farm are discussed considering the challenges identified in the literature and field research. The study provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the development of technologies that enable horticultural farmers to improve resources management. Â© 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of six types of FS methods from four categories (filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid) were compared. These FS algorithms chose relevant covariates from a set of 1049 environmental covariates for predicting five soil fertility properties in ten fields, in combination with ten different ML algorithms. The resulting model performance was compared by three different metrics (R2 of 10-fold cross validation (CV), robustness ratio (RR; developed in this study), and independent validation with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (IV-CCC)). Wrapper (BorutaShap) and embedded (Lasso-FS, Random forest-FS) methods with decision-tree based ML algorithms usually led to the optimal models. Â© 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Soil nutrients are a comprehensive reflection of soil characteristics, and this paper proposes a recurrent neural network method with a fusion mechanism to construct a soil nutrient evaluation model in this area. Soil nutrient indicators are used as the input of the neural network, and soil nutrient levels are used as the output. The results obtained by the recurrent neural network are better through experimental simulation training and prediction, and the experimental comparison with related neural network models shows that the grade results obtained by the recurrent neural network are more accurate, and the establishment and prediction of this model provides a new way for soil nutrient fertility grade evaluation, and the MSE 0.031 of the fused recurrent neural network proposed in this paper is smaller than the mean square error value of the traditional model. The decision coefficient R2 of 0.978 is closer to 1 compared with other models, indicating that the initial weights and thresholds of the recurrent neural network optimized using the algorithm of this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and fitting performance of the model.

A good soil quality is important for successful agricultural outcomes because it ensures that plants and crops are maintained. Through correct management of soil nutrients, crop yield will increase. The authors propose the design and development of an automated control system for soil nutrient deficiency of yellow corn. The device will be composed of sensors, controller, power source, and fertilizer applicator to be installed in an agricultural field and apply the appropriate treatment process. The sensor detects the amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in the soil. The system is intended to determine what nutrients are deficient. After the detection process, a signal is transmitted to the fertilizer applicator to start the treatment process. Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Beneficial shift of rhizosphere soil nutrients and metabolites under a sugarcane/peanut intercropping system
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Intercropping systems have been studied as a sustainable agricultural planting pattern to increase soil quality and crop yields. However, the relationships between metabolites and soil physicochemical properties remain poorly understood under sugarcane/peanut intercropping system. Thus, we determined the rhizosphere soil physicochemical properties, and analyzed rhizosphere soil metabolites and root metabolites by metabolomics method under monoculture and intercropping patterns of sugarcane and peanut. The results showed that pH, the contents of total phosphorus (P), total potassium (K), available nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), and available potassium (K) were higher in rhizosphere soil of intercropping peanut than monoculture peanut, and the content of total P was higher in rhizosphere soil of intercropping sugarcane than monoculture sugarcane. Sugarcane/peanut intercropping also significantly increased the activities of acid phosphatase and urease in rhizosphere soil. The metabolomics results showed that 32 metabolites, mainly organic acids and their derivatives (25.00\%), nucleotides and their metabolites (18.75\%), were detected in root and rhizosphere soil samples. In the MP-S (rhizosphere soil of monoculture peanut) vs. IP-S (rhizosphere soil of intercropping peanut) comparison, 47 differential metabolites (42 upregulated) were screened, including glycerolipids (19.15\%), organic acids and their derivatives (17.89\%), and amino acids and their metabolites (12.77\%). In the MS-S (rhizosphere soil of monoculture sugarcane) vs. IS-S (rhizosphere soil of intercropping sugarcane) comparison, 51 differential metabolites (26 upregulated) were screened, including heterocyclic compounds (15.69\%), glycerolipids (11.76\%), and organic acids and their derivatives (9.80\%). The metabolite species from MP-S, MS-S, IP-S, and IS-S were similar, but some metabolite contents were significantly different, such as adenine, adenosine, maltotriose, thermozeaxanthin-13 and PE-NMe (20:0/24:0). Adenine and adenosine were detected in root and rhizosphere soils, and their levels were increased in the intercropping treatment, which were mainly related to enhanced purine metabolism in root and rhizosphere soils under the sugarcane/peanut intercropping system. Importantly, adenine and adenosine were significantly positively correlated with total P and total K contents, acid phosphatase and urease activities, and pH. This study clarified that the sugarcane/peanut intercropping system could improve soil nutrients and enzymes and was related to purine metabolism.

TI  - Soil fertility in slash and burn agricultural systems in central {Mozambique
VL  - 322
SN  - NA
AB  - Slash and burn is a land use practice widespread all over the world, and nowadays it is formally recognized as the principal livelihood system in rural areas of South America, Asia, and Africa. The practice consists of a land rotation where users cut native or secondary forest to establish a new crop field and, in some cases, build charcoal kilns with the cut wood to produce charcoal. Due to several socio-economic changes in developing countries, some scientists and international organizations have questioned the sustainability of slash and burn since in some cases, crop yield does not justify the soil degradation caused. To estimate the soil quality in agricultural and forest soils at different ages of the forest-fallow period (25, 35, and 50 years), this survey investigated rural areas in three locations in Manica province, central Mozambique: Vanduzi, Sussundenga, and Macate. Soil profiles were trenched and sampled with a pedological approach under crop fields and forest-fallow. The chronosequence was selected to test the hypothesis that the increase in forest-fallow age causes an improvement of soil fertility. Results highlighted discrete variations among locations in mineralogy, Al- and Fe-oxyhydroxides, sand, silt, pH, total organic carbon, humic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, chloride, nitrate, fluoride, and ammonium. Few differences in mineralogy, Fe-oxyhydroxides, available P, chloride, and nitrate were detected between crop fields and forest-fallow within the same location. Such differences were mostly ascribed to intrinsic fertility inherited from the parent material rather than a longer forest-fallow period. However, physicochemical soil property improvement did not occur under a forest age of 50 years (the longest forest-fallow considered), indicating that harmonization of intrinsic fertility and agronomic practices may increase soil organic matter and nutrient contents more than a long forest-fallow period.

TI  - Improving the {Extraction} {Process} of {Mehlich} 3 {Method} for {Calcareous} {Soil} {Nutrients
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient testing is an effective way to uncover soil nutrient status. However, the conventional testing method (CT method) and Mehlich 3 method (M3 method) demand long-time consumption, tedious testing steps, high testing cost, dangerous chemicals contained in extractant, etc. Therefore, it is important to develop a new rapid test method or improve the existing rapid test method of soil available nutrients. In this study, an improved Mehlich3 method (IM3 method) with the new combined extractant were developed and evaluated on the testing feasibility, precision, efficiency, and cost. The results showed that: (1) IM3 method avoided the usage of two hazardous chemicals, i.e., ammonium nitrate and nitric acid, which were difficult in purchase and storage but contained in the combined extractant of M3 method. (2) The correlation coefficients of available P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in calcareous soil between M3 and CT, and between IM3 and CT methods all reached highly significant level. The correlation coefficient of available Zn between IM3 and CT method was significantly higher than that between M3 and CT method, and those of the other elements had not obviously changed. (3) The variation coefficients of available P, K, Fe and Cu determined by M3 and IM3 methods were all lower than those determined by CT method. The variation coefficients of available Mn and Zn determined by IM3 were 3.67\% and 6.43\%, which were slightly higher than those determined by CT method with 2.72\% and 5.29\%, but were lower than those determined by M3 method. (4) Under the premise of ensuring testing precision, IM3 method took only 6.3 min/piece for determining six elements, reducing testing time by 70.7\% and 3.08\% compared with CT (21.5 min/piece) and M3 (6.5 min/piece) methods, respectively. The testing cost of IM3 method was reduced by 26\% and 61.2\% compared with M3 and CT methods, respectively. In conclusion, IM3 method is an ideal rapid measurement method for the simultaneous determination of available soil nutrients in calcareous soil. Â© 2022 by the authors.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In this article, a method for the simultaneous measurement of total biomass, vegetation water content, and soil moisture is developed based on ultra-wideband (UWB) nadir observation of the reflection coefficient in the frequency range from 450 MHz to 6 GHz. The proposed method is based on a simple model of plane wave reflection from a vegetation layer with flat boundaries lying on a smooth soil surface. The model does not take into account the phenomena of wave scattering on the vegetation elements and the soil surface roughness. The dielectric constant of the vegetation canopy and soil were calculated based on Ulaby and Mironov dielectric models, respectively. The proposed method was tested using data from PORTOS-93 (INRA) experiments on measuring: total biomass (up to 3.3 kg/m2), water content (43\%-89\%), height (up to 1m) and volumetric content (up to 0.6-0.8\%) of wheat plants, moisture (from 5\% to 36\%), density and clay fraction content (27\%) of the soil. As a result, it was shown, the coefficient of determination ({\textbackslash}mathrmR{\textasciicircum}2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) appeared to be equal to {\textbackslash}mathrmR{\textasciicircum}2=0.999 and RMSE=2.2\% when comparing the original and retrieved values of volumetric soil moisture. The retrieved values of total biomass (vegetation water content) with the coefficient of determination {\textbackslash}mathrmR{\textasciicircum}2=0.999 (0.998) and RMSE=16g/m2 (0.7\%) coincide with the original set values. Therewith, the bands from 4 GHz to 6 GHz and from 450 MHz to 1 GHz were used to retrieve the canopy biometric parameters and soil moisture, respectively. Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - The effect of land management and organic matter inputs on bacterial population and soil nutrients across different types of agroforestry system
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Different management of agroforestry systems changes crop composition and growth. This will affect organic matter inputs that become the source of food and energy for soil microorganisms. The soil organisms themself play an important role in amplifying soil biogeochemical processes and regulating soil reactions. This process allows the nutrients to be released into the soil and absorbed by the crop. This study aimed to examine the abundance of soil bacterial population and the changes in soil chemical properties (soil pH, total soil organic carbon (C), and total soil N (Nitrogen) under different land management and organic matter inputs. The determination of total organic C and total soil N was used by Walkey and Black and Kjedahl methods. Total Plate Count (TPC) techniques were employed to measure Total Bacteria Population (TBP) and Total Cellulolytic Bacteria (TCB). The Randomized Complete Block Design was used along with the 5\% Tukey's test to examine the significant effect of the treatments. These treatments consisted of various agroforestry system as follow: (i) pine-coffee agroforestry system (PK), (ii) pine-banana agroforestry system (PPs), (iii) pine-cardamom agroforestry system (PR), (iv) pine-vegetable agroforestry system (PS), (v) mixed garden (KC), and (vi) citrus (LJ). Each treatment was repeated four times to obtain 24 experimental plots using a size of 20 m x 20 m. The results showed that the highest organic C and N content was obtained at the PK (agroforestry of pine at 41 years and coffee at 11 years old) plot, which was about 6.64\% and 0.56\%. Those parameters strongly correspond to the greatest soil bacteria population and soil cellulolytic bacteria population at the value of 1,71 x 105 CFU/g and 4,24 x 104 CFU/g, resulting from the greatest quantity of in-situ litter accumulation at PK plot to reach about 201.35 g. The dry weight value of litter in situ at the PK plot is greater than that of the PS and LJ plots by 81\% and 87\%. A power equation followed the relationship between soil organic C and the total bacteria population. A similar trend has been observed between total soil Nitrogen and total bacteria population. We concluded that changes in different management could affect soil chemical conditions and the changes in the total population of soil bacteria and cellulolytic soil bacteria.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has a huge influence on farmers in the agricultural industry. Farmers in the agricultural business have the fundamental difficulty of monitoring factors such as wind, humidity, water, temperature, and soil fertility. We proposed this approach as a solution to such problems. For our project, we will use a soil moisture sensor to compute the amount of water held in the soil horizon. It does not detect soil moisture directly. Instead, they monitor changes in another soil property that is known to be related to water content. The data from these sensors is regularly transmitted to the cloud using the ESP8266. The purpose of smart agriculture is to increase agricultural output and make farm management easier for farmers.

TI  - Combining thermal imaging and soil water content sensors to assess tree water status in pear trees
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Volumetric soil water content is commonly used for irrigation management in fruit trees. By integrating direct information on tree water status into measurements of soil water content, we can improve detection of water stress and irrigation scheduling. Thermal-based indicators can be an alternative to traditional measurements of midday stem water potential and stomatal conductance for irrigation management of pear trees (Pyrus communis L.). These indicators are easy, quick, and cost-effective. The soil and tree water status of two cultivars of pear trees â€˜Dâ€™Anjouâ€™ and â€˜Bartlettâ€™ submitted to regulated deficit irrigation was measured regularly in a pear orchard in Rock Island, WA (USA) for two seasons, 2021 and 2022. These assessments were compared to the canopy temperature (Tc), the difference between the canopy and air temperature (Tc-Ta) and the crop water stress index (CWSI). Trees under deficit irrigation had lower midday stem water potential and stomatal conductance but higher Tc, Tc-Ta, and CWSI. Tc was not a robust method to assess tree water status since it was strongly related to air temperature (R = 0.99). However, Tc-Ta and CWSI were greater than 0Â°C or 0.5, respectively, and were less dependent on the environmental conditions when trees were under water deficits (midday stem water potential values{\textless} -1.2 MPa). Moreover, values of Tc-Ta = 2Â°C and CWSI = 0.8 occurred when midday stem water potential was close to -1.5 MPa and stomatal conductance was lower than 200 mmol m-2s-1. Soil water content (SWC) was the first indicator in detecting the deficit irrigation applied, however, it was not as strongly related to the tree water status as the thermal-based indicators. Thus, the relation between the indicators studied with the stem water potential followed the order: CWSI {\textgreater} Tc-Ta {\textgreater} SWC = Tc. A multiple regression analysis is proposed that combines both soil water content and thermal-based indices to overcome limitations of individual use of each indicator.

TI  - No-tillage with straw mulching promotes the utilization of soil nitrogen by rice under wheatâ€“rice and oilseed rapeâ€“rice cropping systems
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Introduction: To investigate the effects of no-tillage with straw mulching on the absorption and utilization of soil nitrogen (N), fertilizer N, and straw N by rice under paddy-upland rotations. Methods: A field experiment with three cropping systems: fallowâ€“rice rotation without straw mulching (FRN), wheatâ€“rice rotation with wheat mulching in rice season (WRS), and oilseed rapeâ€“rice rotation with oilseed rape straw mulching in rice season (ORS) was conducted from 2015 to 2017, along with a mini-plot experiment with 15N-labeled urea and straws, which was conducted in 2017. Results: No-tillage with straw reduced rice N uptake up to 20 days after transplanting, the total amount of fertilizer N uptake of WRS and ORS rice plants was 46.33 and 61.67 kg/ha, respectively, which was 9.02 and 45.10\% higher than that of FRN plants. Soil N was the main source for rice growth, followed by fertilizer N. Soil N uptake by WRS and ORS rice plants was 21.75 and 26.82\% higher than that of FRN plants, accounting for 72.37 and 65.47\%, respectively, of the total N accumulated in rice plants. Straw mulching increased the N utilization efficiency of tillering, panicle, and total fertilizer by 2.84â€“25.30\%; however, base fertilizer was dependent on straw mulching. The total amount of N released from WRS and ORS straw mulching in the rice season was 34.97 and 24.82 kg/ha, respectively; however, only 3.04 and 4.82\% of it was absorbed by the rice plants, accounting for only 0.62 and 0.66\% of the total accumulated N. Discussion: No-tillage with straw mulching under paddy-upland rotations increased the N utilization of rice, especially for the absorption of soil N. These results provide theoretical information for the effective utilization of straw and rational N application practices in rice-based cropping systems.

AB  - Soil is the material base of soil fertility. It can not only fix the root system but also provide nutrients, water, and other necessary conditions for crops to promote growth of crops. As a characteristic agricultural product in the Yanbian area, the production of 'Pingguoli' is related to the development of the agricultural economy in the Yanbian area. To solve the agricultural problems caused by excessive fertilisation in 'Pingguoli' orchards in the Yanbian area and to study the correlation between rare elements and soil properties. Based on the collection of regional natural economic background and soil data in the study area, four treatments were set up: The soil and 'Pingguoli' samples were collected, and the total amount of rare earth elements in the soil samples and the related indexes of 'Pingguoli' fruit were detected. Soil is the material basis of soil fertility, and soil management determines crop growth. CF1 treatment could increase 'Pingguoli' yield and significantly improve fruit quality. The rate of fruit softening and bad fruit decreased significantly after storage. Reduction of fertilisation can improve quality and save cost, among which CF1 has the best effect and can obtain more benefits when applied in production. Implications: Through experiments, agricultural workers can be more deeply aware of the importance of soil to crops; reducing fertilisation can lead to better crop yield and quality while achieving greater benefits, and consumers can get healthier food.

AB  - A study was undertaken in a long-term experiment on effect of organic manures and nutrient management on soil fertility and soil organic carbon (SOC) after 16 years cycles of pearl milletâ€“wheat cropping system in a coarse loamy, Typic Haplusterts of subtropical India. Significant build-up of soil fertility in terms of alkaline KMnO4-N, Olsen-P, NH4 OAc-K as well as SOC namely, total organic carbon (TOC), Walkley and Black organic carbon (WBC), labile organic carbon (LBC) and periodical changes of SOC during cropping season were maintained under different organic manures (FYM, poultry manure and pressmud) alone or integrated nutrient management over control plot in different depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm) of the soils. The highest values of TOC (13.2 g kg-1), WBC (11.2 g kg-1) and LBC (1.22 g kg-1) were maintained in 15 t FYM + 150 kg N ha-1 + 30 kg P2 O5 ha-1 treated plot. The magnitude of change in WBC in sub-surface (15â€“30 and 30-45 cm) soil was low compared to surface soil (0-15 cm). Highly strong relationships were exhibited between LBC with yield, indicating that these pools are more important for nutrient turn-over and their availability to plants than total SOC. Carbon management index revealed that integrated nutrient management could be followed for enhancement of crop productivity, nutrient availability and soil carbon pools for long-term. These results conclude that for sustainable crop production and maintaining soil quality, input of organic manure like FYM is of major importance and should be advocated in the nutrient management of intensive cropping system for improving soil fertility and biological properties of soils.

AB  - In the course of the broad expansion of organic farming, a considerable increase in the number of different cultivation types has also occurred. Compared to the formerly ideal forms with arable farming and animal husbandry around 0.5â€“1.0 LU haâˆ’1 and the corresponding use of organic manure, an increasing differentiation of cultivation systems can be observed today. There are market crop systems without livestock and purchased fertilizer with less than 20\% legumes and forage cropping systems with more than 2.5 LU haâˆ’1 livestock and a cultivation of grain and forage legumes of more than 50\% in the crop rotations. From a long list of corresponding survey studies of farms in agricultural practice as well as a number of important long-term field trials, in this overview paper it was possible to investigate and to discuss both the manifold possibilities and the limitations of intensification in organic agriculture by a comparative analysis of results from a wide range of cropping systems from Central Europe. The short-term as well as the long-term effects on the development of yield and quality performance of crop rotations, nutrient management, and soil fertility, as well as of important environmental effects, were quantified, and aspects of further development and sustainability of organic farming systems were shown in detail.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients are a vital part of soil fertility and other environmental factors. Soil testing is an efficient tool used to evaluate the existing nutrient levels of soil and aid to compute the appropriate quantity of soil nutrients depending upon the fertility level and crop requirements. Since the conventional soil nutrient testing models are not feasible in real time applications, an efficient soil nutrient, and potential of hydrogen (pH) prediction models are essential to improve overall crop productivity. In this aspect, this paper aims to design an intelligent soil nutrient and pH classification using weighted voting ensemble deep learning (ISNpHC-WVE) technique. The proposed ISNpHC-WVE technique aims to classify the existence of nutrients and pH levels exist in the soil. In addition, three deep learning (DL) models namely gated recurrent unit (GRU), deep belief network (DBN), and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) were used for the predictive analysis. Moreover, a weighted voting ensemble model was employed which allows a weight vector on every DL model of the ensemble depending upon the attained accuracy on every class. Furthermore, the hyperparameter optimization of the three DL models was performed using manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm. For investigating the enhanced predictive performance of the ISNpHC-WVE technique, a comprehensive simulation analysis takes place to examine the pH and soil nutrient classification performance. The experimental results showcased the better performance of the ISNpHC-WVE technique over the recent techniques with accuracy of 0.9281 and 0.9497 on soil nutrient and soil pH classification. The proposed model can be utilized as an effective tool to improve productivity in agriculture by proper soil nutrient and pH classification. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Soil moisture sensing with {mmWave} radar
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a significant factor that influences plant productivity and natural resource management. Accurate commercial soil moisture sensors often require manual data collection and cost thousands of dollars, which makes data collection inefficient and only accessible to high-budget smart farms. To achieve cost-effective and high-efficient soil moisture sensing, we propose a millimeterwave (mmWave) radar-based method, which can obtain the soil moisture from the propagation time and Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the reflected signals received at multiple antennas. Our method only requires a single Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mmWave radar to automatically estimate the soil moisture level. Our experiment in outdoor environments shows that the proposed system produces a mean absolute error of 2.2\% volumetric water content (VWC), demonstrating the feasibility of the low-cost non-contact soil moisture sensing for smart farming.

TI  - Accuracy calibration and evaluation of capacitance-based soil moisture sensors for a variety of soil properties
VL  - 273
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate measurement of soil moisture (Î¸) is key to hydrology and agriculture research. Soil moisture sensor technology is the predominant method for measuring Î¸, and such measurements are used as a standard for evaluating results from remote sensing and data assimilation. Therefore, improving the Î¸ measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors is of great significance. This study used the capacitance-based soil moisture sensor (5TM, Decagon Devices, Inc.) as an example to illustrate the necessity of calibration. The 5TM soil moisture sensor calculates Î¸ by measuring the dielectric constant (Îµ) of the soil medium, and Îµ is affected by soil properties (texture, salinity, soil organic matter, etc.). Consequently, a common calibration model (CCM) was developed to calibrate Î¸ from the 5TM sensor by incorporating the soil properties using soil samples collected from 17 sites in 13 provinces in China at 4 different depths. First, the Î¸ change experiments were conducted in the laboratory for each soil sample. Second, a linear calibration model (LCM) was applied to calibrate the 5TM measured soil moisture (Î¸5TM) based on â€œtrueâ€ soil moisture (Î¸true) assessed through the gravimetric method. The results indicated (1) high correlation coefficient (R=0.95) was found for Î¸5TM and Î¸true, but with a high root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.051 m3mâˆ’3, and a more significant underestimation with increasing Î¸; (2) LCM calibration results (Î¸LCM) showed a higher R (0.99) and a lower RMSE (0.017 m3mâˆ’3). Finally, the CCM was established through relating the LCM coefficients (aLCMandbLCM) and soil properties based on multiple regression, with RMSE of 0.126 m3mâˆ’3 and 0.023 m3mâˆ’3 for aCCMandbCCM respectively. The CCM calibrated result (Î¸CCM) showed an RMSE of 0.02 m3mâˆ’3 and R of 0.98. CCM can almost replace LCM in terms of similar accuracy. In this study, a CCM for soil moisture sensors is proposed, which provides a new approach for soil moisture sensor calibration. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Prediction of soil water contents and erodibility indices based on artificial neural networks: using topography and remote sensing
VL  - 194
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aimed to predict some soil water contents and soil erodibility indices with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) using remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI TIRS) and topographic variables from a digital elevation model (DEM) in a semi-arid ecosystem. In models, the input variables were derived from remote sensing imaging and DEM. The output variables were field capacity, wilting point, aggregate stability index, structural stability index, dispersion ratio, and clay flocculation index. This study was realized in the watersheds of the Koruluk dam, the KÄ±zlarkalesi, and the Telme ponds built for agricultural irrigation in GÃ¼mÃ¼ÅŸhane-Åžiran. The soil samples were obtained from two depths (0â€“10 cm and 10â€“20 cm) from 59 soil profiles. Besides field capacity, wilting point, and aggregate stability analysis, undispersed/dispersed sand, silt, clay contents, and organic matter analysis were performed due to their strong effect on soil moisture, soil water content, and erodibility indices. The correlation analysis results showed significant relationships between soil characteristics and soil water contents/soil erodibility indices. The remote sensing variables were derived from three Landsat images of 2015 (June, July, and September). The performance results of MLP ANN models predicted for soil water contents and erodibility indices ranged from 0.75 to 0.90 for R2, 0.046â€“4.115 for root mean square error (RMSE), 4.46â€“6.54 for normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and 0.042â€“0.186 for mean absolute error (MAE). Topography was a more significant group of variables that affected soil water contents and soil erodibility indices and the feature importance of topography in the prediction was over 55\%. The results showed that the use of topographic variables together with remote sensing variables in MLP ANN modeling increased the performance of the models.

AB  - Water is a valuable resource and an understanding of soil moisture dynamics is critical in many land management, agricultural and engineering applications. Satellite and UAV remote sensing platforms present an opportunity for rapid, cost-efficient data collection; however, soil moisture remote sensing presents unique challenges. Specifically, spectral bands near 1400nm and 1900nm associated with water are typically avoided in remote sensing data products due to strong interference by atmospheric moisture. Using soil reflectance data collected in the lab, this paper presents a number of linear equations which maybe be applied to predict soil moisture content from Landsat 5 MSS, 7 TM and 9 data, as well as other NIR sensors collecting data at 1720, 1782, 2140 and 2240nm.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - With the growing availability of environmental covariates, feature selection (FS) is becoming an essential task for applying machine learning (ML) in digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, the effectiveness of six types of FS methods from four categories (filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid) were compared. These FS algorithms chose relevant covariates from an exhaustive set of 1049 environmental covariates for predicting five soil fertility properties in ten fields, in combination with ten different ML algorithms. Resulting model performance was compared by three different metrics (R2 of 10-fold cross validation (CV), robustness ratio (RR; developed in this study), and independent validation with Linâ€™s concordance correlation coefficient (IV-CCC)). FS improved CV, RR, and IV-CCC compared to the models built without FS for most fields and soil properties. Wrapper (BorutaShap) and embedded (Lasso-FS, Random forest-FS) methods usually led to the optimal models. The filter-based ANOVA-FS method mostly led to overfit models, especially for fields with smaller sample quantities. Decision-tree based models were usually part of the optimal combination of FS and ML. Considering RR helped identify optimal combinations of FS and ML that can improve the performance of DSM compared to models produced from full covariate stacks. Â© 2022 by the authors.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Printing electronics allows us to fabricate low-cost, simple sensor networks. Distributed soil moisture sensors in agriculture industry will result in better water management practices; however, price and reliability do not allow for ubiquitous availability. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of low-cost, flexible, interdigitated electrode (IDE) soil moisture sensors with the electrode widths of 537, 877, 1055, 1204, and 1916 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm on polyimide (PI) substrates using a silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) ink. The sensors were tested in sandy textured soil with a volumetric water content ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 m3/m3. Analytically, the sensitivities of all the sensors are expected to be equal, as the proposed mechanisms dictate that the capacitance should depend linearly on the dielectric constant of the moist soil. However, we found the sensitivity for the widest IDE, which measured 1916 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm to be 442 pF/H2O volumetric percentage, whereas the sensitivity for the sensor with 537- {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm -wide electrodes to be only 221 pF/H2O volumetric percentage. We hypothesized that the increase in sensitivity can be directly related to the increase in the capacitive fringing field height, which results in increased sensing volume for the widest IDE. The increased sensing volume leads to increased water molecule polarization, increasing the overall capacitance change with respect to changing water content. To validate the hypothesis, we conducted electric fringing field experiments to observe the trend between the maximum fringing field height and the electrode width of an IDE. Results confirmed that increased sensing volume was caused by the increased fringing field height of the electrode in an IDE. Â© 2001-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Distinct community assembly and co-existence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and diazotrophs across large-scale soil fertility to improve functions in alfalfa cultivation systems
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Unravelling the community assembly processes of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and diazotrophs as well as their co-existence under different soil fertility environments are vital to develop a better understanding of agroecosystem functions, which is a crucial yet poorly understood topic. We examined the soils from 99 typical alfalfa cultivation systems to formulate a comprehensive picture of AMF and diazotrophic community and presented the first simultaneous investigation of the assembly processes and their co-existence. The distributions of both AMF and diazotrophic communities were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) corresponded to soil integrated fertility index (IFI). We quantified the relative contributions of five ecological processes in AMF and diazotrophic community assembly under different soil fertility environments, with stochastic assembly primarily determined across all soil fertility groups. The coexistence networks of AMF and diazotrophs were also notably different among typical soil fertility systems, where the most complex interactions were observed in high fertility system while medium fertility system was found to be the simplest. The active hubs detected in different fertility system were sensitively responded to different soil variables. We offered new opportunities to improve agroecosystem functions, especially for legumes, by regulating the potential key species or indirectly manipulating their drivers.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Dryland pastures are usually on soils with a low fertility. However, a high spatial variability is apparent in pasture soils. In consequence, the application of inputs should be based on the particular characteristics of each field and their within-field variability. In this study, a comparative analysis of seven experimental fields (agroâ€“silvoâ€“pastoral ecosystems) in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula was performed using a probabilistic and objective model. Some soil properties (the texture, cation exchange capacity, soil apparent electrical conductivity, organic matter, nitrogen, potassium and slope) measured at six sampling locations in each field were consolidated in the model. It was verified that the data fit the model and, later, a ranking of all the sampling locations and, consequently, a ranking of all the experimental fields according to the pasture soil fertility was established. Moreover, another output of the model was a ranking of the soil properties according to their influence on the soil fertility: the topographical property, the slope, was the most influential as it is related to the level of other important soil properties, as the textural components. Two fields, Cubillos and Grous, had the highest overall soil fertility levels because the soil samples in these fields were very fertile. However, some samples in the other five fields were also in the group of the most fertile, denoting the existence of an important spatial variability within each field. The proposed method is a rational way to improve the efficiency of the use of fertilisers by adjusting them to the soil pasture fertility. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility using the soil fertility index method on several land uses in {Tutur} {District}, {Pasuruan} {Regency} of {East} {Java
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Changes in land use have an impact on the level of soil fertility. Soil management, such as land cover systems and the environment, are supporting factors. Assessment of soil fertility index using indicators of soil chemical properties such as organic C, availability of nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and exchangeable cations (K, Ca, Mg, Na). The research was conducted in Tutur District, Pasuruan Regency, with a survey of 5 land uses, i.e., mixed crops, coffee plantations, apple plantations, vegetable fields, secondary forests, and conservation forests. Observations were made on elevation, slope, and vegetation. Parameters of physical properties measured were soil texture and aggregate stability. Observations of chemical properties included organic C, N, P, CEC, exchangeable cation (K, Ca, Mg, Na), and soil pH. Soil Fertility Index (SFI) data were analyzed using the Least Significant Difference method at a 5\% level. The results showed the diversity of soil fertility levels obtained from the calculation of the soil fertility index. The soil fertility index value in 5 land uses in Tutur District ranged from 0.67 to 1.00. Coffee plantations had the highest SFI score of 1.00; this condition was supported by an organic C indicator of 6.21\% and a CEC value of 39.12 cmol kg-1. Conservation forest is the land use with the lowest SFI value of 0.67. The value of CEC and cation exchange in conservation forests are factors that impact the low value of SFI. Â© 2022 The authors.

VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - This study estimated seasonal variations among several parameters of the fine roots and N dynamics in Mangifera indica-based agroforestry systems; we examined homegarden (HG), agri-horticulture (AH) and agri-horti-silviculture (AHS) systems in the Bhabhar area of the Indian Central Himalayan region. Fine roots biomass (FRB) and fine roots production (FRP) of M. indica were highest in the AH system and lowest in the HG system while fine roots turnover (FRT) showed a reverse trend. FRB, FRP and FRT rates decreased with soil depth and distance from the tree base, with larger variations in the AH system. The biomass: necromass ratio varied between 1.91 and 2.42 for HG, between 2.27 and 3.29 for AH and between 2.09 and 2.46 for AHS systems. Among all the selected agroforestry systems, concentrations of mineral N (NH4-N and NO3-N) were higher in the AH system and lower in the AHS system while net N mineralization rates were higher in the AHS system. In HGs, FRB it was significantly correlated with ammonification, nitrification and N mineralization while in the AH system it was positively correlated with nitrification and N mineralization. In the AHS system, it was positively correlated with ammonification only. Thus, it can be concluded that in agroforestry systems FRB was enhanced by rapid N mineralization. The variability in FRB and N mineralization between selected agroforestry systems were possibly due to the differences in soil characteristics and management practices. For enrichment of soil nutrients, the contribution of fine roots could be of more importance through the process of decomposition under the prevailing agroforestry systems.

TI  - Soil {Moisture} {Measuring} {Techniques} and {Factors} {Affecting} the {Moisture} {Dynamics}: {A} {Comprehensive} {Review
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - The amount of surface soil moisture (SSM) is a crucial ecohydrological natural resource that regulates important land surface processes. It affects critical landâ€“atmospheric phenomena, including the division of energy and water (infiltration, runoff, and evaporation), that impacts the effectiveness of agricultural output (sensible and latent heat fluxes and surface air temperature). Despite its significance, there are several difficulties in making precise measurements, monitoring, and interpreting SSM at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The current study critically reviews the methods and procedures for calculating SSM and the variables influencing measurement accuracy and applicability under different fields, climates, and operational conditions. For laboratory and field measurements, this study divides SSM estimate strategies into (i) direct and (ii) indirect procedures. The accuracy and applicability of a technique depends on the environment and the resources at hand. Comparative research is geographically restricted, although precise and economicalâ€”direct measuring techniques like the gravimetric method are time-consuming and destructive. In contrast, indirect methods are more expensive and do not produce measurements at the spatial scale but produce precise data on a temporal scale. While measuring SSM across more significant regions, ground-penetrating radar and remote sensing methods are susceptible to errors caused by overlapping data and atmospheric factors. On the other hand, soft computing techniques like machine/deep learning are quite handy for estimating SSM without any technical or laborious procedures. We determine that factors, e.g., topography, soil type, vegetation, climate change, groundwater level, depth of soil, etc., primarily influence the SSM measurements. Different techniques have been put into practice for various practical situations, although comparisons between them are not available frequently in publications. Each method offers a unique set of potential advantages and disadvantages. The most accurate way of identifying the best soil moisture technique is the value selection method (VSM). The neutron probe is preferable to the FDR or TDR sensor for measuring soil moisture. Remote sensing techniques have filled the need for large-scale, highly spatiotemporal soil moisture monitoring. Through self-learning capabilities in data-scarce areas, machine/deep learning approaches facilitate soil moisture measurement and prediction. Â© 2022 by the authors.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) enable noninvasive determination of field-scale soil moisture content by exploiting the dependence of the intensity of aboveground epithermal neutrons on the hydrogen contained in soil moisture. However, there are other hydrogen pools besides soil moisture (e.g., biomass). Therefore, these hydrogen pools should be considered for accurate soil moisture content measurements, especially when they are changing dynamically (e.g., arable crops, deforestation, and reforestation). In this study, we test four approaches for the correction of biomass effects on soil moisture content measurements with CRNS using experiments with three crops (sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize) based on high-quality reference soil moisture: (a) site-specific functions based on in-situ measured biomass, (b) a generic approach, (c) the thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio (Nr), and (d) the thermal neutron intensity. Bare soil calibration of the CRNS resulted in high root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.097, 0.041, and 0.019 mÂ³/mÂ³ between estimated and reference soil moisture content for sugar beet, winter wheat, and maize, respectively. Considering in-situ measured biomass for correction reduced the RMSE to 0.015, 0.018, and 0.009 mÂ³/mÂ³. The consideration of thermal neutron intensity for correction was similarly accurate. We also explored the use of CRNS for biomass estimation and found that Nr only provided accurate biomass estimates for sugar beet. In contrast, we found significant site-specific relationships between biomass and thermal neutron intensity for all three crops, suggesting that thermal neutron intensity can be used both to improve CRNS-based soil moisture content measurements and to quantify crop biomass.

AB  - Organic farming systems have become widespread in recent decades due to their popularity with consumers and their beneficial effects on the environment and biodiversity. Through the increasing number of available studies from farm surveys and comparable results from long-term field trials, the various real existing forms and intensities of agricultural management were subjected to a closer examination in this review. In this paper, the mean characteristics and the range of variation in crop productivity, crop quality and soil fertility as well as the importance and the extent of environmental impacts are comparatively analyzed. From widespread cultivation systems and forms of nutrient management from Central Europe with a focus on Germany, the following fields of influence were investigated and conclusions for the future optimal design of organic cultivation methods were listed: site, soil conditions, climate, phases of conversion and consolidation, crop rotations and farm structures, application of organic and mineral fertilizer types.

VL  - 18

AB  - Soil testing is a unique tool for finding the available soil reaction (pH), organic carbon, and nutrient status of the soil. It helps to select the suitable crops concerning available pH and soil nutrients level to increase crop production. In this current approach, the soil test prediction is used to differentiate several soil features like soil fertility indices of available pH, organic carbon, electrical conductivity, macro nutrients, and micronutrients. The classification and prediction of the soil parameters lead to reducing the artificial fertilizer inputs, increasing crop yield, improving soil health and crop growth, and increasing profitability. These problems are solved by using fast learning and classification techniques known as machine learning (ML) classifier techniques such as random forest, Gaussian naÃ¯ve Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, and support vector machine. After the analysis, decision tree classifier attains the maximum performance to solve all problems which goes above 80\% followed by other classifiers. Copyright Â© 2022, IGI Global.

TI  - Post-harvest soil nutrient prediction in hybrid castor ({Ricinus} communis l.) cropping sequence using a multivariate analysis technique
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - In the era of precision agriculture, the fertilizer prescription based on the soil fertility status is much required. Analyzing the soil after each crop is necessary for fertilizer recommendation and developing an alternative technique to forecast the soil available nutrient value rather than analyzing the soil. Multiple linear regression (MLR) equation was developed using filed experiment data to predict the soil available nutrient in castor cropping sequence. The post-harvest soil available nutrient was considered as the dependent variable and the initially available soil nutrient values, fertilizer added, yield and nutrient uptake of castor as an independent variable. In general, the post-harvest soil nutrient model's prediction accuracy was notable and had a coefficient of determination of less than 0.90. By calculating the RMSE (root means square error), R2 value, the ratio performance to deviation (RPD) and, RE (relative error) the performance of the MLR model was confirmed.Using the validated model, post-harvest soil available nutrients were predicted and compared with laboratory tested soil available nutreints. It turned out that the estab-lished model is more precisely effective and equally precise. Fertilizer recommendation could be made to subsequent crop after hybrid castor using the predicted soil available nutrients. Â©: Author (s). Publishing rights @ ANSF.

TI  - Estimation of soil moisture from {UAS} platforms using {RGB} and thermal imaging sensors in arid and semi-arid regions
VL  - 1335
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a connective hydrological variable between the Earth's surface and atmosphere and affects various climatological processes. Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a key component for addressing energy and water exchanges and can be estimated using different techniques, such as in situ and remote sensing (RS) measurements. Discrete, costly and prolonged, in situ measurements are rarely capable in demonstration of moisture fluctuations. On the other hand, current high spatial resolution satellite sensors lack the spectral resolution required for many quantitative RS applications, which is critical for heterogeneous covers. RS-based unmanned aerial systems (UASs) represent an option to fill the gap between these techniques, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. In the present study, SM was estimated through a UAS equipped with a thermal imaging sensor. To this aim, in October 2018, two airborne campaigns during day and night were carried out with the thermal sensor for the estimation of the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) over an agricultural field in Iran. Simultaneously, SM measurements were obtained in 40 sample points in the different parts of the study area. Results showed a good correlation (R2=0.81) between the estimated and observed SM in the field. This study demonstrates the potential of UASs in providing high-resolution thermal imagery with the aim to monitor SM over bare and scarcely vegetated soils. A case study based in a wide agricultural field in Iran was considered, where SM monitoring is even more critical due to the arid and semi-arid climate, the lack of adequate SM measuring stations, and the poor quality of the available data.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - GIS-based spatial interpolation techniques are utilized in soil sciences to analyze and predict the soil quality in precession agriculture. This research involved the analysis of seventy soil samples at depths of up to 40 centimeters from randomly selected farm plots surrounded by an area of 300ha from the Tarakeswar block in Hooghly region, West Bengal, India during the post-harvest period 2019-2020. Current work assigns the five spatial interpolation techniques namely IDW, RBF, LPI, OK, and EBK for the prediction of soil nutrients on a local scale with the site-specific soil management through GPS-aided Geographical Information System. The accuracy of different interpolation techniques examines by the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) through the cross-validation method. Exponential models were appropriate to the experimental semivariograms for the soil OC, Zn, pH, EC, K, Sand, Silt, and Clay while P and N were best suited to the Gaussian model. The outcomes demonstrate that LPI and EBK is the most preferred method with the highest R2 and smallest RMSE value for interpolation of spatial variability of soil nutrients parameters distribution. It is widely believed that soil variability is an instrument that can help improve the management of land and reduce conflicts within the rural community. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Delineating soil nutrient management zones based on optimal sampling interval in medium- and small-scale intensive farming systems
VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients vary greatly and information regarding their spatial-temporal variability is critical for achieving site-specific nutrient management. However, the problem is that the high cost of soil sampling and laboratory analysis limits the number of samples current research budgets can afford. Besides, large sampling intervals sometimes fail to capture the variability of typical soil properties. Consequently, determining a reasonable yet feasible sampling interval to characterize the spatial variation of soil properties is greatly needed to delineate soil nutrient management zones (MZs). For this purpose, this study used four sampling intervals, 25 m Ã— 25 m, 50 m Ã— 50 m, 75 m Ã— 75 m, and 100 m Ã— 100 m by resampling the raw data acquired from seven adjacent fields located in Quzhou County to estimate the optimal design of soil sampling. Five soil properties (pH, electrical conductivity, extractable phosphorus, extractable potassium, and soil organic matter) were selected to delineate MZs using principal component analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The results indicated that indigenous P and K varied significantly, with the coefficients of variation of 34.33\% and 24.01 \%, respectively. The findings suggested that the optimal soil sampling interval was 50 m to accurately delineate MZs in medium- and small-scale farmlands. Besides, findings also demonstrated that site-specific P and K management could save approximately 21 kg P haâˆ’1 and 30 kg K haâˆ’1 as compared to conventional farming practices while ensuring target yield. The results can help make precision P and K management decisions in medium- and small-scale farming systems.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture condition of paddy fields by using optical remote sensing imagery
VL  - 1109
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is essential in monitoring agricultural lands, particularly in Jember, East Java which serves as one of Indonesian rice-producing regions. Scarcity of information related to the environment crucial to rice planting is evident. This includes detailed growth phase and soil moisture, where their estimation could be done through exploiting remote sensing data. This study aims to estimate soil moisture condition on paddy fields in selected study areas by applying Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data, acquired in 2021. Thermal band of Landsat 8 was utilized to derive the Soil Moisture Index (SMI). This study also investigated the variation of vegetation index (studied using NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) as parameters related to soil moisture conditions. Paddy fields in the study area were dominated by moderate soil moisture levels, with average SMI of 0.47, NDVI=0.45, and about 22Â°C temperature. The SMI ranged from 0.21 to 0.65. The low SMI values indicate low vegetation density and high surface temperature in paddy lands. This research suggested that SMI from Landsat 8 could serve as an efficient approach in monitoring soil moisture condition and understanding its correlation to surface temperature and vegetation condition in agricultural areas, particularly paddy fields.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In this article, the frequency range, within which the dependence of reflectivity on soil moisture is invariant respect to changes in soils texture, dry bulk density and organic matter content, has been established. The analysis is based on dielectric measurements of 16 natural mineral nonsaline soils in the frequency range from 45-100 MHz to 2 GHz. The moisture of soils varied from air dry to the field capacity. The clay, silt and sand content in the soil samples are ranging from 0\% to 76\%, from 1\% to 93\%, and from 0 to 100\%, respectively. The dry bulk density and organic matter content in soil samples are ranging from 0.7 g/cm3 to 1.8g/cm3, and from 0.6\% to 69\%, respectively. As a result, it is shown, that the variations in texture, dry bulk density, and organic matter content of soils have the least effect in the frequency range from 125 MHz to 820 MHz (with minimum at a frequency of 350 MHz) on the dispersion of the dependence of refractive index on volumetric moisture. As an example, the case of smooth bare soil surface remote sensing at a frequency of 435 MHz is considered. It is shown that for the entire set of soils, a single calibration curve for conversion of reflectivity to volumetric soil moisture is sufficient to retrieve soil moisture with a root-mean square error of 2.1\% and a determination coefficient of 0.981. The established frequency range can be recommended for microwave remote sensing methods of soil moisture measurement, not depended on soils texture. Â© 2022 IEEE.

Direct measurement of soil water content, such as the gravimetric method on large areas, requires time and cost. The remote sensing technology can potentially be applied for measuring a large area. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been studied to measure soil water content. However, the presence of vegetation can act as an obstacle and significantly influence the detection results. This influence can cause a decrease in the accuracy of the detection results. Therefore, the presence of vegetation needs to be considered in estimating the soil water content. This paper proposes an extraction method for estimating soil water content considering the presence of vegetation. The proposed method is applied for the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system employed as a radar system used in soil water content estimation. The theoretical and simulation analysis was conducted to investigate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method overcomes the problem of vegetation in soil water content estimation. The accuracy improvement that obtains is about 4.248\%. The proposed method also performs well in the low SNR condition. Â© 2022 IEEE.

VL  - 2022-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Technologies such as radiometry, radar or synthetic aperture radar have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing to observe the Earth's land surface and estimate variables that influence the climate system. Among the remote sensed variables, soil moisture has be-come increasingly important as the impacts of climate change on water resources continue to intensify. Soil moisture products, nor-mally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Providing accurate information on soil moisture at an appropriate temporal and spatial scale is challenging for traditional interpolation methods, due to the high variability of soil moisture. Aiming to provide fine resolution soil moisture es-timations, in this paper we evaluate the performance of our proposed graph-based downscaling method to obtain fine resolution soil moisture data (9km) from coarse satellite observations (9km) using very fine resolution evapotranspiration data (30m). Our approach for-mulates the data interpolation problem as a signal reconstruction on a graph, where coarse soil moisture observations are signals at the nodes, while high resolution evapotranspiration data is used to compute the weights of the edges connecting the nodes.

AB  - Soil fertility is an important factor in determining soil quality as it reflects how well the soil can support plant growth in agriculture. Soil sensor and Arduino can be used to quickly determine the nutrient content of the soil. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are all considered as important nutrient source components. These components should be measured in order to determine how much extra nutrient content should be added to the soil in order to increase the crop fertility. Soil fertility can be detected by using NPK sensors. Soil nutrient concentration data can help us to determine whether the soil used to support plant production is nutrition deficient or abundant. The nutrient content of the soil samples can be obtained in various ways by using sensing element or mass spectrogram. However, the spectral analysis method is inconvenient, where the records are only 60-70\% accurate. By comparing the spectrum analysis method with classic wet chemistry methods, the accuracy of the products needs to be fully resolved due to a scarcity of data. Hence, to detect soil nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, a soil NPK sensor should be used. By utilizing a soil NPK sensor, which is of limited cost, fast and easy, elevated, and transportable. Its advantage over a standard detection approach is that it provides extremely fast measurements with accurate data. This paper analyzes and compares different nutrient levels in soil by using kernel density estimation algorithm and machine learning. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Comparison of soil phosphorus index systems for grassland in the cross-border region of {Ireland
VL  - 185
SN  - NA
AB  - Background: The use of soil phosphorus (P) tests and index systems provides a guide for agronomic nutrient requirements and is frequently also used to estimate risk of P losses to watercourses. Use of soil testing and management based on the results thereof is mandated in some regions. Several P extraction methods are available which evaluate different P pools and are designed for particular soil types. Further to this, index systems categorising specific ranges of plant-available P, differ. Hence, translation between different tests and index systems is not straightforward. In cross-border regions, where hydrologic basins encompass more than one political jurisdiction, different tests and rules are implemented in adjacent lands. This can create disparities in land management, confusion as to what legislation applies and obscures the impacts of best management practices at catchment scale. Aims: The aim of this research was to compare the Morgan's and Olsen soil tests used to quantify plant-available P and the respective index systems, in a border region of the Republic of Ireland (ROI) â€“ Northern Ireland (NI). Methods: Olsen, Morgans and water extractable P (WEP) were evaluated (n = 1,038). Statistical analysis was conducted to derive conversion equations to translate between the statutory test methods and comparison of the respective index categories was performed. Results: The conversion equations compared favourably with previous attempts. A stronger relationship was observed between Morgan P and WEP (R2 = 0.60) than between Olsen P and WEP (R2 = 0.45) (including pH and site as interaction factors). The ROI index system was found to indicate lower levels of plant available P in the soil compared to the NI system, for the same soils. Conclusions: The differences in categorisation of P availability using either index system creates differences in fertiliser recommendations and also perceived aquatic risks even within small cross-border catchments. This study points to a wider implication for international cross-border catchments, suggesting that evaluation of the relationships between adjacent national soil index systems is required to achieve harmonised management of shared waterbodies. Neither index system is preferred, but a combination of soil P tests incorporating both agronomic and environmentally oriented analyses may have utility in future decision support tools.

VL  - 2022-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter affecting environmental processes such as hydrology, ecology and climate. Microwave remote sensing is an effective means of surface soil moisture measurement. Aiming at the influence of vegetation cover in the process of surface soil moisture inversion of winter wheat farmland by microwave remote sensing, a cooperative inversion method using multi-source remote sensing data is proposed in this paper. Thirty-three feature parameters are extracted from Radarsat-2 full polarization SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data, and ten parameters with high correlation with soil moisture are selected to participate in soil moisture inversion by Pearson correlation analysis. Combined with the ground sampling data, four machine learning models, including Random Forest, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Radial Basis Function and Extreme Learning Machine, are used for quantitative inversion of soil moisture to reduce the impact of vegetation and improve the inversion accuracy. The experimental results show that the Random Forest model is the optimal. The average of determination coefficient is 0.63959, and the average of root mean square error is 0.0317 cm3 / cm3, which provides a reference for the inversion of soil moisture in farmland using multi-source remote sensing data.

TI  - Soil water content measurement using polymer optical fibre {Bragg} gratings
VL  - 174
SN  - NA
AB  - Measuring soil water content is crucially important and can affect soil strength, which is a key parameter in the analysis, design and monitoring of geo-structures. In this study, an optical fibre Bragg grating sensor inscribed in polymer optical fibre was developed, and for the first time, its ability to measure soil water content was investigated. The sensitivity of the sensor to different values of gravimetric soil water content under the different compaction conditions of loose and normal compaction was tested. The effect of soil temperature on the sensor's performance was considered. To assess the sensor's implementation, accuracy and reliability, a commercial soil water content probe (SM150), which measures volumetric soil water content was employed. The results indicate that the developed sensor, when calibrated correctly, is able to provide detailed data on any minor variation of soil water content (e.g. 0.5\%) with high precision. The outcomes of this study define an additional capability of the polymer optical fibre Bragg grating sensors, which is significantly important for the long-term performance monitoring of geo-structures.

TI  - Increase in plant productivity and soil fertility based on monitoring studies in the system of test polygons
VL  - 43
SN  - NA
AB  - The work presents the formation of a system for assessing soil fertility and plant development using test monitoring polygons. Monitoring polygons became the basis for the introduction of modern technologies to increase plant productivity and soil fertility. The monitoring sites were located in the main agro-climatic regions of the Leningrad Region on soil types typical for the respective region. Analysis of the dynamics of the main parameters of soil fertility in test plots shows a tendency towards a decrease in the content of mobile forms of potassium and acidification of soils, as well as other signs of degradation. A decrease in soil fertility is associated with a decrease in the proportion of applied fertilizers and a decrease in soil liming. This process develops on all types of soils, with the exception of those areas that are located in suburban farms. The data for the test sites are consistent with the overall results of the agrochemical surveys. For industrial practice, test sites and information collected on them can serve as "information keys" for decoding space and aerial photographs in order to assess the state of agroecosystems, monitor changes in soil fertility and plant development. On the example of the cultivation of spring wheat, the way of precision assessment of the management of the productivity of cultivated crops and the increase of soil fertility is shown. The mechanism for the implementation of the plant productivity management system was carried out with the introduction of elements of precision farming. Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - With the continuous development of agricultural informatization and mechanized high-tech, the degree of agricultural automation is increasing. The single-chip microcomputer equipment has many advantages such as diverse functions, simple circuits, and low cost, and has broad market prospects. Therefore, the measurement of soil moisture and fertility based on single-chip microcomputers can be widely used in the market. This design is the design of soil moisture and fertility detection system. The system uses STC89C52 microcontroller as the control center of the system, uses the YL-69 humidity sensor as the soil humidity sensor module, uses the JXBS-3001-NPK soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium three-in-one fertility sensor as the soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium sensor module, and uses LCD12864 The display is used as the display module of the system, the buzzer is used as the notification module, and the button module is used to set the upper and lower limit values of the preset value of soil moisture and fertility. The soil moisture signal is collected through the YL-69 humidity sensor, the soil fertility signal is collected through the JXBS-3001-NPK soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium three-in-one fertility sensor, and the single chip STC89C52 processes the signal and outputs the control signal to control the Buzzer sounds. At the same time, the single-chip microcomputer sends the data that is not within the range of our preset value to the display screen to make a mark. Â© 2022 SPIE.

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility status in cotton-based cropping systems in {Cote} dâ€™{Ivoire
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Cotton is the main cash crop in northern CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, where intensive cultivation along with low external inputs has led to a decline in crop yields due to soil degradation. The present study aims to assess the evolution of soil fertility during the 2013 and 2021 periods in the cotton basin area of CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire. More specifically, the study (i) identified the limiting physico-chemical parameters of soil fertility, and (ii) analysed the state of evolution of soil fertility in 2013 and 2021 in the cotton basin of CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire. For this purpose, a total of 64 soil samples were taken in 2013 and in 2021 on the same cotton plots on the 0-20 cm horizon. Chemical analyses of the soil samples in the laboratory were carried out on the following parameters: particle size distribution, pH water, total nitrogen (NT), Potassium (K+), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Sodium (Na+) and Cation exchange capacity (CEC). The results of the soil analyses showed that the sandy-clay textured topsoils dominate the whole study area in both years. This leads to a low retention capacity of exchangeable bases. Determination of the soil pH showed that the pH varies from slightly acidic to neutral (6.5{\textless}pH{\textless}7). The most limiting chemical properties are Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the sum of the exchangeable bases (SEB) in the department of Korogho, Boundiali, and Ferkessedougou and the most limiting chemical properties in the department of Mankono are CEC. However, during the period from 2013 to 2021 the content of exchangeable cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) and the base saturation (BS) increased significantly in all the departments, more precisely in the department of Mankono. Although we observed a slight increase in the chemical properties of the soils in 2021 compared to 2013, the values were still below the minimum required threshold. This result implies that the soils have poor physico-chemical properties and consequently a low level of fertility, which compromises the sustainability of the cotton production system. The application of organic and mineral amendments is therefore essential to increase the nutrient content of these soils.

TI  - RapidMapper} â€“ a mobile multi-sensor platform for the assessment of soil fertility in precision agriculture
VL  - 2022
SN  - NA
AB  - A rapid, accurate and high-resolution assessment of soil properties is essential for managing soil fertility through locally adapted tillage, fertilizer and pesticide application in precision agriculture. Soil mapping using proximal soil sensors is a time-and cost-efficient alternative to standard sampling and laboratory analyses. However, because of the complex nature of soils, a single sensor may not be able to provide sufficient data for an accurate estimation of soil attributes. By integrating multiple proximal sensing technologies in a single multi-sensor platform, measuring simultaneously, fusing the sensor data and applying machine learning algorithms, the performance of soil property estimations can be improved. To evaluate the performance of sensor fusion using the most relevant soil sensors, a multi-sensor platform for on-the-go topsoil mapping called RapidMapper was developed. We describe its functionalities and present an initial evaluation of the sensor data fusion. Prediction performance for pH, soil texture, organic matter and sulphur by fused sensor data was superior as compared to single sensor data. Â© 2022, VDI Verlag GMBH. All rights reserved.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Long-term near-surface soil moisture (SM) data can be obtained on a regional scale through microwave remote sensing. Therefore, to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of multisource remote sensingâ€“based observation products, improve the retrieval algorithm, and effectively use in terminal environments, a standardized comprehensive evaluation is imperative. The SM data obtained by the China Meteorological Administration and Ministry of Water Resources were used as reference data to verify the performance of six passive microwave remote sensingâ€“based SM products from the SMOS, SMAP, GCOM-W, FY-3B, and FY-3C satellites in Hunan province, China. These data were also used to analyze the effects of topographical, land cover, and meteorological factors on SM retrieval accuracy. Results show that SMAP shows the best overall performance in Hunan province; furthermore, it exhibits stable accuracy and is not easily affected by environmental factors. The FY series of satellite products shows the worst performance, and some grid remote sensing data are negatively correlated with the ground measurement data. AMSR2 possesses the largest amount of data and the largest deviation, and only this product exhibits significant differences with the fluctuation trend of the measured SM and precipitation. Passive microwave detection technology presents the best performance in the central part of Hunan province and the largest bias in the Dongting Lake area. SMOS-L3 and SMOS-IC, two products of the same satellite, show the lowest bias but present differences in the SM fluctuation range, orbital accuracy, as well as dry or wet bias. Furthermore, FY-3B and FY-3C, two satellites belonging to the same series, exhibit excellent consistency in performance. The evaluation results and accuracy variation between products as well as other factors identified in the study provide a baseline reference for improving the retrieval algorithm. This study provides a quantitative basis for developing improved applications of passive microwave SM products. Copyright Â© 2022 Fan, Han, Tan and Li.

TI  - A first-year melon/cowpea intercropping system improves soil nutrients and changes the soil microbial community
VL  - 328
SN  - NA
AB  - The melon/cowpea intercropping system can be a specific and efficient cropping pattern in a horticultural field. Intercropping systems contribute to the optimization of land use, fostering sustainable and efficient agriculture. This study entails a first-year comparative intercropping assay using cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and melon (Cucumis melo) under organic management with different patterns and 30\% less organic fertilization than usual in monocrops. We determined the soil nutrients, physicochemical properties, enzyme activities and microbes by high-throughput sequencing. We found that the intercropping system changed the bacterial community structure independently of the intercropping pattern. The bacterial community was characterized by a higher abundance of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla and of the genus Pseudomonas, which are related to nutrient cycling, and by greater amounts of other beneficial microorganisms like Bacillus, Streptomyces and Sphingomonas. The intercropped systems significantly boosted the total nitrogen, available phosphorus and total organic carbon levels in addition to the melon yield. They also enhanced the acid phosphatase and Î²-glucosidase activity compared to the melon monocrop. Results from this study suggest that melon/cowpea intercropping, starting from the first year, not only provides a stable supply of food and income due to the diversified cropping systems, but is also beneficial for the soil microbial community and environment.

TI  - Uptake of integrated soil fertility management technologies in heterogeneous smallholder farms in sub-humid tropics
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Low soil fertility strongly affects environmental sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a potential remedy for declining soil fertility. We addressed determinants of ISFM technologies and identified the sources of soil fertility information using cluster and ordered probit analyses in two counties of the Central Highlands of Kenya. In Tharaka-Nithi county, the uptake of ISFMclass1 (Animal manure +anti-erosion + inorganic fertilizer +crop rotation + legume intercrop), positively correlated with membership to cooperatives, religious groups, SACCOs, and ownership of wheelbarrow but negatively associated with gender, level of education, low farming experience and increased off-farm income. The uptake of ISFMclass2 (Compost +Tithonia diversifolia +minimum tillage +agroforestry + crop residue retention) significantly correlated with religious group membership and ownership of radio. The uptake of ISFMclass3 (sole green manure) positively correlated with a household with an adult offering outside labor but negatively associated with distance to agro-dealers. In Murang'a, ISFMclass2 (Animal manure +inorganic fertilizer +anti-erosion + legume intercrop) is positively associated with farmers' age, membership to cooperatives, television ownership, and access to handhoe and distance to tarmacked roads. Access to drought power, distance to tarmacked road, and buyers positively correlated with ISFMclass1 (Agroforestry +green manure +minimum tillage +crop residue retention + crop rotation). There was a positive correlation between access to drought power and uptake of ISFMclass3 that combined compost and Tithonia diversifolia. We conclude that the region's uptake of unique ISFM combinations is influenced by socioeconomic, bio-physical determinants, and farmers' perception of soil fertility status. We thus recommend that increased upscaling of uptake of unique combinations of ISFM technologies require robust collaboration among various local development stakeholders to address the prohibitive factors while strengthening enabling ones.

TI  - In situ detection of soil moisture content based on thermal infrared technology and thermal inertia model
VL  - 12258
SN  - NA
AB  - Our country is a developing country dominated by agriculture, and the trade of agricultural and sideline products accounts for a considerable proportion in China's national economy. Soil moisture content is one of the basic parameters reflecting soil fertility and crop growth in agricultural production activities. The detection of soil moisture content plays an extremely important role in improving soil utilization and increasing crop yield. At the same time, thermal infrared technology has the characteristics of wide acquisition range, high acquisition accuracy, fast information transmission speed and less affected by interference factors. It provides a new method for in-situ detection of soil moisture. In this paper, infrared thermal imaging technology is used to detect the soil in the measured area in situ, which not only avoids the influence of traditional drying method on the sample in the sampling process, but also improves the detection accuracy. The combination of thermal imaging technology and thermal inertia model makes it suitable for the detection of soil moisture content under most environmental conditions, including bare soil, sandy land and low vegetation coverage.

AB  - The effects of three drip irrigation (IR1: Farmerâ€™s, IR2:Full (100\%ETc), IR3:Deficit (80\%ETc) irrigation), and two fertilization (Ft1, Ft2) treatments were studied on maize yield and biomass by applying new agro-technologies (TDRâ€”sensors for soil moisture (SM) measurements, Precision Agriculture, Remote Sensingâ€”NDVI (Sentinel-2 satellite sensor), soil-hydraulic analyses and Geostatistical models, SM-rootzone modelling-2D-GIS mapping). A daily soil moisture depletion (SMDp) model was developed. The two-way-ANOVA statistical analysis results revealed that irrigation (IR3 = best) and fertilization treatments (Ft1 = best) significantly affect yield and biomass. Deficit irrigation and proper fertilization based on new agro-technologies for improved management decisions can result in substantial improvement on yield (+116.10\%) and biomass (+119.71\%) with less net water use (âˆ’7.49\%) and reduced drainage water losses (âˆ’41.02\%).

VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - Wise management of indigenous resources replenishes soil nutrients and improves crop productivity and soil sustainability. Three year consecutive experiments were performed in the framework of Farmers Field School (FFS) during 2012â€“2014. Organic nitrogen sources [animal-urine (AU), animal-manures (AM), and animal manure-compost (AMC) with two application methods [interior-application method (IAM) and exterior-application method (EAM)] and three sowing timing [early sowing (ES), late-sowing (LS), and timely sowing (TS)] were studied. One control plot in each replication was placed as a check. The results showed that among different sowing time, TS has higher grains yearâˆ’1, 1000 grains weight, dry biomass, grain yield and harvest index (HI) than LS and ES. AM delayed silking and physiological maturation. A higher grains yearâˆ’1, 1000 grains weight, grain yield, total dry biomass, and HI were observed with AMC than control plots. In application methods, the IAM has delayed the silking and physiological maturity as compared to EAM. Similarly, higher grains yearâˆ’1, 1000 grains weight, grain yield, dry biomass, and HI were observed with IAM than EAM. In sowing timing, higher grain nitrogen (GN) was observed in TS. Higher GN produced by AMC and AU treated plots. AMC produced 10\% higher GN than manures treated plots. The IAM produced higher GN than EAM. The AMC produced significantly higher soil N and statistically at par with AU treated plots. IAM applied AMC, maize grain yield was higher than the AU and AM. In conclusion, AMC and AU embedded in soil with TS can sustainably increase maize yield and soil productivity. Â© 2022 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Effects of potassium fertilization on crops yield, potassium uptake, and soil potassium fertility in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems
VL  - 68
SN  - NA
AB  - To determine the impact of K fertilization on crop yields and soil K supplying capacity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation, four field experiments were conducted with five K fertilizer rates: 0 (K0), 90â€“147 (K1), 180â€“210 (K2), 270â€“300 (K3) and 336â€“390 (K4) kg K2O haâˆ’1 per rotation. Compared with K0, adding K increased the yield of rice and oilseed rape by 4.2â€“8.9\% and 7.5â€“32.6\%, respectively. Potassium fertilization increased K uptake at four sites, whereas yields remained stagnant in K2, K3, and K4 treatments despite increasing K uptake. Continuous K removal decreased soil K supplying capacity. For the 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm soil depths, the NH4OAc-K and boiling HNO3-K at the harvest were decreased in K0 and K1 treatments, whereas it maintained or increased in K2, K3, and K4 treatments, although negative K balances were recorded at all sites. It suggests that application 180â€“210 kg K2O haâ€“1 in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems improved crop yield and maintained soil potassium fertility.

VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Centella asiatica L. urban is one of the highly traded medicinal crops in the global market and it is collected mainly from wild sources/forests. The scope for commercial cultivation of elite genotypes of C. asiatica at different nutrient levels was assessed based on resource use and economic indicators in open-field and 50\% shade in India during 2016â€“2019. The cumulative productivity in terms of fresh biomass was significantly influenced by genotypes and nutrient levels both in open-field and 50\% shade. The genotype Arka Divya genotype was superior in terms of cumulative productivity per ha (38.5 t in open-field and 33.9 t in 50\% shade). Application of farmyard manure (FYM) 5 t + 125 kg nitrogen (N) through FYM registered higher cumulative yield in open (32.2 t haâˆ’1) and 50\% shade (33.1 t haâˆ’1). The production systems in open and 50\% shade maintained optimum to above optimum soil fertility and plant nutrient profile. The net return per rupee investment was higher in Arka Divya genotype at different nutrient levels in open-field (2.61â€“3.69) as well as 50\% shade conditions (1.38â€“1.96). Integrated application of recommended dose of major nutrients and FYM registered higher net return per rupee investment both in open-field (3.69) and 50\% shade (1.96). The elite genotypes of C. asiatica can be grown profitably in open-field or 50\% shade with provision of optimum nutrition. Alternatively it can be grown as intercrop in perennial fruit or plantation crops with provision of irrigation to reduce production cost. Â© 2022 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 234
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture is an essential parameter for the hydrological modelling of the watershed. Field techniques adopted for soil moisture measurements are laborious and time-consuming. In a watershed, the soil moisture varies both spatially and temporally. Making continuous on-field observations simultaneously at several locations is practically impossible for large watersheds. Soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques is considered a viable alternative. In this study, it is proposed to apply a modified water cloud model for surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval over partially vegetated regions. This method combines the microwave data obtained from Sentinel-I and optical data obtained from Landsat Operational Land Image (OLI) for SSM estimation. It is necessary to remove the effect of vegetation moisture content for better SSM estimation. Therefore, the index derived from the Landsat OLI spectral bands is applied to build a model for the vegetation water content estimation. A modified water cloud model (MWCM) is developed by integrating the vegetation index with the original water cloud model. In this study, the backscatter coefficients measured using the C-band (5.405 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor onboard the Sentinel-IA satellite has been used. The developed MWCM has been used to prepare multi-temporal SSM maps. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The field of agricultural research is extremely important, as India or every farmer worldwide faces numerous problems in increasing crop production. In the context of this situation, many people worked in agriculture, such as soil quality, crop management, irrigation of agriculture, cultivation, harvesting, and pesticide activities. The machine learning approach is a crucial decision-making tool to estimate crop yield and to understand which crops are to be cultivated and what processes to be carried out while growing seasonal crops. This paper focuses on a literature review of different approaches to machine learning to estimate the crop yield and various soil properties. Three categories of soils include physical soil, chemicals, and biological characteristics. A selected agricultural soil and method study and analysis of different soil nutrients for plant prevention, for instance, primary and secondary nutrients. Such an approach will help farmers resolve their crop production problem. Â© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The use of low-cost Internet of Things systems is a possible strategy to monitor the consumption of water used in agriculture even in countries that do not have good economic resources. In this paper, a low-cost system based on a new capacitive measuring approach of soil moisture is proposed. This solution exploits the sensor structure's capacitive properties to respond to the need to measure at the same time salinity and soil volumetric water content. To this purpose, a bi-functional system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated circuit is described. The considered frequency range for impedance measurements is equal to 10-100 kHz, which is a 'low-frequency' range compared with typical operating frequencies of a professional system dedicated to water content measurements. For the sensor, a low-frequency Finite Element Modelling simulation of its electrical behavior has also been considered with the aim to understand how its measured admittance correlates with frequency, soil permittivity, and water conductivity.

The structure and the properties of the film were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dielectric spectroscopy. The soil moisture sensing ability of the polymer film was demonstrated by measuring the dielectric constant of the polymer with soil samples of low and high moisture contents. The results revealed that the film exhibited high moisture sensing properties at frequencies up to a few kHz.

VL  - 209
SN  - NA
AB  - Globally, agriculture seems to be the economic field, which occupies a major part in Indiaâ€™s socio-economic structure. The parameters such as soil and rainfall play a major role in agriculture dependency. Farmers will usually have the mindset of planting the same crop by using more fertilizers and following the public choice. In agriculture, crop productivity will be increased with the incorporation of new technologies. The most commonly used smart farming technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) has the tendency to process the generous quantities of data from these devices. In the recent past, there have been major developments on the utilization of machine learning (ML) in various industries and research. For this reason, machine learning (ML) techniques are considered as the best choice for agriculture, which is then evaluated to predict crop production for the future year. In this paper, the proposed system uses IoT devices to gather information such as soil nutrient level, temperature of atmosphere, season of the atmosphere, soil type, fertilizer used and water pH level periodically. Further, the data gathered from the sensor will be passed to a principal component analysis (PCA), which are used to reduce features in order to obtain a better prediction level. Also, ML algorithms such as linear regression (LR), decision trees (DT) and random forest (RF) are implemented to forecast and classify the crop yield from the previous data based on soil nutrient degradation level and recommend suitable fertilizer for every particular crop.

AB  - Water is becoming a scarce commodity. Therefore, proper water management in precision irrigation is crucial to increase productivity and reduce the cost of crop production. Precision irrigation is based on measuring the soil water content, which is often measured with dielectric sensors that measure the apparent permittivity of the soil. Although the sensors are already equipped with a factory calibration function that converts the measured permittivity into volumetric water content, the function does not work properly for all soil types. It is therefore recommended to check whether a soil-specific calibration is required for accurate soil water content measurements. Precise irrigation also requires adequate determination of soil water retention properties, which can be determined using various procedures and methods. In this paper, we presented the results of applying different approaches to determine soil-specific calibration functions using two types of dielectric sensors (SM150T, Delta-T Devices and MVZ 100, Eltratec) in different soil samples obtained from locations in Slovenia where precision irrigation is performed. In addition, the results of determining the water retention properties of the soil using different methods were also compared. Â© 2022 University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil moisture has a significant influence in the occurrence of drought since it influences the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. This paper discuss about the significance of soil moisture and the estimation of soil moisture index (SMI) using remote sensing. Optical and the thermal spectra is processed in SAGA GIS for the computation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) using thermal band of Landsat 8 and the Normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) using the Red and Near Infrared Band of Landsat 8. A linear regression analysis is performed between LST and the NDVI is to estimate the soil moisture index. The derived soil moisture index is used to map the severity of drought from extreme drought to no drought condition and the results were validated with the NDVI results. The Results shows that the relationship between LST and the NDVI can be utilized to map drought risk areas with the help of Landsat-8 images at a higher resolution which is beneficial for hydrological studies.

AB  - This study proposes an increase in the measurement of soil water content with sensor characterization that can be integrated with the internet of things. The main contribution of this work is the improvement in measurement accuracy compared to measurements using a moisture meter. This is achieved through an electromagnetic approach using a pair of transceiver coils as a sensor. Determination of water content in the soil is carried out through the formulation of an equation model that connects the measured voltage on the receiving coil with the mass of water contained. It is known that the use of the equation model in the test data results in better accuracy with an error of 2.03\% - 17.43\%, compared to measurements using a moisture measuring device with an error of 13.21\% - 32\%. This equation model that uses the electromagnetic method provides an alternative solution for determining the soil water for wider land use so that can be used for internet of things application.

TI  - Point-of-use sensors and machine learning enable low-cost determination of soil nitrogen
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Overfertilization with nitrogen fertilizers has damaged the environment and health of soil, but standard laboratory testing of soil to determine the levels of nitrogen (mainly NH4+ and NO3âˆ’) is not performed regularly. Here we demonstrate that point-of-use measurements of NH4+, combined with soil conductivity, pH, easily accessible weather and timing data, allow instantaneous prediction of levels of NO3âˆ’ in soil (R2 = 0.70) using a machine learning model. A long short-term memory recurrent neural network model can also be used to predict levels of NH4+ and NO3âˆ’ up to 12 days into the future from a single measurement at day one, with RNH4+2=0.60 and RNO3âˆ’2=0.70, for unseen weather conditions. Our machine-learning-based approach eliminates the need for dedicated instruments to determine the levels of NO3âˆ’ in soil. Nitrogenous soil nutrients can be determined and predicted with enough accuracy to forecast the impact of climate on fertilization planning and to tune timing for crop requirements, reducing overfertilization while improving crop yields.

TI  - Geostatistical, deterministic and interpolation with barriers methodsâ€”a comparative analysis for interpolating soil {NPK
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - The spatial distribution of soil pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations at Anaimalai block of Coimbatore district, India was interpolated by geostatistical analysis to create digital maps of soil NPK that renders numerous information for agro based policy making. 1627 soil samples in 30,700 acres were gathered by composite soil sampling method and rendered interpolation analysis to predict the soil parameters at unsampled locations. Based on geostatistical, deterministic and interpolation with barriers methods 13 interpolation models were generated and compared to validate the precision. Interpolation reveals the deficiency of soil available nitrogen and phosphorus whereas available potassium was in sufficient range. Radial basis function, inverse distance weighting, probability kriging, empirical Bayesian kriging and local polynomial interpolations were validated by linear correlation method that reveals the precisions of models with R 2 values of 0.74, 0.82, 0.98, 0.89 and 0.79 (soil pH, EC, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium respectively).

TI  - Soil fertility, system productivity and economic viability of coconut based high density multi species cropping system in {Tamil} {Nadu}, {India
VL  - 49
SN  - NA
AB  - Monocropping of coconut is no longer viable in the context of price aberrations of copra, debilitating pests and dreadful diseases and intercropping turned out to be an inevitable venture. A research experiment was pursued at the AICRP (Palms) centre, Coconut Research Station, Aliyarnagar, Tamil Nadu, India during 2013-18 to assess the impact of coconut based High Density Multi Species Cropping System (HDMSCS) with cocoa (CCRP accessions), banana (var. Nendran) and pineapple (var. Kew), on soil fertility, system productivity and economic viability. The experiment was conducted in a sandy clay loam soil taxonomically classified as Typic Haplustepts. Four treatments viz., T1: 75 per cent recommended dose of nutrients (RDN) as chemical fertilizers + 25 per cent RDN through organic recycling with vermicompost, vermiwash application, biofertilizer application and green manuring with gliricidia loppings; T2: 50 per cent RDN as chemical fertilizers with 50 per cent RDN through organic sources, T3: 100 per cent RDN through organic sources and T4: sole chemical fertilization were imposed in blocks comprising of 25 coconut palms per block. Results revealed that integration of 75 per cent recommended dose of nutrients (RDN) through chemical fertilizers and 25 per cent through organic sources (T1) resulted in increased nut yield of coconut, dry bean yield of cocoa and fruit yield of banana and pineapple. Nut yield was conspicuously lower in monocropping compared to HDMSCS. Soil organic carbon (SOC), earthworm count and microbial population were higher in the treatment, which received 100 per cent RDN through organic sources (T3). Net Returns, B: C ratio and employment generation potential were higher in HDMSCS than coconut monoculture. Partitioning of the recommended dose of nutrients through 75 per cent chemical fertilizers and 25 per cent organic manures for coconut based high density multi species cropping integrated with cocoa, banana and pineapple paved the way for enhanced soil fertility, system productivity, profitability and sustainability of coconut system in Western Zone of Tamil Nadu, India.

TI  - Combining farmersâ€™ and scientistsâ€™ tree species and soil fertility assessment for improved cropping decisions in swidden systems of {Northern} {Thailand
VL  - 127
SN  - NA
AB  - Despite increasing pressure on land, many hill tribe communities in Northern Thailand practice traditional swidden agriculture with long fallow periods that allow the soil to recover from cropping. To determine the most appropriate time for a new cropping cycle, farmers, in a collective decision making process, often use presence or numbers of tree species considered as soil fertility indicators. In Nong Khao, a case study village in Mae Hong Son district, we investigated in how far abundance of indicator tree species found during vegetation surveys corresponded to measured soil fertility parameters and whether an extended list of indicator species could improve prediction of these soil properties. During interviews, farmers listed 11 tree species considered indicators for good upland rice and vegetable soil, unsuitable soil for upland rice, or hard soil. Abundances of indicator species as well as of other species found during comprehensive botanical inventories on 135 plots of different fallow ages were introduced into regression models to predict soil fertility parameters measured on the inventoried plots. Both models â€“ including only indicator species versus all species found in the inventories â€“ were compared regarding their predictive power for soil properties. Soil organic matter (SOM), pH, plant available phosphorus (Pav) â€“ related to farmersâ€™ criteria â€˜good soilâ€™ or 'unsuitable for rice croppingâ€™ â€“ as well as bulk density (BD, for â€˜hard soilâ€™), changed significantly during the fallow period, from initial maxima towards temporary pessima in years 6 to 7, followed by recovery towards year ten. Most indicator species, like Macaranga denticulata for enhanced Pav or Dalbergia cultrata for high SOM, were clearly related to the soil quality characteristics attributed to them by farmers. Including all inventoried tree species significantly improved predictions of measured soil parameters by Î”AIC {\textgreater} {\textbar}2{\textbar}. Ten additional species from the surveys had potential as additional indicator species. Our approach to relate indicator species to measured soil parameters is generic across areas, while soil parameters are site-specific. Applicability of our approach to link environmental parameters to indicator species could be extended if further criteria considered important by farmers such as weed suppression, represented by tree structure parameters, would complement soil fertility.

VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - In this study, the interacting effects of shade and planting methods on the growth and competitive ability of two understory plants Heracleum moellendorffii Hance and Adenophora divaricata Franch. \& Sav. were investigated under different soil moisture and nutrient conditions. One-year-old seedlings were subjected to different light levels (0\%, 35\%, and 55\% shade) and planting methods (monoculture and mixed) under contrasting soil moisture (1.2 L/m2 and 2.3 L/m2 of water) and soil nutrient conditions (unfertilized and fertilized). Here, shading significantly improved the height growth of H. moellendorffii (10â€“20 cm increase) in unfertilized and fertilized plots and at high soil moisture conditions. Contrarily, A. divaricata seedlings planted singly at full sunlight yielded a higher aboveground biomass growth (8â€“17 g plantâˆ’1), compared with those shaded and intercropped seedlings (0.9â€“3.9 g plantâˆ’1). The increased competitiveness of H. moellendorffii suppressed the growth of A. divaricata across different light conditions when planted together. The amount of light, soil moisture, and nutrients and their interactions significantly affected the growth of the seedlings, resulting in asymmetric interspecific competition between the two species. Results provide us with a better understanding of the environmental factors affecting plant growth for forest farming in the understory. Â© 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - During tea cultivation, diverse agroforestry is an important and established intercropping measure, with most studies concentrating on ecological service provision and economic returns. However, the response of soil nutrients and microbial community structures in long-term tea plantations with diverse agroforestry intercropping systems is poorly understood. In the present field study (2015), three intercropping agroforestry-tea patterns (Osmanthus-Tea (OT), Michelia-Tea (MT), Osmanthus-Michelia-Tea (OMT)) along with a study control (C) were examined in terms of these two knowledge gaps. Results showed that, in terms of tea cultivation, the OMT system is more suitable than the OT and MT systems. The OMT system significantly increased the total nitrogen (TN, 16.4\%), total potassium (TK, 10.5\%), available nitrogen (AN, 14.2\%), available phosphorus (AP, 26.7\%) and soil organic matter (SOM, 28.9\%). The OMT system increased phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes abundance by 35.8\% and 9.6\%. In addition, the OMT system enhanced the abundance of class Bacteroidia (99.5\%), Erysipelotrichia (96.9\%), Clostridia (93.5\%) and Actinobacteria (19.6\%), respectively. In general, the phylum bacteria Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria accounted for the largest proportion of bacteria in all three intercropping systems. In this study, the abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with AN, SOM and TP. The results of the present study will help to develop a better understanding of the benefits imposed by different agroforestry intercropping systems on nutrient dynamics and microbial structural diversity during tea cultivation.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields from {L}-band multi-incidence and multitemporal {PolSAR} observations using polarimetric decomposition techniques
VL  - 261
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SM) retrieval over agricultural areas from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has long been restricted by vegetation attenuation, simplified polarimetric scattering modelling, and limited SAR measurements. This study proposes a modified polarimetric decomposition framework to retrieve SM from multi-incidence and multitemporal PolSAR observations. The framework is constructed by combining the X-Bragg model, the extended double Fresnel scattering model and the generalised volume scattering model (GVSM). Compared with traditional decomposition models, the proposed framework considers the depolarisation of dihedral scattering and the diverse vegetation contribution. Under the assumption that SM is invariant for the PolSAR observations at two different incidence angles and that vegetation scattering does not change between two consecutive measurements, analytical parameter solutions, including the dielectric constant of soil and crop stem, can be obtained by solving multivariable nonlinear equations. The proposed framework is applied to the time series of L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012. In this study, we assess retrieval performance by comparing the inversion results with in-situ measurements over bean, canola, corn, soybean, wheat and winter wheat areas and comparing the different performance of SM retrieval between the GVSM and Yamaguchi volume scattering models. Given that SM estimation is inherently influenced by crop phenology and empirical parameters which are introduced in the scattering models, we also investigate the influence of surface depolarisation angle and co-pol phase difference on SM estimation. Results show that the proposed retrieval framework provides an inversion accuracy of RMSE{\textless}6.0\% and a correlation of Râ‰¥0.6 with an inversion rate larger than 90\%. Over wheat and winter wheat fields, a correlation of 0.8 between SM estimates and measurements is observed when the surface scattering is dominant. Specifically, stem permittivity, which is retrieved synchronously with SM also shows a linear relationship with crop biomass and plant water content over bean, corn, soybean and wheat fields. We also find that a priori knowledge of surface depolarisation angle, co-pol phase difference and adaptive volume scattering could help to improve the performance of the proposed SM retrieval framework. However, the GVSM model is still not fully adaptive because the co-pol power ratio of volume scattering is potentially influenced by ground scattering. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Improving soil moisture assessment of turfgrass systems utilizing field radiometry
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - The need for water conservation continues to increase as global freshwater resources dwindle. Turfgrass mangers are adapting to these concerns by implementing new tools to reduce water consumption. Time-domain reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture sensors can decrease water usage when scheduling irrigation, but nonuniformity across unsampled locations creates irrigation inefficiencies. Remote sensing data have been used to estimate soil moisture stress in turfgrass systems through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, numerous stressors other than moisture constraints impact NDVI values. The water band index (WBI) is an alternative index that uses narrowband, near-infrared light reflectance to estimate moisture limitations within the plant canopy. The green-to-red ratio index (GRI) is a vegetation index that has been proposed as a cheaper alternative to WBI as it can be measured using digital values of visible light instead of relying on more costly hyperspectral reflectance measurements. A replicated 2 Ã— 3 factorial experimental design was used to repeatedly measure turf canopy reflectance and soil moisture over time as soils dried. Pots of â€˜007â€™ creeping bentgrass (CBG) and â€˜Latitude 36â€™ hybrid bermudagrass (HBG) were grown on three soil textures: United States Golf Association (USGA) 90:10 sand, loam, and clay. Reflectance data were collected hourly between 07:00 and 19:00 using a hyperspectral radiometer and volumetric water content (VWC) data were collected continuously using an embedded soil moisture sensor from soil saturation until complete turf necrosis by drought stress. The WBI had the strongest relationship to VWC (r = 0.62) compared to GRI (r = 0.56) and NDVI (r = 0.47). The WBI and GRI identified significant moisture stress approximately 28 h earlier than NDVI (p = 0.0010). Those metrics also predicted moisture stress prior to fifty percent visual estimation of wilt (p = 0.0317), with lead times of 12 h (WBI) and 9 h (GRI). By contrast, NDVI provided 2 h of prediction time. Nonlinear regression analysis showed that WBI and GRI can be useful for predicting moisture stress of CBG and HBG grown on three different soil textures in a controlled environment.

TI  - Conversion equations between {Olsen}-{P} and other methods used to assess plant available soil phosphorus in {Europe} â€“ {A} review
VL  - 401
SN  - NA
AB  - Plant available soil phosphorus contents are assessed by various different methods worldwide. The resulting country-specific methodology prohibits comparison or joint analysis of international data on yield response to soil P level. A change of the standard method would decrease comparability to older data, require new costly and time-consuming calibration and familiarization of advisory authorities and farmers. The use of conversion equations can allow the combination of data derived by different methods, but large differences between available equations question their reliability. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of conversion options from P extracted by methods commonly used in Europe (acid ammonium acetate, acid ammonium acetate + EDTA, ammonium lactate, calcium acetate lactate, double lactate, H2O and Mehlich 3) to the widely used Olsen method. For a given method of soil P extraction, coefficients derived from different publications often vary by factors above two. Differences in coefficients can, at least to a certain degree, be attributed to variations in soil type, soil texture and especially pH range and carbonate contents of the soils of the according databases. In several studies, decreasing pH values increased Olsen-P values in relation to the other methods. Linear regressions are prone to bias by the right-skewed distribution of P values in most databases and therefore have to be handled with care on the lower end of the P level range. Even the option most appropriate for the soil and research purpose at hand can be a considerable source of error, therefore conversions should only be conducted if absolutely necessary.

TI  - Cacao agroforestry systems improve soil fertility: {Comparison} of soil properties between forest, cacao agroforestry systems, and pasture in the {Colombian} {Amazon
VL  - 314
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of our work was to evaluate soil quality in different cacao agroforestry systems (AFS) in the Colombian Amazon. We compared soil quality of AFS at the study site with soil quality of two control systems: a pasture and a secondary forest. The study was conducted at the Macagual Amazon Research Center in western Colombian Amazon. We set up eight 600 mÂ² plots in each study system. We collected soil samples in each plot, and assessed macrofauna diversity, aggregate morphology, and physical and chemical soil properties. We integrated these variables in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ). We found GISQ values of 0.85 for forest, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.59 for AFS and 0.21 for pasture, and the values differed significantly between land uses. The establishment of cacao AFS on degraded pasture was found to significantly improve soil fertility, i.e., by 42\%. The intensification level between land uses (Pasture {\textgreater} AFS {\textgreater} Forest) negatively affected macrofauna populations due to soil compaction (physical properties). Forest had the highest physical and biological quality. Our results show that AFS not only have the capacity to maintain key soil ecological functions, but also to restore soil quality of degraded pastureland. Cacao-based AFS could therefore be a key restoration strategy for degraded pastureland. These results are very important in the context of the Colombian Amazon, where cacao is currently known as the â€œcrop of peaceâ€. Â© 2021

TI  - Fiber {Optic} {Measurements} of {Soil} {Moisture} in a {Waste} {Rock} {Pile
VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - The design and construction of a waste rock pile influences water infiltration and may promote the production of contaminated mine drainage. The objective of this project is to evaluate the use of an active fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (aFO-DTS) protocol to measure infiltration and soil moisture within a flow control layer capping an experimental waste rock pile. Five hundred meters of fiber optic cable were installed in a waste rock pile that is 70 m long, 10 m wide, and was covered with 0.60 m of fine compacted sand and 0.25 m of non-reactive crushed waste rock. Volumetric water content was assessed by heating the fiber optic cable with 15-min heat pulses at 15 W/m every 30 min. To test the aFO-DTS system 14 mm of recharge was applied to the top surface of the waste rock pile over 4 h, simulating a major rain event. The average volumetric water content in the FCL increased from 0.10 to 0.24 over the duration of the test. The volumetric water content measured with aFO-DTS in the FCL and waste rock was within Â±0.06 and Â±0.03, respectively, compared with values measured using 96 dielectric soil moisture probes over the same time period. Additional results illustrate how water can be confined within the FCL and monitored through an aFO-DTS protocol serving as a practical means to measure soil moisture at an industrial capacity.

TI  - Efficiency of measures and technology to preserve soil fertility and protect the soil from erosion in the steppe regions of the {Southern} {Urals
VL  - 36
SN  - NA
AB  - The main source of soil fertility decline in the arid conditions of the Orenburg region is erosion, which manifests itself to varying degrees over the entire arable land. In the Orenburg region, 2214.9 ha are subject to water erosion, wind erosion - 279.4 ha, and out of a total area of 6240.0 thousand hectares, deflationary hazardous erosion - 5304.3 thousand hectares. In connection with erosion processes, the humus content in the soil decreases by 1-6 tons in southern chernozems, ordinary -1.7\%. The studies were carried out in two stationary areas of the Orenburg Cis-Urals and Trans-Urals in order to determine the efficiency of measures and technologies to preserve soil fertility and protect the soil from erosion in arid conditions. With the transition to contour-landscape agriculture (CLA), the fertility of slope lands and the yield of field crops increases, and the negative effect of drought decreases to a minimum. The decrease in soil fertility caused by the erosion process is recorded in the fallow field when it is allocated for spring wheat. Soil-protecting and green fallows largely eliminate this disadvantage. During the fallowing period as per the data, the field of black fallow accumulates 430 kg per 1 ha of nitrates in the 0-150 cm layer, and when mineral fertilizers are applied at a dose of N40P80, it increases to 689 kg per 1 ha.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring the effects of soil moisture on crop health is important for applications such as irrigation decision support, food security, precision agriculture as well as for more broadly understanding relationships between water and carbon cycles. In this study, we examine the relationships between soil moisture and crop health indicators, how they respond to each other on timescales from days to weeks. The satellite-derived indicators considered are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from reflectance obtained with moderately wide (20-40 nm) spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) and soil moisture products that extends to about 1 m depth from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We find that NDVI have significant correlations with soil moisture in crop fields of Nebraska. Crop types and soil types also greatly influence the correlation between crop health and soil moisture changes at various rates and strength. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Prediction of regional forest soil nutrients based on gaofen-1 remote sensing data
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The study on the spatial distribution of forest soil nutrients is important not only as a reference for understanding the factors affecting soil variability, but also for the rational use of soil resources and the establishment of a virtuous cycle of forest ecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing satellites provides an excellent opportunity to improve the accuracy of forest soil prediction models. This study aimed to explore the utility of the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite in the forest soil mapping model in Luoding City, Yunfu City, Guangdong Province, Southeast China. We used 1000 m resolution coarse-resolution soil map to represent the overall regional soil nutrient status, 12.5 m resolution terrain-hydrology variables to reflect the detailed spatial distribution of soil nutrients, and 8 m resolution remote sensing variables to reflect the surface vegetation status to build terrain-hydrology artificial neural network (ANN) models and full variable ANNs, respec-tively. The prediction objects were alkali-hydro-nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and organic matter (OM) at five soil depths (0â€“20, 20â€“40, 40â€“60, 60â€“80, and 80â€“ 100 cm). The results showed that the full-variable ANN accuracy at five soil depths was better than the terrain-hydrology ANNs, indicating that remote sensing variables reflecting vegetation status can improve the prediction of forest soil nutrients. The remote sensing variables had different effectiveness for different soil nutrients and different depths. In upper soil layers (0â€“20 and 20â€“40 cm), remote sensing variables were more useful for AN, AP, and OM, and were between 10\%â€“14\% (R2), and less effective for AK at only 8\% and 6\% (R2). In deep soil layers (40â€“60, 60â€“80, and 80â€“100 cm), the improvement of all soil nutrient models was not significant, between 3 and 6\% (R2). RMSE and ROA Â± 5\% also decreased with the depth of soil. Remote sensing ANNs (coarse resolution soil maps + remote sensing variables) further demonstrated that the predictive power of remote sensing data decreases with soil depth. Compared to terrain-hydrological variables, remote sensing variables perform better at 0â€“20 cm, but the predictive power decreased rapidly with depth. In conclusion, the results of the study showed that the integration of remote sensing with coarse-resolution soil maps and terrain-hydrology variables could strongly improve upper forest soil (0â€“40 cm) nutrients prediction and NDVI, green band, and forest types were the best remote sensing predictors. In ad-dition, the study area is rich in AN and OM, while AP and AK are scarce. Therefore, to improve forest health, attention should be paid to monitoring and managing AN, AP, AK, and OM levels.

TI  - Spatiooral soil moisture retrieval at the catchment scale using a dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a powerful technique for retrieving representative estimates of soil water content at a horizontal scale of hectometres (the "field scale") and depths of tens of centimetres ("the root zone"). This study demonstrates the potential of the CRNS technique to obtain spatiooral patterns of soil moisture beyond the integrated volume from isolated CRNS footprints. We use data from an observational campaign carried out between May and July 2019 that featured a dense network of more than 20 neutron detectors with partly overlapping footprints in an area that exhibits pronounced soil moisture gradients within one square kilometre. The present study is the first to combine these observations in order to represent the heterogeneity of soil water content at the sub-footprint scale as well as between the CRNS stations. First, we apply a state-of-the-art procedure to correct the observed neutron count rates for static effects (heterogeneity in space, e.g. soil organic matter) and dynamic effects (heterogeneity in time, e.g. barometric pressure). Based on the homogenized neutron data, we investigate the robustness of a calibration approach that uses a single calibration parameter across all CRNS stations. Finally, we benchmark two different interpolation techniques for obtaining spatiooral representations of soil moisture: first, ordinary Kriging with a fixed range; second, spatial interpolation complemented by geophysical inversion ("constrained interpolation"). To that end, we optimize the parameters of a geostatistical interpolation model so that the error in the forward-simulated neutron count rates is minimized, and suggest a heuristic forward operator to make the optimization problem computationally feasible. Comparison with independent measurements from a cluster of soil moisture sensors (SoilNet) shows that the constrained interpolation approach is superior for representing horizontal soil moisture gradients at the hectometre scale. The study demonstrates how a CRNS network can be used to generate coherent, consistent, and continuous soil moisture patterns that could be used to validate hydrological models or remote sensing products.

TI  - Soil {Fertility} {Appraisal} for {Pea} {Growing} {Regions} of {Himachal} {Pradesh} using {GPS} and {GIS} {Techniques
VL  - 55
SN  - NA
AB  - Background: Overexploitation of productive lands creates serious problem of lowering the fertility status of soil and it leads to deterioration of soil. The deficiency of nutrients directly affects on the growth of crops and crop response become poor. Pea crop, like other plants, need different nutrients in varying quantities to achieve optimum growth and productivity. Soil fertility and its productivity are mainly affected by soil properties and nutrient status. Hence, it is necessary to assess the fertility status of soil with the consideration of available nutrients in soils and to recommend the specific nutrients for the proper management of soil. Methods: In this field-laboratory investigation during 2017-2019, about 135 geo-referenced soil samples were collected from 49 pea growing locations/ villages of Gohar and Sundernagar blocks of Mandi district. The collected (0-15 cm) soil samples were analyzed for different soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon and available N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn content. Different thematic maps were prepared using Arc-GIS software version 10.2.1. Result: The investigations revealed that the soils were acidic to neutral in soil reaction and are in safe limits of electrical conductivity as the values were less than 0.8 dS m-1. Soil organic carbon status was found to be medium to high in surface layer. About 94.8 and 22.2\% soil samples were recorded deficient in available N and Zn, whereas K, Cu and Zn were moderate in 53.3, 28.1 and 55.6\% samples, respectively. On the basis of coefficient of variation, the soil pH and exchangeable Ca are least variable, whereas, available nutrients like N, Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn are moderately variable. However, electrical conductivity, OC, available P, K, S, Cu and Zn are highly variable in the samples under investigation. This information will also help to adopt effective strategy on fertilizer use and cropping pattern. Â© 2021. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Performance of soil moisture sensors in gypsiferous and salt-affected soils
VL  - 209
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate soil moisture measurements are key for optimising field irrigation and for the precise monitoring of water flow in soil profiles or large watersheds. In recent decades, various soil moisture sensors (SMSs) have been widely used, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the SMS technologies under different soil and field conditions. The soluble salt content in soil can affect the sensitivity of SMSs because of their influence on soil permittivity. In this field study, we evaluated different types of SMSs in gypsiferous and salt-affected soils located at two agricultural sites in western Iraq. Two WaterScout capacitance sensors, SM100 and SMEC300, were evaluated in addition to the Watermark granular matrix sensor. Soil moisture measurements by the gravimetric method were compared with SMS readings. Bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) ranged between 3.3â€“8.1 and 5.6â€“10.3 dS mâˆ’1 for sites 1 and 2 respectively, during the experiment. The results showed that site-specific calibration of the sensors significantly increased their accuracy. At Site 1, the RMSE values for the Watermark, SM100, and SMEC300 sensors changed from 3.48, 2.68, and 1.96 before calibration to 1.25, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. For site 2, the RMSE values changed from 3.78, 3.09, and 2.34, to 1.37, 1.03, and 0.95, respectively. After the site-specific calibration, the capacitance sensors were sufficiently accurate for scientific measurements. The granular matrix sensors should only be used for field irrigation management if a high-accuracy level is not required and only after site-specific calibration. Â© 2021 IAgrE

TI  - Comparing farmersâ€™ soil fertility knowledge systems and scientific assessment in {Upper} {Eastern} {Kenya
VL  - 396
SN  - NA
AB  - Few soil quality studies have attempted to examine the relationship between farmer soil fertility classification indices along scientific measurements, thus calling for closer examination of this association using innovative, comprehensive and systematic approaches. This study was conducted in the upper Eastern Kenya, to compare farmersâ€™ knowledge of soil quality and laboratory soil measurements that were undertaken in the same fields. Farmer-descriptive soil quality indicator (FD-SQI) was compared with two scientific indicators, including additive SQI (A-SQI) and Factor Analysis (FA-SQI). A total of 69 farm households were sampled and surveyed using a face to face questionnaire to collect socio-economic, agricultural and soil quality perception data. Farmers described fertile and infertile soils, using a set of 9 descriptive likert scale indicators. Further, farm fields were classified as high or low fertility based on the farmer's soil quality rating indicators. Soil samples were georeferenced and collected from 69 farms at surface depth (0â€“20 cm), after which they were subjected to laboratory analyses using standard methods. Means of key soil properties were compared using ANOVAs, LSD tests and contrasts for both fertile and infertile plots while soil indices derived from farmer soil fertility measures and laboratory soil measurements were regressed using linear models. Farmer-descriptive soil quality indicators scored significantly higher in fertile fields, compared to infertile fields. There was a positive significant relationship between FD-SQI and the two scientific indices. The relationship was stronger between FD-SQI and FA-SQI. The regression of FD-SQI against A-SQI was higher in fertile plots compared to low fertility plots in the study areas. The stronger correlation between FA-SQI and FD-SQI could be attributed to the objectivity of the latter due to elimination of redundancy and bias through statistical procedures and thus greater responsiveness. The A-SQI, on the other hand, is considered subjective due to reliance on literature review and researcher's point of view. The findings showed that there was a linkage between local and scientific soil fertility assessment paradigms. This implies that farmersâ€™ knowledge of soil quality constituted a consistent and logical classification of soil quality. Local soil knowledge should be developed in conjunction with scientific soil methodologies to benefit resource-poor small-holder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa regions. Â© 2021 The Author(s)

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Despite decades of research confirming the benefits, most farms do not incorporate soil moisture sensing into their irrigation practices. Soil moisture sensing can be broken into two broad approaches, both of which have drawbacks. In situ sensors are installed in the ground, tend to be difficult to deploy and maintain, and have high costs. Remote-sensing based approaches use radars to infer soil moisture from surface reflection properties. While completely wireless, remote sensing suffers from lower resolution and accuracy compared to in situ sensing. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both. This paper introduces the idea of using inexpensive in situ backscatter tags with above-ground radars, which enables completely wireless soil moisture measurements with high-accuracy and high-resolution. Our key idea is introducing a simple, power efficient modulation scheme that enables commodity radars to easily detect and range the underground tag. We have benchmarked our approach against oven-based, industry-standard ground-truth measurements and demonstrated that, at a realistic depth and across several types of soil, we achieve a 90th percentile error of 3.4\%, which is the same accuracy as state-of-the-art in situ sensors. We also demonstrate that our approach works with similar accuracy at a real farm. Â© 2021 ACM.

TI  - Study of downscaling method for coarse-resolution soil moisture product using combined {AIRSAR} and {PALS} {Radiometer} data
VL  - 783
SN  - NA
AB  - As an important component of soil, soil moisture plays an important role in material and energy transmission between hydrosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. It is of great significance to accurately understand the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in large areas. At present, the spaceborne passive microwave remote sensing could achieve the accurate surface soil moisture of large areas, but at the low spatial resolution (10-50km). Therefore, its application was restricted. In this paper, a downscaling algorithm of passive microwave soil moisture products based on C-band backscattering coefficient is developed, and the algorithm is verified by L-band PALS Radiometer data and C-band AIRSAR data, the correlation coefficient R between the soil moisture content and the measured value is 0.71, and the root mean square error is 0.053cm3 â€¢ cm-3. According to the verification results of measured data, the downscaling algorithm of soil moisture retrieval products based on C-band backscattering coefficient is reliable.

TI  - Possibilities of remote sensing monitoring of soil fertility indicators of arable soils
VL  - 862
SN  - NA
AB  - On the example of the test field located in the Tula region (Russia), the possibility of using remote sensing data for mapping the fertility of arable soils is considered. Analysis of ground-based spectrometry data showed that the correlation between the spectral reflectance of the surface of arable soils and fertility indicators increases with an increase in wavelength. The maximum value of the correlation coefficient for mobile phosphorus was 0.84, for humus content - -0.83, for mobile potassium - -0.7, for pH - -0.86, for exchangeable calcium - -0.88, for exchangeable magnesium - 0.67. When analysing the Sentinel-2 satellite data, the correlation coefficients turned out to be higher than in the case of ground-based spectrometry data. Band 5 of Sentinel-2 was found to be the most informative for the detection of most of the analysed parameters of soil fertility. Depending on the property, the R2cv of the models varied from 0.47 to 0.93. The best models were obtained for pH, humus, mobile phosphorus, and exchangeable calcium. Based on regression models, maps of fertility indicators of arable soils for the test field were produced. The obtained models can be used to organize operational monitoring of the main parameters of soil fertility in the field. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Validation of {SMAP} {L2} passive-only soil moisture products using upscaled in situ measurements collected in {Twente}, the {Netherlands
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - The Twente region in the east of the Netherlands has a network with 20 soil monitoring stations that has been utilized for validation of the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) passive-only soil moisture products. Over the period from April 2015 until December 2018, seven stations covered by the SMAP reference pixels have fairly complete data records. Spatially distributed soil moisture simulations with the Dutch National Hydrological Model have been utilized for the development of upscaling functions to translate the spatial mean of point measurements to the domain of the SMAP reference pixels. The native and upscaled spatial soil moisture means computed using the in situ measurements have been adopted as references to assess the performance of the SMAP (i) Single Channel Algorithm at Horizontal Polarization (SCA-H), (ii) Single Channel Algorithm at Vertical Polarization (SCA-V), and (iii) Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA) soil moisture estimates. In the case of the Twente network it was found that the SCA-V SMAP soil moisture observations collected in the afternoon had the best agreement with the native spatial mean, leading to an unbiased root mean squared error (uRMSE) of 0.059m3 m-3, whereas for the upscaled in situ references primarily larger biases were found. These error levels are larger than the mission's target accuracy of 0.04m3 m-3, which can be attributed to large over- and under-estimation errors ({\textgreater}0:08m3 m-3), in particular at the end of dry spells and during freezing, respectively. The strong vertical dielectric gradients associated with rapid soil freezing and wetting cause the disparity in soil depth characterized by SMAP and in situ that leads to the large mismatches. Once filtered for frozen conditions and antecedent rainfall, the uRMSE improves to 0.043m3 m-3. Â© Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Analysis of heat paths in dual-probe-heat-pulse soil-moisture sensors for improved performance
VL  - 318
SN  - NA
AB  - We analyse heat paths of a packaged Dual-Probe-Heat-Pulse (DPHP) soil-moisture sensor to improve the sensor's performance at higher levels of volumetric water content. A DPHP sensor consists of heater and temperature probes protruding out into the soil from a casing. The two probes help estimate the soil moisture content by assessing the heat conduction through the soil in the intervening space between them. At lower soil-moisture conditions, the heat conduction through soil dominates whereas at higher soil-moisture contents heat flow through soil decreases due to the increase in volumetric heat capacity and specific heat. Inappropriate placement of the heater element could lead to erroneous measurement due to the heat conduction to the temperature probe through the casing material and the epoxy adhesive inside the casing. To study the heat flow in DPHP sensors, and to develop an improved design, thermal paths in the DPHP sensors having different heater element positions were first analysed through Finite Element Analysis. A Lumped Element Model was also developed to further examine the heat paths in the DPHP sensor and suggest design modifications. The trend exhibited by the lumped model corroborates the results of Finite Element Analysis. Laboratory experiments were performed with DPHP sensors having different heater element positions, results of which validated the modeling outcomes. The insights gained in this study would serve as the design guidelines for manufacturing DPHP soil-moisture sensors with improved accuracy at minimal power consumption. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Coconut-gliricidia mixed cropping systems improve soil nutrients in dry and wet regions of {Sri} {Lanka
VL  - 95
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry systems are alternative solutions for production and management of agricultural systems which may improve soil quality. In this study, we evaluated the potential of coconut Cocos nucifera-based Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) systems to improve soil quality of coconut lands in Sri Lanka in dry and wet regions. A three-year field experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three treatments T0, T5 and T20, being respectively the control, five and twenty years aged Gliricidia intercropped coconut-based mixed systems. Three replicates of soil samples were taken at 0â€“15, 15â€“30 and 30â€“45 cm and differences in soil physical and chemical properties were evaluated among treatments and sites. We found significant effects of mixed system treatments on the soil chemical properties. In particular, organic matter, soil exchangeable potassium, total nitrogen and available phosphorus contents showed higher values in most coconut-gliricidia mixed systemsâ€™ soils, with highest values obtained for T20. Cumulatively for all soil depths, organic matter content (22\%) and available phosphorus content (20\%) were higher on the wet site, and total exchangeable potassium content (69\%) higher on the dry site for T20. The pH, bulk density, microbial respiration and electric conductivity did not vary among treatments, but were influenced by the site characteristics, with the dry site showing higher values for pH and the wet site showing higher values for bulk density (5\%), microbial respiration (33\%) and electric conductivity (2\%) in T20 treatment. The study demonstrates that the systems with Gliricidia differed in their soil chemical attributes and had higher levels of soil nutrients when compared to coconut monocrop even at early ages, underlying the potential of Gliricidia for the rehabilitation of coconut growing soils.

AB  - In this work, we authors report the investigation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) modified poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS): titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocomposite sensors towards relative humidity and soil moisture measurements at room temperature for agricultural applications. The morphological and structural features of the nanocomposite films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and theromogravimetric analysis (TGA). These characterizations reveal the successful formation of nanocomposite structures with improved thermal stability. The conductivity of nanocomposite film shows significant improvement compared to pure PEDOT-PSS by three orders of magnitude. Sensitive layer of PEDOT-PSS:PVA doped TiO2 thin films were fabricated on ITO substrate using the spin coating technique to study relative humidity and soil moisture response. The nanocomposite film was subjected to varying levels of relative humidity (\%RH) ranging from 5 to 95\% and varied moisture content in soils of Montmorillonite and Kaolinite at room temperature. The resistance was found to decrease with increasing RH and gravimetric moisture content in Montmorillonite and Kaolinite soils. The humidity sensing response of PEDOT-PSS: PVA doped TiO2 (8 wt\%) composite thin film shows higher sensitivity of 96\% with fast response and recovery times of 10 and 50 s respectively. Further, the sensitivities of 10.5 and 8.32 kÎ© with 0.2\% variation in gravimetric water content were achieved upon exposure of the prepared sensor to red and black soils respectively. Due to being relatively inexpensive, simple fabrication technique, excellent sensitivity, good repeatability and reproducibility these PVA modified PEDOT-PSS: TiO2 nanocomposites sensors could be potentially useful in quantification of soil moisture content and relative humidity for agricultural applications.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of {Fengyun}-3 satellites derived soil moisture with in-situ measurements across the globe
VL  - 594
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a pivotal role in terrestrial water circulation, energy transfer, and mass exchange. The X-band radiometer on-board Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites have been used for soil moisture retrieval since 2011. In this study, the spatial and temporal integrity of all available Fengyun-3 series soil moisture products were evaluated, and the data accuracy was validated against four in-situ measurements ascertained globally. The validation results reveal that: (1) The ascending Fengyun-3B soil moisture retrievals express higher spatial coverage percentages than others, and a higher temporal coverage percentage appears at 20â€“60 Â°N and 20â€“50 Â°S in summer. (2) The soil moisture products derived from both Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites reveal superior goodness of fit and smaller bias in the northern hemisphere in-situ measurements than in the southern hemisphere. In particular, the satellite retrieved pixel scale soil moisture datasets possesses a better correlation to small scale networks with densely distributed stations. In the southern hemisphere, the bias was positively correlated with the vegetation index and negatively correlated to land surface temperature, and this regularity may act as a reference for Fengyun-3 soil moisture correction. Moreover, the Fengyun-3 soil moisture products reveal positive responses to precipitation, and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days. (3) The X-band signals were gradually impacted by increasing vegetation optical depth, leading to obvious overestimations. Further corrections, including hardware and software, are urgently required to enhance the anti-interference and robustness of the X-band signal. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 666
SN  - NA
AB  - The article considers the issues of soil fertility forecasting monitoring and substantiates the methods applied to the agricultural landscape of the Kuban river Delta on the example of assessing the initial state of arable land fertility. There was conducted the analysis of the properties of the Delta geosystems: Openness, integrity, functioning, dynamics, evolution and structure of the geosystem. Environmental factors are indicated when considering the Delta geosystems. The dependence of the surface radiation balance on the terrain features is considered on the example of the Kuban river Delta. The need for a comprehensive assessment of agro-resource potential is justified due to the development of degradation processes in the soil. The criteria for long-term forecasting as a single integrated approach to the methodology of assessing agricultural resource potential are substantiated. An integral indicator of soil fertility was used to assess fertility. The specific natural-technogenic complexes of separate parts of the Delta geosystems in relation to the Kuban river are identified. The impact of human anthropogenic activity has led to a noticeable decrease in soil fertility, reduced reserves of biomass, humus and basic nutrients in the soil, a single comprehensive monitoring of the assessment of agro-resource potential of its availability and use is necessary as a result of the development of degradation processes. Assessment of land resources to determine the trend of soil formation processes and soil fertility dynamics of a specific territory is very relevant. It is necessary to justify the identification of the main factors that affect the process of changing soil fertility, biomass, humus and basic nutrients.

VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility decline continues to be a major challenge limiting agricultural productivity globally. Despite the novelty of organic-based technologies in enhancing agricultural production in Kenya's central highlands, adoption is low. Therefore, we carried out a cross-sectional household survey of 300 randomly selected smallholder farmers to determine the specific organic-based practices by farmers; and the socioeconomic factors that influence the adoption intensity of selected organic-based technologies. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data and the Tobit regression model to evaluate the socioeconomic determinants of adoption intensity of selected organic-based technologies. We identified nine organic-based technologies that had different adoption rates among the farmers. The majority of the farmers had adopted manure (97\%) and manure combined with fertilizer (92\%) in Murang'a and Tharaka-Nithi, respectively. Manure was applied to the largest land in Murang'a with 31\% of the cultivated land. In comparison, manure combined with fertilizer had the highest adoption intensity in Tharaka-Nithi applied to about 25\% of the cultivated land. Gender, age of the household head, level of education, household size, access to external labor, training, Tropical Livestock Unit, agriculture group membership, access to credit, land cultivated, and farming experience influenced the adoption intensity of organic-based technologies among smallholder farmers. Based on the smallholder farmers' adoption behavior, this study can be used to disaggregate the farming households better in order to tailor specific organic-based soil fertility technologies solutions that meet their unique needs. One group would be those households that face specific constraints, as reflected in their low adoption rates, women-headed households and older farmers, and thus require more targeted / intensive efforts to overcome these barriers. The other group would be those households that require less focus because, when confronted with the technologies, they are more likely to adopt them easily, for example, the male-headed households. Hence, the smallholder farmers' adoption behavior, can enable policymakers to form a base for designing appropriate policies that encourage the adoption of organic-based soil fertility technology by smallholder farmers.

AB  - In hyper-arid areas, soil moisture controls surface dust emissivity, surface run-offs during flash floods, aquifers recharge, and soil induration, as well as the biological diversity of these extreme environments. Of particular interest is assessing the soil moisture spatial distribution after a rare rainstorm event in fractured karstic environments. Therefore, we use three different remote sensing methods to map the soil moisture change as well as the volumetric water content following a storm event in the hyper-arid, unvegetated, and karstic Qatar Peninsula: (1) C-band SENTINEL1 SAR backscatter intensity difference as well as its interferometric coherence, (2) Principal Component Analysis SENTINEL2-multispectral moisture index, and (3) L-band SMAP Level3 radiometer. Our results suggest that transient soil moisture spatial patterns with volumetric water content higher than 0.12 cm3/cm3 can persist longer than 48 hours following a major storm event with 50-100 mm precipitation in depressions. The above is a crucial step for assessing the origins and temporal evolution of soil moisture in Hyper-arid areas. Â© 2021 IEEE

SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical factor influencing hydrologic cycle and evapotranspiration. Antecedent soil moisture is also an important index for the early warning of slope disaster. However, the availability of observed data is limited due to few monitoring stations for soil moisture in Taiwan. In view of the situation, estimating soil moisture through remote sensing data may be a practical way to obtain a wide range of soil moisture information. In this study, remote sensing data from MODIS was collected, and the Surface Energy Balance Alogrithm for Land (SEBAL) was applied for evaporative fraction calculation. The results are compared with the soil moisture observations from seven debris flow monitoring stations, which are established by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau of Taiwan. The evaporative fraction is shown to positively correlate with soil moisture to some extent for the seven monitoring stations. Â© 2021. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Benefits of circular agriculture for cropping systems and soil fertility in oases
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Circular agriculture is an effective approach for the management of soil organic inputs that improves soil fertility and cropping system sustainability. We developed a cropping system typology and assessed effects of crop rotation, organic fertilization, and crop residue management on soil fertility properties. Farmers in DrÃ¢a-Tafilalet oases in Morocco were surveyed, and soil was sampled and analyzed. In the most common cropping systems (Type I), date palms were associated with cereals, forages, and perennial crops. Type II cropping systems referred to a monocropped date palm of only one cultivar. In Type III, date palm was associated with other crops on part of the utilized agricultural area and monocropped on the other part. In all cropping systems, mean soil organic matter (SOM) content was less than 1.5\% and the SOM:clay ratio was less than 12\%, which increased the soil degradation risk. Livestock was combined with crops in Type I and III cropping systems and produced 19.4 and 24.2 t of manure per farm per year, respectively. Type I and II cropping systems produced annually 0.98 and 2.1 t.haâˆ’1 of dry palms, respectively. Recycling these organic waste products remains a promising option that could produce organic inputs and offset the current lack of manure. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Agricultural soil moisture sensor based on {U}-bend {Plastic} {Optical} {Fibre} ({POF
VL  - 733
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture has an essential role in agriculture. The growth of specific vegetation requires a certain level of soil moisture. Therefore, monitoring soil moisture is very important for farmers. In monitoring, the first essential component is the sensor. Nevertheless, the existing proper soil moisture sensor is an electric-based system sensor with low water resistance. It easily damaged in extreme environments which can reduce sensor ability. Based on these problems, we developed a soil moisture sensor based on plastic optical fibre with a U-bend structure. Optical fibre was developed as an alternative sensor due to low prices, immunity to water, and resistance to extreme conditions. U-bend optical fibre can measure soil moisture depends on changes in the refractive index. The changes of refractive index caused by changes in external force which causes a decrease in the optical fibre output power are following the concentration of water contained in the soil. Plastic material is used because of its high durability and high responsiveness in refractive index-based measurements. In this experiment, a plastic optical fibre with a U-bend radius of 30 mm and a wavelength of 930 nm is used. The result shows that the U-Bend structure plastic optical fibre sensor is highly potential to use as a soil moisture sensor with sensor sensitivity of 2.885x10 W/\%VWC, R of 97.14\%, and standard deviation of 0.6\%.

TI  - Tillage system and integrated soil fertility inputs improve smallholder farmersâ€™ soil fertility and maize productivity in the {Central} {Highlands} of {Kenya
VL  - 112
SN  - NA
AB  - We designed and implemented an on-farm trial in Meru South and Gatanga sub-counties to understand the effects of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies on soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and maize productivity. The technologies included combinations of mineral fertiliser and maize stover (CrMf); crop residue, Tithonia diversifolia and rock phosphate (CrTiP); crop residue, Tithonia diversifolia and goat manure (CrTiMan); crop residue, inorganic fertiliser and goat manure (CrMfMan); crop residue, goat manure and Dolichos lablab (CrManLeg), and sole inorganic fertiliser (Mf) executed under conventional (ConC) and minimum (MinTill) tillage methods. We interviewed the farmers who participated in implementing the trials at the end of the study to understand the likelihood to uptake the technologies. We observed that the technologies increased soil N, P, K, and maize productivity compared to ConC (the control). There was a high likelihood of uptake of high-performing ISFM technologies. We recommend CrTiP for the two sub-counties for the short-term. However, a long-term experiment is needed to evaluate performances of CrTiMan, CrTiP, CrMfMan, and CrManLeg under the two tillage methods for site-specific recommendations taking into consideration rainfall variations.

TI  - Agro-ecology, resource endowment and indigenous knowledge interactions modulate soil fertility in mixed farming systems in {Central} and {Western} {Ethiopia
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Site-specific soil fertility management requires a fundamental understanding of factors that modulate soil fertility variability in the local context. To verify this assumption, this study hypothesized that soil fertility variability across two regions in Central and Western Ethiopia is determined by inter-related effects of agro-ecological zones and farmersâ€™ resource endowment (â€˜wealthyâ€™ versus â€˜poorâ€™ farmers). Mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled to partial least squares regression (midDRIFTS-PLSR) and wet-laboratory analyses were used to assess the soil fertility (soil pH, total soil carbon [TC] and nitrogen [TN], plant-available phosphorous [Pav] and potassium [Kav]) across four agro-ecological zones: â€˜High-Degaâ€™ (HD), â€˜Degaâ€™ (D), â€˜Weina-Degaâ€™ (WD) and â€˜Kolaâ€™ (K). MidDRIFTS peak area analysis of spectral frequencies (2,930 [aliphatic C-H], 1,620 [aromatic C = C], 1,159 [C-O poly-alcoholic and ether groups] cm-1) was applied to characterize soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and to calculate the SOC stability index (1,620:2,930). Higher TC in HD, as well as higher TN and Kav contents in K were found in fields of wealthy compared with poor farmers. Resource endowment dependent soil fertility management options revealed SOC of higher quality in wealthy compared with poor farms in D. Agro-ecological zones distinctions contributed to these soil fertility differences. Farmers distinguished visually fertile and less fertile fields based on soil colour. Higher pH in K and WD as well as Pav in K and HD were found in fertile (brown/black) than less fertile (red) soils. To conclude, tailor-made soil fertility management in the local context must consider agro-ecological zones and resource endowment interactions along with farmersâ€™ indigenous knowledge.

TI  - Comprehensive assessments of soil fertility and environmental quality in plastic greenhouse production systems
VL  - 385
SN  - NA
AB  - The increasing demand of fruits and vegetables has resulted in the rapid growth of plastic greenhouse production (PGP) systems worldwide. A comprehensive assessment method considering both soil fertility and environmental safety is necessary for the sustainable development of PGP systems. A total of 92 vegetable greenhouses in Jingyang County and 28 fruit greenhouses in Dali County in Shaanxi Province, China, were selected for comparing the changes of soil quality under two cultivation patterns. The soil comprehensive quality index (SQI) in Jingyang (0.53) was significantly higher than that in Dali (0.46) (p {\textless} 0.05). A significant correlation was found between the SQI and the soil fertility index (SFI) (p {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that the SQI was mainly dependent on the soil fertility level in greenhouses. The primary limiting factors of the SFI in PGP in Jingyang and Dali were low soil organic matter content (19.57 g kgâˆ’1) and high electrical conductivity (1303 Î¼S cmâˆ’1), respectively, indicating that soil in greenhouses in Jingyang and Dali might experience nutrient deficiencies and soil salinity accumulation problems, respectively. Cd and Hg were main limiting factors of soil environmental index (SEI), especially Hg. The SEI in Dali (0.74) was significantly lower than that in Jingyang (0.81) due to differences in the geo-accumulation indexes of heavy metals in the topsoil in greenhouses. Considering that no significant difference was found in the SFI between two study areas, the SEI is likely responsible for the regional differences in the SQI in PGP. The negative correlation of the SEI with the cultivation ages of plasticulture indicated that heavy metal accumulation problems would be the primary limiting factor of the SQI in the future if greenhouses cannot be managed appropriately. Our study provides data support for soil quality management in PGP systems. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessing the effects of harvesting with and without burning and vinasse application in sugarcane crops: {Evaluation} of soil fertility and phosphorus pools in different ethanol production systems
VL  - 307
SN  - NA
AB  - Ethanol is recognized worldwide as a clean and renewable energy source. In tropical and subtropical countries, it is produced from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). In this study, we investigated the effects of sugarcane management systems: a) burning of sugarcane for harvest for 37 years (SCB37); b) burning of sugarcane for 3 years after 5 years of fallow (SCB3); c) sugarcane field without burning for harvest for 3 years (SCWB), and d) burning for harvest with the application of vinasse for 3 years (SCV), on soil fertility and accumulation of organic and inorganic fractions of phosphorus (P) in sugarcane crops for bioenergy production in south-east Brazil. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0â€“5, 5â€“10, 10â€“20, and 20â€“40 cm between planting rows in each management system and submitted for evaluation of soil fertility and accumulation of P fractions via sequential fractionation. We observed that application of vinasse reduced the pH (3.7â€“4.2) and the availability of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ on the surface, associated with the increase in Al3+ content and potential acidity. However, its use increased the availability of K+ and inorganic P content of higher lability (extracted with NaHCO3) in the subsurface. The maintenance of straw on the surface promoted reductions in pH values and an increase in the potential acidity and was inefficient in the accumulation of organic and inorganic fractions of P, compared to the system with the application of vinasse. Overall, we observed that the moderately labile fraction (organic and inorganic) represented on average 60 \% (higher participation) of the total P content of soil in the experimental areas and was more significant in the soil under vinasse application and less evident in the treatments without burning and in the 3-year burning. This fraction can represent an important reserve of P (legacy) for the crops, reducing the use of phosphate mineral fertilizers over the years. Our findings are important for the selection and implementation of efficient and sustainable sugarcane cultivation systems, with implications for the ethanol industry to meet the growing demand for renewable fuel in the world.

TI  - Diversification of maize-based intercropping systems in tropical rainforest agroecosystem of {Nigeria}: {Productivity}, profitability and soil fertility
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Africa are in dire need of resilient maize-based cropping systems that can guarantee food, nutrition, and income security in the face of increasing armyworm infestations, erratic rainfall and drought occurrences. Thus, this study aims to identify adaptive maize-based systems with high productivity, increased profitability, and enhanced soil fertility for the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. We evaluated four maize-based systems, comprising of sole maize; maize/cowpea intercrop; maize/groundnut intercrop; and maize/sweet potato intercrop for higher productivity, profitability, and soil fertility. Results showed that the system productivity of maize/sweet potato intercrop (4.2 t haâ€“1) was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than those of maize sole (2.6 t haâ€“1); maize/cowpea (3.5 t haâ€“1); and maize/groundnut (3.0 t haâ€“1). Also, maize/sweet potato ( 1081 haâ€“1) significantly increased the net income in terms of monetary profits compared to those of maize sole ( 557 haâ€“1); maize/cowpea ( 882 haâ€“1); and maize/groundnut ( 699 haâ€“1). However, the net benefit-cost ratio of maize/sweet potato (2.47) and maize/cowpea (2.35) was similar. The effect of cowpea, when intercropped with maize, significantly increased the total nitrogen (N) content and available phosphorus (P) in soil by about 22\% and 6-12\%, respectively, compared to those of maize sole, and maize/sweet potato and maize/groundnut. Here, we conclude that the intercropping of maize with sweet potato and/or cowpea in this agroecosystem is an adaptive and resilient system, which is capable of meeting the food, nutrition, and income stability of farmers while maintaining the soil health. Crop diversification through intercropping can contribute to agroecological balance and maintenance of the soil ecosystem services. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Modeling of effective soil fertility using remote sensing methods of agrocenoses
VL  - 677
SN  - NA
AB  - The presence of statistical relationships between productivity and soil properties allows one to assess soil fertility on a mathematical and statistical basis. To do this, it is necessary to substantiate a set of estimated soil properties and mathematically describe their cumulative effect on the yield. Known traditional methods of establishing relationships between soil properties and yield are time-consuming and expensive. It is practically impossible to cover large cultivated areas with these studies. Such work can be effectively performed using the means and methods of remote sensing, using imagery from satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, which are equipped with multispectral cameras. Modern technologies provide the ability to survey a large area of the territory, uniform rules for recording the spectral characteristics of vegetation, determining the associated vegetation indices.

TI  - Integrating hyperspectral imaging with machine learning techniques for the high-resolution mapping of soil nitrogen fractions in soil profiles
VL  - 754
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) plays a central role in soil quality and biogeochemical cycles. However, little is known about the distribution and spatial variability of the different fractions of soil N within entire soil profiles. This study aimed to investigate the potential of laboratory-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) spectroscopy to retrieve and map total N (TN), available N (AvailN), ammonium N (NH4-N), nitrate N (NO3-N), and microbial biomass N (MBN) in soil profiles at a high resolution. HSI images of eleven intact soil profiles of 100 Â± 5 cm depth from three typical soil types were recorded. A variety of nonlinear machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), cubist regression tree (Cubist), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine regression (SVMR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were compared with a partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine the most suitable model for the prediction of the various soil N fractions. Overall, the results showed that nonlinear techniques performed better than PLSR in most cases, with a high coefficient of determination (R2) and low root mean square error (RMSE). Among the models, SVMR was found to be superior to the other tested models for TN (R2P = 0.94, RMSEP = 0.17 g kgâˆ’1), AvailN (R2P = 0.94, RMSEP = 13.35 mg kgâˆ’1), NO3-N (R2P = 0.82, RMSEP = 7.31 mg kgâˆ’1), and NH4-N (R2P = 0.70, RMSEP = 1.51 mg kgâˆ’1) based on independent validation, whereas MBN (R2P = 0.63, RMSEP = 6.62 mg kgâˆ’1) was predicted best by KNN. In addition, SVMR required less computational time and was less sensitive to spectral noise. It can therefore be concluded that HSI spectroscopy combined with SVMR is suitable for the high-resolution mapping of various soil N fractions in soil profiles. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 2021-May
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays a key role in land-atmosphere interactions and is an important variable in hydrological modeling. Satellite-based microwave sensors have been demonstrated for estimating surface soil moisture, but the spatial resolution is poor. Retrieval of soil moisture over inhomogeneous terrain is difficult. There is a need for fine-resolution soil moisture data to support both scientific modeling research and operational applications.The Remote Sensing Center at the University of Alabama has developed a compact, ultra-wideband microwave radar operating over the frequency range of 2-6 GHz for airborne soil moisture measurements. A highly linear, highly configurable chirp is generated by a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) driven voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with phase-locked loop (PLL). This system enables us to generate an ultra-linear chirp of up to 10 GHz bandwidth. We have also developed a custom ultrawideband antenna to collect data over incidence angles between 0 and 50 degrees with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio and meet the bandwidth requirements. The radar performance is verified using simulated targets in the laboratory, and the measured impulse response is close to the ideal response.We have integrated the radar with a hybrid multirotor unmanned aircraft system (UAS) that can be operated within FAA limits. The long endurance and low-speed capability of the hybrid multirotor aircraft minimizes motion-related errors. We have operated the radar and collected data at test sites near Tuscaloosa, AL. Radar measurements are being calibrated and validated against detailed in-situ measurements collected using soil moisture probes. In this paper, we will discuss the design and development of the radar, measurements, and field results. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Agriculture environment monitoring: {Rapid} soil fertility evaluation by means of near infrared spectroscopy
VL  - 644
SN  - NA
AB  - In agricultural practices, the development of environmental controlling programs is essential in maintaining soil fertility. It should be monitored constantly in real time situation by predicting soil properties such as nutrients and mineral contents. The main purpose of this presented paper is employ the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique in determining nitrogen (N) and magnesium (Mg) content of agricultural soil rapidly and simultaneously. Near infrared spectra data of soil samples were obtained by acquiring absorbance data in wavelength range from 1000 to 2500 nm using a portable sensing device NIR with a photodiode array detector. Spectra data were enhanced using mean normalization approach to improve prediction accuracy. Further, prediction models were developed by means of partial least square regression (PLSR) followed by cross validation. The results showed that both soil fertility properties (N and Mg) can be predicted by NIRS with maximum correlation coefficient (r) were 0.93 and 0.91 for N and Mg respectively. It may conclude that NIRS technique was able to be used in agriculture environment monitoring especialy to predict soil fertility properties. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Market access and resource endowment define the soil fertility status of smallholder farming systems of {South}-{Kivu}, {DR} {Congo
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - This study verified the inter-related effect of â€˜market distanceâ€™, defined as walking time, â€˜farm typologyâ€™, defined as resource endowment, and â€˜siteâ€™, defined as geographic location with contrasting agro-ecologies, as well as farmersâ€™ indigenous knowledge on soil fertility variability in smallholder farming systems in two distinct regions (Bushumba, Mushinga) of South-Kivu, DR Congo. A total of 384 soil samples were selected from representative farmersâ€™ fields and analysed for soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and quality, as well as nutrient contents, using midDRIFTS (mid-infrared diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy) and wet chemistry analyses. MidDRIFTS was also used to calculate SOC stability indexes as SOC quality proxies. â€˜Market distanceâ€™ and â€˜farm typologyâ€™ were key determinants of soil fertility variability, both with contrasting trends in Bushumba and Mushinga. Decreasing soil fertility with increasing market distance was noted across all farm typologies. â€˜Farm typologyâ€™ was related to exchangeable calcium and magnesium, while â€˜siteâ€™ resulted in a difference of plant available phosphorus. SOC quality indexes were related to â€˜siteâ€™, interacting with â€˜market distanceâ€™. A â€˜market distanceâ€™ effect became obvious in the medium wealthy and poor farms of Mushinga, where a lower SOC quality in remote fields plots was noted with increasing market distance. In agreement with farmersâ€™ indigenous knowledge, soil fertility levels were higher in deep than shallow soils, which were reflected in higher nutrient stocks in deep soils receiving organic amendments. Our results inferred that soil fertility variability across smallholder farms must consider various inter-related determinants as basis for site-specific fertility management interventions.

TI  - Critical review on soil phosphorus migration and transformation under freezing-thawing cycles and typical regulatory measurements
VL  - 751
SN  - NA
AB  - Freezing-thawing period plays an important role in the soil nutrient cycling. The frequency of freezing-thawing cycles (FTCs) can directly affect the supply of effective soil nutrients, further influences the growth and development of crops. Phosphorus is one of the essential nutrients for crop growth, and almost no compounds in gas form in nature, which is non-renewable resources. In modern agricultural production, phosphorus required by plants is mainly from the soil, but the utilization rate of phosphorus fertilizer in soil is generally only 10\%â€“25\%. Therefore, it is of great significance to study phosphorus migration and transformation behavior of soil in the non-growth period and related interfacial processes for improving the utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer, increasing crop yield, reducing excessive application of phosphorus fertilizer, and subsiding environmental pollution. This paper systematically concludes key interfacial process of soil phosphorus in freezing-thawing soil system and relative mechanisms describing migration and transformation behavior of soil phosphorus. Besides, it summarizes the mediating effects of widely used soil conditioner on phosphorus cycling. The results show that freezing- thawing will destroy the structure of the soil, causing phosphorus to migrate along with runoff, soil water and heat movement. It also affects the types of microorganisms, the activity of microbial communities and the oxidation-reduction reaction of related minerals, making the phosphorus in soil from an unstable form to an active form. Biochar and humic substances can improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil, and have favorable effects on soil during freezing-thawing period. This review has important significance for the rational utilization of existing phosphorus resources, the maintenance of soil phosphorus cycle balance and the sustainable development of agriculture, meanwhile, has guiding significance for the reasonable utilization of agricultural wastes.

TI  - Comparison between observed and {DeNitrification}-{DeComposition} model-based nitrous oxide fluxes and maize yields under selected soil fertility management technologies in {Kenya
VL  - 463
SN  - NA
AB  - Aims: Process-based biogeochemical models can be used to simulate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and maize yields and draw insights on yields improvement and climate change mitigation options. We compared both observed and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) simulated soil N2O fluxes and maize yields. Methods: We used DNDC model to simulate soil N2O fluxes and maize yields under four soil fertility treatments (inorganic fertiliser, animal manure, animal manure + inorganic fertiliser and control,) replicated thrice for 1 year in Central Highlands of Kenya. We sampled soil N2O fluxes using static chambers installed in each plot. We analysed soil N2O using gas chromatography and calculated cumulative fluxes using trapezoidal rule linear interpolation between sampling dates. Results: DNDC showed poor results in simulating daily N2O fluxes (157.16\% â‰¤ normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) â‰¤ 324.01\% and 0.90 â‰¤ modelling efficiency (NSE) â‰¤ 0.96), good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative annual soil N2O fluxes (6.16 â‰¤ nRMSE â‰¤12.86 and 0.63 â‰¤ NSE â‰¤ 0.86) and good to excellent performance in simulating maize yields (1.15\% â‰¤ nRMSE â‰¤13.86\% and 0.51 â‰¤ NSE â‰¤ 0.88) across all soil fertility treatments. Conclusion: The DNDC model had good to excellent performance in simulating cumulative soil N2O fluxes and crop yields across treatments. Though the model captured yield-scaled N2O fluxes and N2O emission factors across treatments, they were underestimated under manure treatment. There is a need to continue calibrating the DNDC model for improved capture of daily N2O fluxes and uptakes on Kenyan soils.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents a prototype design and construction of the smart multi-level soil moisture sensing system. The system consists of 3 3-level soil moisture probes whose length of each is adjustable. The soil moisture probe is equipped with the microcontroller unit, the solar panel, and the long range (LoRa) communication module. The capacitive sensing technique is chosen due to its satisfying accuracy, low cost, and low complexity. Each probe measures the response frequency due to capacitance variation associated with the soil moisture. The response frequency is then transmitted wirelessly over the long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) to the network server. The mathematical model of the actual moisture content (MC) vs measured response frequency was developed. The model was optimized to achieve the optimal correlation R-square of 0.8996. The measured moisture contents are validated by the actual ones. It is found that the average error is only Â±2.87\%MC. The web application is finally developed to display soil moisture contents.

TI  - Soil moisture index estimation from {Landsat} 8 images for prediction and monitoring landslide occurrences in {Ulu} {Kelang}, {Selangor}, {Malaysia
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the contributing factors that accelerates soil erosion and landslide events due to the increase in pore pressure which eventually reduces the soil strength. For landslide prediction and monitoring purposes, large-scale measurement involves estimating the soil moisture. However, estimation of soil moisture usually involves point-based measurements at a particular site and time, which is difficult to capture the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics. This paper presents the estimation of the SMI using Landsat 8 images for prediction and monitoring of landslide events in Ulu Kelang, Selangor. The selected SMI map for dry, moist, and wet seasons are obtained from climatology rainfall analysis over 20-year periods (1998-2017). SMI is assessed based on remote sensing data which are land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using GIS software. Overall results indicated that rainfall distribution is high during inter-monsoon (IM), followed by northeast monsoon (NEM) and southwest monsoon (SWM) season. High rainfall distribution is a direct contributor towards SMI condition. Results from simulation show that April 2017 is known to have the highest SMI estimation season and selected to be the best SMI mapping parameter to be applied for prediction and monitoring of landslide events.

TI  - Impacts of nitrogen practices on yield, grain quality, and nitrogen-use efficiency of crops and soil fertility in three paddy-upland cropping systems
VL  - 101
SN  - NA
AB  - BACKGROUND: Global food security faces a number of challenges due to increasing population, climate change, and urbanization, while excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers has become a major challenge for sustainable, intensive agriculture. Assessing the impact of agronomic management practices on seed yield, grain quality, and soil fertility is a critical step in understanding nutrientuse efficiency. RESULT: The comprehensive evaluation index had good fitness to that of single attribute (i.e. seed yield, crop quality and soil fertility), indicating that the comprehensive evaluation index was reliable. Applying controlled-release urea (rice in wheat and oilseed rape field: 150 kg N haâˆ’1, other crops: 120 kg N haâˆ’1) plus common urea (30 kg N haâˆ’1) incorporating straw from the previous season across the growing season for cereal and oilseed crops showed a slight improvement in seed productivity and Nuse efficiency among three cropping systems in the traditional evaluation method. Compared with local farm practice (applying common urea of 150 kg N haâˆ’1), applying these practices in combination based on the outcome of the comprehensive evaluation index method decreased the seed yield by âˆ’1.27 29.8\% but improved quality and soil fertility for the paddy-upland cropping system, respectively. CONCLUSION: Properly managing N application by applying partial and fully controlled release of urea with or without straw incorporation for a specific crop system has the potential to provide a better compromise among yield, grain quality, and soil fertility in southern China.

TI  - Comparative study on spatial digital mapping methods of soil nutrients based on different geospatial technologies
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) are important indicators of soil fertility when undertaking a quality evaluation. Obtaining a high-precision spatial distribution map of soil nutrients is of great significance for the differentiated management of nutrient resources and reducing non-point source pollution. How-ever, the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients lead to uncertainty in the modeling process. To deter-mine the best interpolation method, terrain, climate, and vegetation factors were used as auxiliary variables to participate in the investigation of soil nutrient spatial modeling in the present study. We used the mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and accuracy (Acc) of a dataset to comprehensively compare the performance of four different geospatial tech-niques: ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), and multiscale geographically weighted regression kriging (MGWRK). The results showed that the hybrid methods (RK, GWRK, and MGWRK) could improve the prediction accuracy to a certain extent when the residuals were spatially correlated; however, this improvement was not significant. The new MGWRK model has certain advantages in reducing the overall residual level, but it failed to achieve the desired accuracy. Considering the cost of modeling, the OK method still provides an interpolation method with a relatively simple analysis process and relatively reliable results. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to design soil sampling rationally and obtain higher-quality auxiliary variable data than to seek complex statistical methods to improve spatial prediction accuracy. This research provides a reference for the spatial mapping of soil nutrients at the farmland scale. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Agricultural service providers (Agric. SPs) play an essential role in the adoption of promising agricultural technologies by small and medium-sized farms. Similarly, agricultural service provision also generates substantial income for them. The study highlights the role of Agric. SPs in promotion of moisture conservation; soil health and fertility improving technologies at specific sites in Pakistan for three years i.e. from 2015 to 2017. It is based on primary data collected in the year 2018-19 from eighty sampled farmers, which were purposively selected to cover a range of selected technologies. It is found that Agric. SPs-induced adoption of these technologies has increased over time. They achieved considerable success in the promotion of the use of gypsum for moisture conservation and fertilizer placement drill in Pothwar-Punjab, ridge planting of crops in irrigated Punjab province, laser land leveling in irrigated areas of Sindh province, and use of biozote for improving soil fertility in both irrigated and rain-fed areas of Punjab province. These technologies have good income generation potential for Agric. SPs. The article also highlights factors hindering the large-scale adoption of the technologies in the country. Technical and entrepreneurship capacity building of the Agric. SPs in the provision of services to farmers in multiple technologies, and technical feasibility assessment of few technologies to use these for more than one crop are suggested for large-scale adoption of these technologies.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning parametric and non-parametric techniques for determining soil moisture: {Case} study at las palmas andean basin
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the most important variables to monitor in agriculture. Its analysis gives insights about strategies to utilize better a particular area regarding its use, i.e., pasture for cows (or similar), production forests, or even to answer what crops should be planted. The vertical structure of the soil moisture plays an important role in several physical processes such as vegetation growth, infiltration process, soil â€“ atmosphere interactions, among others. Despite a set of tools are currently being evaluated and used to monitor soil moisture, including satellite images and in-situ sensor, several drawbacks are still persisting. In situ data is expensive for high spatial monitoring and vertical measurements and satellite data have low spatial resolution and only retrieval information of soil moisture for the top few centimeters of the soil. The present work shows an experiment design for collecting soil moisture data in a specific Andean basin with in-situ sensors in different kinds of soils as a promising tool for reproducing soil moisture profiles in areas with scarce information, employing only surface soil moisture and simple soil characteristics. Collected data is used to train machine learning supervised parametric (Multiple Linear Regression - MLR) and non-parametric models (Artificial Neural Networks - ANNs and Support Vector Regression - SVR) for soil moisture estimation in different depths. Conclusions show that parametric methods do not meet goodness of fit assumptions; so, non-parametric methods must be considered, and SVR outperforms parametric methods regarding regression accuracy allowing to reproduce the soil moisture content profiles. The proposed SVR model represents a high potential tool to replicate the soil moisture profiles using only surface information from remote sensing or in-situ data. Â© 2021 ASTES Publishers.

TI  - Determination of soil nutrients ({NPK}) using optical methods: a mini review
VL  - 44
SN  - NA
AB  - In the present situation, plants have to meet the food supply demand for a large and increasing population. In order to get high yield, it is essential for the plantations to be nourished with soil containing an appropriate amount of nutrients like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Various methods such as, physical (optical) and chemical (electrochemistry) have been adopted to analyze the soil nutrients. This paper reviewed optical methods of soil nutrient detection suitable for building a portable sensor because it can sense nutrients in dry soil samples directly without the need for complicated sample pretreatments. We concentrate and elaborate on optical methods of experimentation. Starting from laboratory testing standards followed in India we move on to off the lab crude methods like soil testing kits and colorimetric approaches. Further, we review the effective and utilitarian spectroscopic approaches and also the technologically advanced and latest methods like imaging systems, microfluidic, and micro-electromechanical system (MEMs) based sensors. However, optical methods are affected by environmental factors that affect the accuracy of sensor results. This paper then discusses boons and curses of optical methods of soil nutrient sensing. It also explains briefly the working of each method and mentions the most recent advancements made in the given testing method. We hope that this paper can serve as a guide for the experimenters and give a direction for carrying out further work required in developing a portable and efficient soil NPK detection sensor.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The knowledge of soil moisture distribution is important for agriculture. In large areas many probes can be used to estimate soil moisture. However, in a very small areas using several moisture probes can be inconvenient and a good idea is to apply a single probe in order to avoid excess soil disturbance. For soil moisture distribution measurements, a three-rod time domain reflectometry probe was proposed. The presented probe has three switchable rods, each of which can work as a signal and the others as a ground. This solution enables measuring soil moisture gradient during a single insertion of the probe into the soil. The proposed approach was validated with the use of electromagnetic simulations.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key factor affecting crop growth, and accurate monitoring soil moisture is of great significance for agriculture. GNSS-IR is a low-cost remote sensing technology, using the interference of GNSS direct and reflected signals to obtain environmental parameters, which can realize non-contact, large-scale, real-time and continuous soil moisture monitoring. In this paper, a random forest algorithm is proposed to conduct soil moisture inversion using SNR frequency, amplitude, phase observables of GPS L1, L2 respectively, and the processing flow and soil moisture inversion model are presented. Taking the inversion results of PRN 4 as an example, the R2 of L1 single frequency parameter inversion result is improved by 0.56\% and 4.25\% compared with the inversion results of amplitude and phase, RMSE decreases by 6.49\% and 29.65\% respectively. The R2 of L2 single frequency parameter inversion result is improved by 5.76\% and 6.21\% compared with the inversion results of amplitude and band single parameter, and the RMSE is reduced by 29.55\% and 37.10\% respectively. The results show that the random forest algorithm used in frequency inversion is more effective than the amplitude and phase.

AB  - According to India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), 32\% of the global food market is dependent on Indian agricultural sector. Due to urbanisation, the fertile land have been utilised for non-agricultural purposes. The loss of agricultural lands impacts the productivity and results with diminishing yield. Soil is the most important factor for the thriving agriculture, since it contains the essential nutrients. The food production could be improved through the viable usage of soil nutrients. To identify the soil nutrients, the physical, chemical and biological parameters were examined using many machine learning algorithms. However, the environmental factors such as sunlight, temperature, humidity, and rainfall plays a major role in improving the soil nutrients since it is responsible for the process of photosynthesis, germination, and saturation. The objective is to determine the soil nutrient level by accessing the associative properties including the environmental variables. The proposed system termed as Agrarian application which recommends crops for the particular land using classification algorithms and predicts the yield rate by employing regression techniques. The application will help the farmers in selecting the crops based on the soil nutrient content, environmental factors and predicts the yield rate for the same.

AB  - Soil fertility is a very important parameter in agriculture. The yield of the produce depends heavily on fertility. Fertility of the soil is dependent on multiple parameters like the moisture, temperature, Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium (NPK) content of the soil, and pH value of the soil. These can be identified by sensors directly, but they have a very localized view of the field. Hyperspectral imaging can give us an overall view of the field. In this project, the relation between the hyperspectral images and the moisture and temperature of the soil is established and machine learning models like linear regression and random forests to predict the values are created. The hyperspectral images used for this project are from the satellite EO-1 Hyperion. Â© 2021 IEEE

TI  - Root-zone soil moisture from process-based and remote sensing features in {ANN
VL  - 11856
SN  - NA
AB  - Quantification of Root-Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) is crucial for agricultural applications. It impacts processes like vegetation transpiration and water percolation. The surface soil moisture (SSM) can be assessed through active and passive microwave remote sensing, but no current sensor enables direct retrieval of RZSM. Spatial maps of RZSM can be retrieved via proxy observations (vegetation stress, water storage change, surface soil moisture) or from land surface model predictions. Recently, more interest has risen in the use of data-driven methods to predict RZSM. In this study, we investigated the use of physical-process based features in the context of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We integrated the infiltration process information into an ANN model through the use of the recursive exponential filter. We also used a remote sensing-based evaporative efficiency as an input feature. It is important to note that these two processes depend on surface soil moisture which can be assessed through remote sensing. The impact of the use of geophysical variables was also assessed through the use of surface soil temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). At each step of the study, the ANN models were trained using either only in-situ surface soil moisture data provided by the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) or an additional geophysical or processbased feature. The results show that the use of more features in addition to SSM information improves the prediction accuracy in specific cases when compared to an ANN model that predicts RZSM based on only SSM. The ability of the developed models to predict RZSM over larger areas will be assessed in the future. Â© COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

VL  - 205
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop rotation, cover crops introduction and no tillage adoption have improved tropical agriculture sustainability through improvements on soil conservation and water use efficiency. Soil fertility and topsoil phosphorus (P) accumulation is also altered by management, affecting P dynamics and its use for subsequent cash crops. Changes in soil P fractions promoted by no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) in soybean/cotton crop systems with different cover crop rotations (fallow, maize as second crop, brachiaria and millet) were investigated in two long-term trials in Brazilian Oxisols (Ox-1 and Ox-2), and compared to soils under native Cerrado vegetation. Hedley's P fractionation was performed in soil samples taken from 0 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depth layers and P fractions grouped by their predicted lability. Long-term cultivation generated large amounts of legacy P in the soil (184âˆ’341 mg kgâˆ’1) but only a small portion remained in labile fractions (11â€“16 \%), with a slight increase in non-labile P ({\textless}5 \%) and organic P (10â€“20 \%) concentrations under NT when compared to CT. Although the soil P remained mostly in less available fractions, the legacy P obtained by the difference between the soil P data from the agricultural land and the native area provided a useful approach for P accumulation estimative over the time, very close to the predicted P inputs/outputs accounting. Brachiaria recycled more P than other cover crops, increasing the labile P (5â€“20 \%) and all the organic P fractions (10â€“25 \%) over the time. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 772 LNEE
SN  - NA
AB  - The global water cycle is affected by Soil moisture which plays an important role in the fields of hydrology and agriculture. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the theory and method of soil moisture detection. Currently, soil moisture detection methods are very rich. As an emerging remote sensing technology, satellite-borne GNSS-R has the advantages of abundant signal sources, low cost and Global coverage, etc. It has attracted people's attention to use satellite-borne GNSS-R technology to retrieve soil moisture. In this paper, a method of soil moisture retrieval based on satellite-borne GNSS-R is proposed. Soil moisture was constructed as a function of surface reflectivity, vegetation optical depth, roughness coefficient and temperature which are extracted from CYGNSS data and SMAP data. Then we use neural network model training data to determine the mathematical model of soil moisture retrieval. African soil moisture status was obtained using CYGNSS data from July to December 2018. Finally, the soil moisture retrieval method proposed in this paper was evaluated by comparing with the soil moisture data provided by SMAP. The results show that the soil moisture retrieval method proposed in this paper has a good consistency with SMAP soil moisture. This shows that GNSS reflection signals collected by CYGNSS project can be used to retrieve soil moisture and satellite-borne GNSS-R technology has great potential to obtain soil moisture with high precision and high spatial and temporal resolution. And it also provides a new method for soil moisture retrieval. Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Bistatic system for radar sensing of soil moisture
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - The article is devoted to the development of a method for determining the moisture content of the upper layers of agricultural lands on the basis of mathematical modeling of a radar signal reflected from the soil. For the radar study of the moisture content of agricultural lands, it is proposed to use remote sensing using relatively inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of a multi-rotor type (a bistatic system consisting of a radar transmitter and a radar receiver placed on two UAVs). At the same time, it is necessary to ensure a high probability of correct determination of soil moisture to a depth exceeding the groundwater level. In remote sensing, the reflection coefficient from the air-soil interface depends on the dielectric properties of the top soil layer and the polarization of the sounding signal. When modeling the reflected signal, it is advisable to represent the earth's surface as a flat-layered structure, the upper part of which will be represented by vegetation and heterogeneities followed by the area with a relatively constant dielectric constant value to the groundwater level and then the area with a linearly increasing conductivity. Studies have shown that the Brewster effect in soils manifests itself when the probe signal is perpendicularly polarized. When the soil surface is irradiated with a perpendicularly polarized radar signal at Brewster's angle, the required penetration depth of the probing signal is ensured, at which the reflected signal will contain enough information about the percentage of moisture in the upper soil layers. The information contained in changes in the amplitude and phase of the reflected radio signal is related to the structure and dielectric properties of the upper soil layers. On the basis of this information, rational agro-technical measures can be justified, both operational (watering, fertilization) and long-term (reclamation, drainage).

VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is the main source of water needed by plants, an important factor affecting agricultural operation measures and precision agriculture, and a necessary parameter in the research process of agriculture, environment and other disciplines. Therefore, accurate, simple and rapid measurement of soil water content is very important. In this paper, near infrared spectroscopy was used to realize the rapid detection of soil moisture. A total of 120 soil samples with different water contents were prepared, of which 113 were available samples. According to the reflectance spectral data of samples in 900-1700 nm band, the spectral data were preprocessed by different methods, including first derivative, second derivative, Savitzky-Golay ( S-G ) smoothing, Savitzky-Golay smoothing combined with first derivative, Savitzky-Golay smoothing combined with second derivative, standard normal variable transformation ( SNV ), multiplicative scatter correction ( MSC ), and then the partial least squares ( PLSR ) method was used to establish the relationship model between the spectral data and the measured water content. The results show that the partial least squares model with the best prediction effect on soil moisture content can be established by using S-G smoothing method to preprocess the spectral data.

TI  - Soil nutrient dynamics and plant-induced nutrient mobilisation in organic and low-input farming systems: conceptual framework and relevance
VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - Plant nutrition practice in organic agricultural systems is sometimes reduced to a renunciation of applying readily soluble mineral fertilisers. In organic farming, however, soil nutrient stocks are regarded as an additional source of plant-available nutrients that can be mobilised by crop plants through rhizosphere effects. Therefore, unlike in conventional farming, the focus is not on replacement of the nutrients removed by the harvested products through readily soluble fertilisers enhancing nutrient concentrations in the soil solution. Instead, it is on minimising nutrient losses and supplying plant nutrients through soil-plant-microorganism interactions in which improved soil structure and enhanced soil biological activity facilitate plant-induced nutrient mobilisation and nutrient uptake under conditions of limited nutrient availability in the soil. This paper reviews these soil processes that improve the availability of macro- and micronutrients to plant roots under conditions of limited nutrient availability. It focuses on providing a conceptual framework for the different processes contributing to nutrient mobilisation and within which the various strategies for improving nutrient efficiency can be integrated in organically managed soils. Essential farm management options based on scientific views of nutrient dynamics to maintain soil fertility are addressed. With diverse, legume-based crop rotations with an adequate proportion of time dedicated to fertility building crops, careful management of manure and organic residues, and by using permitted inputs for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), organic farms can be managed sustainably. However, efforts for recycling nutrients, mainly phosphorus, need to be enhanced. Â© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.

AB  - The soil nutrients nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) are primary and vital components for an agricultural land to be fertile. The excess or under usage of fertilizers will hamper the characteristics of the soil. The improper selection of manure would reduce the yield of the crop, resulting in loss of the yield. The proposed work aims at developing a sensor using the principle of optical transducer and hence determining NPK nutrients in the solution using Beerâ€“Lamberts law. Also, under or over irrigation would lead to loss of the crop. The proposed method also aims at providing irrigation monitoring using a soil moisture sensor which determines water content in the soil using principle of conductivity. The system is developed as a three-tier application having sensors as data acquisition layer. The wireless communication is using Bluetooth as data link/data communication layer. Finally, Android mobile application is the presentation layer. The work aims at providing best-suited fertilizer along with optimal amount of fertilizer that gives high yield. In comparison with existing methods in same domain, the proposed work is economical and time efficient. Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Spatial distribution of soil nutrients in farmland in a hilly region of the pearl river delta in {China} based on geostatistics and the inverse distance weighting method
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients are essential factors that reflect farmland quality. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential elements for plants, while silicon is considered a â€œquasi-essentialâ€ element. This study investigated the spatial distribution of plant nutrients in soil in a hilly region of the Pearl River Delta in China. A total of 201 soil samples were collected from farmland topsoil (0â€“20 cm) for the analysis of total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and available silicon (ASi). The coefficients of variation ranged from 47.88\% to 76.91\%. The NSRs of TN, AP, AK, and ASi were 0.15, 0. 07, 0.12, and 0.13, respectively. The NSRs varied from 0.02 to 0.20. All variables exhibited weak spatial dependence (R2 {\textless} 0.5), except for TN (R2 = 0.701). After comparing the prediction accuracy of the different methods, we used the inverse distance weighting method to analyze the spatial distribution of plant nutrients in soil. The uniform spatial distribution of AK, TN overall showed a trend of increasing from northeast to southwest, and the overall spatial distribution of AP and ASi showed that the northeast was higher than the southwest. This study provides support for the delimitation of basic farmland protection areas, the formulation of land use spatial planning, and the formulation of accurate farmland protection policies.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Most of the existing precision agriculture solutions recommend the use of fertilizers as a remedy to poor soil fertility and to boost yields. Such solutions cause environmental degradation in the long run mainly due to the overuse of fertilizers. There is therefore, a need for a system to ensure that farmers can practice precision farming in terms of a sustainable soil management approach so as to attain high yields while at the same time conserving the environment. In this research, a design and simulation of an embedded machine learning based system to predict the best crop to grow with minimal use of fertilizers with an aim of conserving the environment is presented. The system senses different real time soil parameters on a daily basis, integrates them with forecast weather information and uses embedded machine learning technique to determine which crop would grow best under the existing soil conditions so as to minimize fertilizer use. In addition to crop prediction, the system helps farmers to monitor the soil nutrients evolution so that action can be done on real time. The results are either displayed on the device or sent to the farmer's mobile phone. This is a move from the existing solutions that depend on cloud analytics and do not consider the change of soil conditions on time in making the predictions and decisions since this is expensive when done at the cloud. The implementation of the proposed solution is expected to not only lead to high productivity and reduced costs but also conserve the environment. Â© 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The great number of electromagnetic sensors for the measurement of soil moisture that differ in measurement methods, price, shape, measurement volume, durability, etc. that are available on the market make a potential user confused about the choice. They cannot compare the respective measurement equipment because there is no easy and reliable way to do that. Growing concern about sustainable use of water resources for agricultural, industrial and domestic use as well as increasing market of respective measurement tools put pressure on the proper choice. The paper presents some issues and efforts in the direction to standardize electromagnetic measurements of soil moisture, especially in the part of selecting measurement methods and reference materials that could enable comparison of the performance of the commercially available dielectric sensors.

TI  - Higher economic benefits and changes in soil fertility due to intensifying winter crop rotation in double-rice cropping systems
VL  - 157
SN  - NA
AB  - Farmers are increasingly planting vegetables during the winter fallow period in the double-rice growing area of Guangdong Province, southern China. The intensified winter crop rotation system (rice-rice-vegetable, RRV) may improve the annual planting benefit and change the soil fertility. To address this, yields, biomass, and profitability of each crop in the RRV, relative to the traditional rice-rice-fallow system (RRF), were compared, and the dynamics of physical, chemical and biological properties of soil at different crop stages were determined in this paper. The annual crop yield, biomass and economic return of RRV were significantly higher than those of RRF due to the inclusion of winter vegetables (green beans) in the cropping system. The contribution of green beans to the total revenue per year for RRV was as high as 73\%. Filling winter fallow with green beans had no influence on the yield of early and late rice. Soil NO3âˆ’-N, available P, exchangeable K, exchangeable Fe, exchangeable Cu and acid phosphatase activity at the winter stage were significantly higher in RRV than in RRF, whereas soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), exchangeable Ca, exchangeable Mg, catalase activity, dehydrogenase activity and invertase activity at the winter stage were lower. The soil NO3âˆ’-N, exchangeable Fe, exchangeable Cu, and acid phosphatase activity during the early rice stage also tended to be higher in the RRV system. The annual dynamics of soil physical, chemical and biological properties were proven to be greater in the RRV system than in the RRF system. The findings of our study contribute to the understanding of dynamic changes in physical, chemical and biological properties of soil across different crop stages due to intensified green bean planting during the winter fallow period in a double-rice cropping system, which will be useful for the sustainable development of RRV.

VL  - 2021-July

AB  - The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission design includes two instruments that make coincident active and passive measurements in the low frequency microwave L-band range. In the design, the two instruments share the large (6 meter) light-weight mesh rotating reflector and some of the antenna subsystems. The passive radiometer measurements provide measurements that are highly sensitive to surface soil moisture but at coarse resolution. The active radar measurements provide high-resolution measurements but less sensitive to soil moisture variations because of two-way attenuation through the overlying vegetation canopy and more complex rough soil surface scattering. The synergy between the active and passive measurements allows retrieval of surface soil moisture at intermediate scales and with intermediate accuracy. The SMAP radar failed after three months, thus allowing only about three months of active-passive products. The SMAP project switched to using the Copernicus Sentinel 1-A and 1-B C-band SAR measurements for its active-passive product. The disadvantage of the switch-over is the greater vegetation attenuation and more complex rough-surface scattering of C-band when compared to L-band. The advantages are greater resolution of the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The revisit times are also affected since data from two platforms with different swath widths have to be combined. In this presentation we explore the algorithm issues associated with the switch and compare the products during the period when both the SMAP radar and Sentinel-1 SARs were operating. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Characterization of agroforestry systems and their effectiveness in soil fertility enhancement in the south-west region of {Cameroon
VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop productivity depends almost entirely on the fertility of the soil. This in turn influences food security at the household level. Thus, for crop productivity to be high and ensure food security, the level of soil fertility needs to increase. However, poor agricultural practices and other phenomena such as soil erosion have led to soil infertility across Cameroon. This necessitates that more sustainable agricultural practices should be identified and vulgarized. In this light, this study was initiated to evaluate the role of different agroforestry systems (a sustainable agricultural practice), in enhancing soil fertility in order to propose an appropriate practice to farmers as a sustainable option for soil fertility improvement. The study was carried out in Mbelenka, south west region of Cameroon. Data was collected through household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and direct field observations. Findings revealed that, three main agroforestry systems (agrosilvopastoral, silvopastoral, and agrisilvicultural systems) were dominant characterized by several practices, components, and functions. Most farmers (52\%) perceived the soils to be less fertile, and the agrosilvopastoral system was perceived by most farmers (57\%) to be characterized by the highest level of soil fertility. Most farmers (53\%) equally perceived that, the agrosilvopastoral system was the most effective in enhancing soil fertility. Correlation and regression analysis showed the existence of a statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01) direct non-cause effect and a direct cause-effect relationship between soil fertility and the practice of agrosilvopastoral and agrisilvicultural agroforestry systems. This implies that, the practice of these two systems contributes towards improving soil fertility. Based on these findings, it is recommended that, farmers should practice agroforestry systems especially the agrosilvopastoral and agrisilvicultural systems, for they have huge potentials to enhance soil fertility, thereby improving crop productivity and food security.

TI  - Inter-comparison of several soil moisture downscaling methods over the {Qinghai}-{Tibet} {Plateau}, {China
VL  - 592
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave remote sensing is able to retrieve soil moisture (SM) at an adequate level of accuracy. However, these microwave remotely sensed SM products usually have a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers which cannot satisfy the requirements of fine to medium scale applications such as agricultural irrigation and local water resource management. Several SM downscaling methods have been proposed to solve this mismatch by downscaling the coarse-scale SM to fine-scale (several kilometers or hundreds of meters). Although studies have been conducted over different climatic zones and from different data sets with good results, there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison and evaluation between them to guide the production of high-resolution and high-accuracy SM data. Therefore, in this study we compared several SM downscaling methods (from 0.25Â° to 0.01Â°) based on polynormal fitting, physical model, machine learning and geostatistics over the Qinghai-Tibet plateau where there is a wide range of climate conditions from four aspects, that is, comparison with the original microwave product, comparison with in situ measurements, inter-comparison based on three-cornered hat (TCH) method, and a spatial feasibility analysis. The comparison results show that the method based on a physical model, in this case the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) method, has the highest ability on preserving the coarse-scale feature of original microwave SM product, while to some extent, this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results. In addition, soil evaporation efficiency (SEE) alone is not sufficient to represent SM spatial patterns over complex land surface. Geostatistics based area-to-area regression Kriging (ATARK) introduces the highest uncertainty caused by the overcorrection during the residual interpolation process while this process can also improve correlation (R) and correct the bias as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details. Two machine learning methods, the random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) show high stability on all comparison results but provide smoother spatial patterns. The multivariate statistical regression (MSR) method performs worst due to the fact that its simple linear regression model could not meet the requirement of SM fitting on complicated land surface. Moreover, all five downscaling methods show a declining accuracy after downscaling. This phenomenon may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine-scale. In addition, this could also be caused by the tendency that downscaled results will usually provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors, while they cannot capture the temporal changes of the microwave SM product well. In general, this phenomenon tends to be more significant over heterogeneous land surface. All in all, five widely used soil moisture downscaling methods were compared based on a comprehensive comparison scheme to add to the body of knowledge in applicability of downcaling methods under different weather conditions.

TI  - Soil fertility constraints and management to increase crop yields in the dryland farming systems of {Aceh}, {Indonesia
VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - In Aceh, Indonesia, low dryland crop yields entrench rural poverty. The lack of soil fertility information hinders the development of soil management programs to assist farmers to increase crop yield. This study identified soil-based constraints to production and management options to increase crop yield. We analysed 254 soil samples from 127 dryland cropping sites across Pidie, Bireuen, Aceh Besar and Aceh Barat districts for pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), base saturation (BS) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The dominant soils were Entisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, with some Andisols and Mollisols. Overall, the CEC range was 10-60 cmol(+) kg-1 and available P was 0.5-702 mg kg-1 but most had poor fertility: SOC {\textless} 20.0 g kg-1, total N {\textless} 2.0 g kg-1, low basic cations and BS {\textless} 40\%. The Ultisols and some Entisols and Inceptisols were acidic, with aluminium saturation {\textgreater}20\% and available P {\textless} 6.5 mg kg-1. To sustainably increase crop yield, we concluded that these soils need lime where acidic, fertilisers for nutrients and stable carbon-rich amendments for system stability. This dataset will guide future agricultural research and development programs in Aceh to improve farmer practices and food security. Â© 2021 CSIRO.

TI  - Legacy effects of soil fertility management on cereal dry matter and nitrogen grain yield of organic arable cropping systems
VL  - 122
SN  - NA
AB  - The yields of crops in organic farming are typically lower than in conventional farming, although this depend greatly on local climatic conditions and on crop and soil management. A long-term study over three consecutive 4-year cropping cycles at three locations in Denmark compared organic arable cropping systems varying in fertilization management (green manure crops, cover crops, livestock manure) to study the long-term effects of soil fertility management on crop yields. The analysis of the results showed that the nitrogen (N) derived from cover crops has a legacy effect on the dry matter and N grain yield of spring barley being traceable 5-8 years back in time. The net N input of crop residues and manure for the crop cycles 1-4 and 5-8 years prior to the winter wheat had a significant effect on both the dry matter and N grain yield of wheat. The management of organic cropping systems should focus on reducing the weed pressure, promoting soil fertility and increasing the soil N supply to optimize crop yields. For both winter wheat and spring barley, the weed pressure reduced both crop dry matter and the N grain yield. A cover crop as pre-crop had a significant positive effect on both dry matter and N yield of spring barley, while a cover crop in the rotation did not significantly affect grain yield of winter wheat. For both winter wheat and spring barley, manure application was most effective in increasing crop yields. However, N in applied crop residues also had considerable yield-enhancing effects. For winter wheat, the N inputs from crop residues from previous crop rotation cycles (1-4 and 5-8 years) significantly increased yields, while for spring barley, N input in crop residues from incorporated cover crop and the long-term crop rotation cycle (5-8 years) significantly enhanced both dry matter and N grain yield. These legacy effects of soil fertility management through enhancing and retaining organic N inputs of organic arable cropping suggest that a holistic approach to soil and crop management is necessary, and this needs to focus on increasing weed suppression, soil fertility and targeting manure inputs for enhanced N uptake.

AB  - Onion is an important vegetable crop, predominantly grown under conventional tillage system management. Alternatively, the vegetable no-tillage system uses cover crops to form a residue layer, which improves soil physical, chemical, and biological attributes. Aiming to understand the interaction of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal cover crops, phosphatase activity, and soil phosphorus availability and uptake by plants, a no-tillage vegetable production system experiment with onion was carried out in Ituporanga, Southern Brazil. The treatments were black oats (Avena strigosa); rye (Secale cereale); oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus); rye + oilseed radish; black oats + oilseed radish, and a control with spontaneous plants. Additionally, two plots, a conventional tillage system area and a forest, both adjacent to the experiment, were evaluated. We measured cover crop biomass, onion yield, acid phosphatase activity, and resin-extracted phosphorus in the soil, shoot and root phosphorus content, and root colonization in cover crops, spontaneous plants, and onions. The treatments with cover crops had the highest plant biomass in winter and onion yield. Available soil phosphorus and acid phosphatase activity were higher in no-tillage plots than in the conventional tillage system area. The presence of non-mycorrhizal oilseed radish was associated with decreased colonization of rye and onion roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. No-tillage areas with cover crops or spontaneous plants in winter accumulated more phosphorus than conventional tillage system areas. The conventional tillage system showed adverse effects on most soil attributes, as shown by a Principal Component Analysis. Â© 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Remote sensing and Interference detector with radiomeTry and vegetation Analysis (RITA) payload is one of the Remote Sensing payloads selected by the 2nd GRSS Student Grand Challenge in 2019 to fly on board of a 3U satellite that is being developed at the National space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC), United Arab Emirates University. RITA has been designed as an academic mission with a strong focus on Earth Observation techniques and technologies. This payload is equipped with a Software-Defined Radio for microwave radiometry and RFI detection, a hyper-spectral camera (25 bands from 600 to 975 nm), and a LoRa transceiver, which will work in tandem to produce vegetation-related measurements with improved accuracy. Soil moisture measurements, for example, will be derived from a Total Power Microwave Radiometer working at L-band and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measurements in a technique known as Pixel Downscaling. In this work, recent advances in the payload design will be presented, as well as a more in depth mission analysis. Â©2021 IEEE

TI  - Comparison of {Vis}/{SWNIR} and {NIR} spectrometers combined with different multivariate techniques for estimating soil fertility parameters of calcareous topsoil in an arid climate
VL  - 201
SN  - NA
AB  - The lab spectroscopy using Vis/SWNIR and NIR spectrometers was used to estimate the major fertility parameters in calcareous topsoil from arid region of central Iran. The fertility parameters included soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (P-avl), and available potassium (K-avl). A total of 151 samples were collected from the depth of 0â€“20 cm, and the diffuse reflectance spectra of them were collected using charge-coupled device (CCD) and indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) spectrometers. To extract the prediction models, partial least squares (PLS) as linear, and artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) as nonlinear multivariate techniques were used. The CCD-based spectra combined with the ANN model led to excellent predictability for SOM (residual predictive deviation (RPD) = 2.60), TN (RPD = 2.54), and P-avl (RPD = 3.01) and very good prediction for K-avl (RPD = 2.02). However, the InGaAs-based spectrometer outperformed the CCD one for predicting all the soil fertility parameters. The best prediction models were obtained from the nonlinear multivariate techniques where the excellent predictions were provided by the ANN model for SOM (R2p = 0.941; RPD = 3.27), P-avl (R2p = 0.902; RPD = 3.34), and K-avl (R2p = 0.863; RPD = 2.69) and by SVM for TN (R2p = 0.863; RPD = 2.91). This study revealed that despite the great potential of InGaAs spectrometers for predicting the soil fertility parameters, the low-cost CCD-based spectrometer could result in satisfactory performance when the appropriate nonlinear technique is used for data analysis.

AB  - Agricultural water management is key for a sustainable agricultural productivity. Accurate soil moisture measurements are essential in irrigation management, hydrological modelling, ground water recharge, flood, and drought forecasting. There are many different techniques for estimating soil moisture at different scales, from point to landscape scales. In this paper, we used a modified version of change detection approach for near surface soil moisture modelling coupled with a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) installed at a field site 100 km outside Vienna, Austria. The model allows a conversion of Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization into soil moisture. The model is calibrated with 2019 CRNS data and validated with data from 2020 to 2021. The results showed the good performance of the model with a high correlation for the calibration (R2 = 0.81) and predicted the soil moisture with an absolute error of 0.2\%. This study is a major step in the monitoring of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution by combining remote sensing and the CRNS based nuclear technology. Â© 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Oil palm is one of the plantation commodities that has an important role in the economy of Indonesia. The high demand for palm oil in the future must be supported by high productivity. Fertilization is one of the intensification methods to increase oil palm productivity. The main nutrient content in oil palm that helps the growth and development of oil palm is nitrogen. Soil samples and location coordinates were taken from oil palm plantations then adjusted to Sentinel-1 satellite images. The Sentinel-1 image obtained is then processed first to reduce the factors that aggravate the process afterward. The digital number value obtained from the reflection of the Sentinel-1 image was then used as an independent variable and the soil nitrogen results from the laboratory become the dependent variable. Data were trained and a model was built using Random Forest Regressor (RFR) and Multi Linear Regression (MLR). All models built were evaluated by the quality of the model using MAPE and the best model was determined by selecting the lowest MAPE. RFR model has 19.53\% of MAPE and MLR has 22.41\% of MAPE. The RFR is chosen to be the best model based on the lowest MAPE and based on interpretation, the RFR model has good accuracy for determining soil nitrogen nutrient content better than MLR model.

AB  - Assessment of soil fertility levels is a prerequisite in developing a sustainable and productive agroecosystem. The traditional soil fertility assessment approach is costly in terms of both economy and time. The spatial data can be easily assembled, stored, displayed, and analyzed using the Geographical Information System (GIS). However, it includes finite analytical modeling approaches. Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approaches and GIS can be merged in a cooperative framework to address such limitations. In the present study, a web-GIS-based, Multicriteria Decision Support System has been proposed to assess agricultural soil fertility. The proposed framework employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model and various important physicochemical and nutrient contents of soil to ascertain the fertility levels of the different fields in the study area. The proposed framework recommends fertilizer requirements into the categories of low, moderate, and high levels according to the soil fertility levels. The accuracy of 85.2\% reveals the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Â© 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In most parts of the world, agriculture is an important source of livelihood. This entails hard work, but it contributes to the nation's food safety and health. The harvest majorly depends on soil fertility, moisture level and also the level of fertilizers used. Time and distance are the major factors that limits farmers in performing the laboratory analysis of nutrients. Due to this inconvenience caused, nutrient testing is not performed regularly, which results the soil to lose its fertility. Using the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) a system is proposed which adopts precision agriculture in order to overcome such drawbacks and to remotely monitor the soil characteristics like soil moisture and its nutrients. Awareness about the quantity of nutrients present in the soil is essential to ensure optimum usage of fertilizers and constant monitoring of irrigation is also required for better productivity. The sensors are integrated with arduino microcontroller and the values obtained from the sensors are transmitted to the cloud and displayed in a mobile application. The proposed IoT based software system has the intelligence to measure the moisture level and quantity of the nutrients using colorimetry which improves the quality of the soil and ensures optimum growth of the crop.

TI  - Review of novel and emerging proximal soil moisture sensors for use in agriculture
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - The measurement of soil moisture in agriculture is currently dominated by a small number of sensors, the use of which is greatly limited by their small sampling volume, high cost, need for close soilâ€“sensor contact, and poor performance in saline, vertic and stony soils. This review was undertaken to explore the plethora of novel and emerging soil moisture sensors, and evaluate their potential use in agriculture. The review found that improvements to existing techniques over the last two decades are limited, and largely restricted to frequency domain reflectometry approaches. However, a broad range of new, novel and emerging means of measuring soil moisture were identified including, actively heated fiber optics (AHFO), high capacity tensiometers, paired acoustic / radio / seismic transceiver approaches, microwave-based approaches, radio frequency identification (RFID), hydrogels and seismoelectric approaches. Excitement over this range of potential new technologies is however tempered by the observation that most of these technologies are at early stages of development, and that few of these techniques have been adequately evaluated in situ agricultural soils.

TI  - Analysis of the variability in soil moisture measurements by capacitance sensors in a drip-irrigated orchard
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Among the diverse techniques for monitoring soil moisture, capacitance-type soil moisture sensors are popular because of their low cost, low maintenance requirements, and acceptable performance. However, although in laboratory conditions the accuracy of these sensors is good, when installed in the field they tend to show large sensor-to-sensor differences, especially under drip irrigation. It makes difficult to decide in which positions the sensors are installed and the interpretation of the recorded data. The aim of this paper is to study the variability involved in the measurement of soil moisture by capacitance sensors in a drip-irrigated orchard and, using this information, find ways to optimize their usage to manage irrigation. For this purpose, the study examines the uncertainties in the measurement process plus the natural variability in the actual soil water dynamics. Measurements were collected by 57 sensors, located at 10 combinations of depth and position relative to the dripper Our results showed large sensor-to-sensor differences, even when installed at equivalent depth and coordinates relative to the drippers. In contrast, differences among virtual sensors simulated using a HYDRUS-3D model at those soil locations were one order of magnitude smaller. Our results highlight, as a possible cause for the sensor-to-sensor differences in the measurements by capacitance sensors, the natural variability in size, shape, and centering of the wet area below the drippers, combined with the sharply defined variation in water content at the soil scale perceived by the sensors.

TI  - Regulation of agrophysical indicators of degraded sod-podzolic soil fertility using a system of fertilizers and predecessors
VL  - 548
SN  - NA
AB  - Experimental data on the dynamics of the most important agrophysical indicators of soil fertility which were obtained against the background of various fertilizer systems and predecessors in the development of degraded reclaimed lands that were withdrawn from circulation are presented. It has been shown that the rate of formation of a macrostructure that is valuable in production (0.25-10 mm) strongly depends on the amount of organic matter entering the soil in the form of high doses of all types of organic fertilizers, green manure and crop-root residues, upon decomposition of which an active humus is formed, which, when interacting with calcium, impregnates and cements the soil lumps, transforming them into a water-insoluble form. The greatest positive influence on the structural coefficient is exerted by cultivation of barley according to the organic background with the introduction of manure (40 ... 80 t / ha) or liquid runoff of livestock complexes (120 t / ha) in combination with sowing application 10 kg a.v. P2O5 and 30 kg a.m. nitrogen as a top dressing per 1 ha. It has been established that in order to improve agrophysical parameters when degraded lands are involved in agricultural production, along with the introduction of high doses of organic fertilizers, crops with a deeply penetrating, powerfully developed root system that can not only condense the arable and plow layers, reduce acidity should be sown soil, but also at the same time improve its structure.

TI  - Bacterivorous nematodes correlate with soil fertility and improved crop production in an organic minimum tillage system
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Reduced nutrient mineralization rates under minimum tillage are usually compensated by mineral fertilizer application. These, however, cannot be applied in organic farming systems. We hypothesized that an organic minimum tillage system based on frequent cover cropping and application of dead mulch would improve soil fertility and compensate for the potential negative effects of minimum tillage. Two long-term field experiments were set up in 2010 and 2011 to compare plowing versus minimum tillage including the application of transferred mulch. A second factor, the application of compost versus mineral potassium and phosphorus, was also compared. In 2019, soils were analyzed for soil pH, organic carbon, macro- and micronutrients, microbial biomass, microbial activity, and total nematode abundance. In addition, performance of pea in the same soils was determined under greenhouse conditions. Across both experiments, macronutrients (+52\%), micronutrients (+11\%), microbial biomass (+51\%), microbial activity (+86\%), and bacterivorous nematodes (+112\%) increased in minimum tillage compared to the plow-based system. In the greenhouse, pea biomass was 45\% higher in the soil that had been subjected to minimum tillage compared to the plow. In conclusion, soil fertility can be improved in organic minimum tillage systems, which include intensive cover cropping and the application of dead mulch, over plow-based systems.

AB  - The mission of the Consortium on Global International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is to reduce poverty and enhance food, water, nutritional security, and environmental health in the face of global challenges, including climate change. It operates worldwide through a network of 15 international research centers. One of these institutions, The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has focused on dryland agriculture in the Mediterranean region, specifically in West Asiaâ€“North Africa (WANA). Soil fertility, agronomy, and crop nutrition were key areas of its research program. This mini review highlights the research achievements at ICARDA with respect to nitrogen, phosphorus, micronutrients, nutrient dynamics, fertilizer use, soil testing, sustainable cropping and/or crop rotations, and conservation tillage. Despite the destruction of the Center's headquarters in the ongoing civil war and its dispersion in the region, the legacy of ICARDA will survive through documentation of its research in the international literature.

TI  - Spatial variability in soybean associated with soil fertility variations in a no-tillage system
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the spatial variability of soil fertility is necessary for preventing nutrient losses or excessive agricultural inputs. The aim of this research was to evaluate the spatial variability of the chemical characteristics of a Typic Hapludox cultivated with soybean for 110 days at different depths and the impacts of these characteristics on crop yield. Soil samples were collected at a total of 80 points in an area of 5000 m2. The contents of P, Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn were analyzed, in addition to pH and H+Al. The data were evaluated through descriptive statistics and geostatistical tools, and kriging maps were made based on semivariogram adjustments. Most of the soil fertility variables showed moderate or strong spatial dependence. The statistical moments obtained for the distributions showed that the symmetry of the distributions allowed the use of geostatistics techniques. In general, the greater the soil depth was, the lower the nutrient levels were. The soybean yield range (29.5 m) was similar to the P range in the 0.0-0.20 m soil layer (29.2 m). P influenced the soybean yield the most, as expressed by the similarity between the two kriging maps. In regions with more phosphorus at deeper soil layers, higher soybean yields were obtained.

TI  - Airborne multi-frequency microwave radiometric measurements in synergy with {SAR} data for the retrieval of soil moisture
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In the framework of a project funded by the Italian Space Agency (Algoritmi-METEMW), experimental activities based on airborne multi-frequency microwave radiometric measurements and simultaneous ground-truth data collection have been carried out in Central Italy, in an agricultural area close to Florence. The aim of the project was the development of innovative algorithms for the estimate of hydrological parameters integrating active and passive microwave data. The retrieval algorithms are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). IFAC multi-frequency microwave radiometers (at L, C, and X bands) have been installed on ultralight helicopters, which overflew the area in concomitance with SMAP and Sentinel-1 (S-1) image acquisitions. Comparisons of new data with past results confirmed the already stated relationships between microwave indices and soil and vegetation parameters. Soil moisture content (SMC) values estimated from L-band radiometric data are very close to those retrieved using the ANN algorithm. This result confirms the possibility of validating satellite algorithms with airborne microwave radiometers. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Evaluating soil nutrients of {Dacrydium} pectinatum in {China} using machine learning techniques
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Background: The accurate estimation of soil nutrient content is particularly important in view of its impact on plant growth and forest regeneration. In order to investigate soil nutrient content and quality for the natural regeneration of Dacrydium pectinatum communities in China, designing advanced and accurate estimation methods is necessary. Methods: This study uses machine learning techniques created a series of comprehensive and novel models from which to evaluate soil nutrient content. Soil nutrient evaluation methods were built by using six support vector machines and four artificial neural networks. Results: The generalized regression neural network model was the best artificial neural network evaluation model with the smallest root mean square error (5.1), mean error (âˆ’ 0.85), and mean square prediction error (29). The accuracy rate of the combined k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) local support vector machines model (i.e. k-nearest neighbors -support vector machine (KNNSVM)) for soil nutrient evaluation was high, comparing to the other five partial support vector machines models investigated. The area under curve value of generalized regression neural network (0.6572) was the highest, and the cross-validation result showed that the generalized regression neural network reached 92.5\%. Conclusions: Both the KNNSVM and generalized regression neural network models can be effectively used to evaluate soil nutrient content and quality grades in conjunction with appropriate model variables. Developing a new feasible evaluation method to assess soil nutrient quality for Dacrydium pectinatum, results from this study can be used as a reference for the adaptive management of rare and endangered tree species. This study, however, found some uncertainties in data acquisition and model simulations, which will be investigated in upcoming studies. Â© 2020, The Author(s).

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Dielectric sensors operating in time and frequency domain can be used to determine soil moisture content. There is still a need for developing new sensors for determination of soil water content, in order to further improve measurement accuracy, lower the price or adapt the equipment for special applications. For example, many of the existing soil moisture probes do not allow accurate measurement of dielectric properties in a small volume because of their construction. The paper presents the evaluation of a seven-rod probe for an accurate determination of soil water content in a small sample volume. Firstly, digital simulations for sensitivity zone of the tested probe were performed. Next, the prototype probe was tested for two soils with various texture and moisture content in the range from air dry to near saturation. The values of dielectric permittivity (frequency domain) and apparent dielectric permittivity (time domain) were calculated from the measured S$_{\textrm{11}}$ parameters. The obtained data was compared with the reference Topp's equation. It was concluded that the tested probe is able to measure soil moisture in a small volume (about 8 cm3) in the range of frequencies from 20 MHz to 200 MHz. Â© 2020 Warsaw University of Technology.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation and spatial pattern analysis of soil moisture in {Shiyang} {River} {Basin} with vegetation coverage
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is the link between the surface and the atmosphere, and it plays a key role in vegetation growth and efficient agricultural irrigation. Taking the Shiyang River Basin as the research area, using the vegetation coverage/surface albedo trapezoidal characteristic spatial scatter plot to calculate the bare soil albedo, reducing the error of vegetation on the soil moisture obtained by remote sensing, and improving the accuracy of remote sensing soil moisture estimation. At the same time, the spatial pattern of SM and its influencing factors are analyzed through stability, spatial autocorrelation and geographic detectors. The results show that: (1) The SM inversion accuracy of the bare soil albedo model in the Shiyang River Basin is relatively high, which provides a new method for the calculation of SM at the basin scale. (2) SM has obvious spatial autocorrelation, Moran's value is 0.88 (Z- score=1852.94, P {\textless}0.01), the upstream woodland is high-high aggregation, the downstream desert is low-low aggregation, and SM is significantly correlated with FVC (P {\textless}0.01). (3) The overall stability of SM in the Shiyang River Basin during the year was good, and areas with good stability and good stability accounted for 88.34\% of the study area. (4) The spatial distribution of SM is affected by multiple factors, and the explanatory power of each factor is significantly different. Among them, vegetation coverage{\textgreater} soil type{\textgreater} elevation{\textgreater} land use, and the interaction between factors enhances the explanatory power of the spatial differentiation of SM. (5) The SM of different land use types is quite different. Among them, most of the unused land is less than 7\%; the SM of grassland and cultivated land is at the middle level, with an SM value of 7\%-15\%; the level of woodland is the highest, with an SM value greater than 25\% .

AB  - Soil moisture is a critical parameter for microwave remote sensing. In this paper, a probe based on a microstrip resonance ring (MRR) is designed. The fitting curve between resonant frequency, Q-factor, and complex dielectric constant are obtained by electromagnetic simulation. To measure the moisture of soil, a density-independent factor is introduced to remove the effect of density of soil, which makes this sensor more accurate and easy to use, especially suitable for fieldwork. The experimental results show that this sensor works very well in measuring moisture and complex dielectric constant of soil. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Estimating soil moisture using {Sentinel}-1 and {Sentinel}-2 sensors for dryland and palustrine wetland areas
VL  - 116
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an important role in the hydrological functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing shows potential for the quantification and monitoring of the SMC of palustrine wetlands; however, this technique remains to be assessed across a wetlandâ€“terrestrial gradient in South Africa. The ability of the Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which are freely available from the European Space Agency, were evaluated to predict SMC for a palustrine wetland and surrounding terrestrial areas in the grassland biome of South Africa. The percentage of volumetric water content (\%VWC) was measured across the wetland and terrestrial areas of the Colbyn Wetland Nature Reserve, located in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality of the Gauteng Province, using a handheld SMT-100 soil moisture meter at a depth of 5 cm during the peak and end of the hydroperiod in 2018. The \%VWC was regressed against the Sentinel imagery, using random forest, simple linear and support vector machine regression models. Random forest yielded the highest prediction accuracies in comparison to the other models. The results indicate that the Sentinel images have the potential to be used to predict SMC with a high coefficient of determination (Sentinel-1 SAR = R2{\textgreater}0.9; Sentinel-2 optical = R2{\textgreater}0.9) and a relatively low root mean square error (Sentinel-1 RMSE ={\textless}17\%; Sentinel-2 optical = RMSE {\textless}21\%). Predicted maps show higher ranges of SMC for wetlands ({\textgreater} 50\%VWC; p{\textless}0.05) compared to terrestrial areas, and therefore SMC monitoring may benefit the inventorying of wetlands, as well as monitoring of their extent and ecological condition. Significance: â€¢ The freely available and space-borne Sentinel sensors show potential for the quantification of surface soil moisture across a wetlandâ€“terrestrial gradient. â€¢ Significant differences between the surface soil moisture of palustrine wetlands and terrestrial areas, imply that inventorying and monitoring of the extent and hydroperiod of palustrine wetlands can potentially be done.

TI  - Cover crops as the main element of biologization of agriculture in the no-till system for reproduction of soil fertility
VL  - 210
SN  - NA
AB  - The goal is to develop the main elements of biologization of the No-till system in the conditions of the Piedmont-steppe zone of Crimea, to study the effect of various types of ground cover crops on soil fertility, yield and grain quality of agricultural crops in conditions of insufficient and unstable moisture. When intermediate crops were cultivated as ground cover crops in the No-till system, the available moisture reserves in the meter layer were at a satisfactory level after vetch cultivation - 107.6 mm and in the control (without ground cover crops) - 99.6 mm. The highest yield of green mass of ground cover crops was in all variants with the use of multicomponent mixtures, which was 2 or more times higher than the yield of intermediate ground cover crops from 1-2 and 3 spring crops and almost 10 times higher than that of winter rye. This made it possible to fix 30-33 kg of nitrogen, 4-5.9 kg of phosphorus and 13.9-16.7 kg of potassium in plants and in the root system annually by the end of the growing season of spring crops per hectare of sowing.

TI  - Evaluation of nitrogen fertilization systems based on the in-season variability in the nitrogenous growth factor and soil fertility factorsâ€”a case of winter oilseed rape ({Brassica} napus l.)
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Application of nitrogen (N) in contrastive chemical form changes availability of soil nutrients, affecting crop response. This hypothesis was evaluated based on field experiments conducted in 2015/16 and 2016/2017. The experiment consisted of three nitrogen fertilization systems: mineral-ammonium nitrate (AN) (M-NFS), organic-digestate (O-NFS),2/3 digestate +1/3 AN (OM-NFS), and N rates: 0, 80, 120, 160; 240 kg haâˆ’1 . The content of nitrogen nitrate (N-NO3) and available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) were determined at rosette, onset of flowering, and maturity of winter oilseed rape (WOSR) growth from three soil layers: 0.0â€“0.3, 0.3â€“0.6, 0.6â€“0.9 m. The optimum N rates were: 139, 171 and 210 kg haâˆ’1 for the maximum yield of 3.616, 3.887, 4.195 t haâˆ’1, for M-NFS, O-NFS, OM-NFS. The N-NO3 content at rosette of 150 kg haâˆ’1 and its decrease to 48 kg haâˆ’1 at the onset of flowering was the prerequisite of high yield. The key factor limiting yield in the M-NFS was the shortage of Ca, Mg, O-NFSâ€”shortage of N-NO3 . Plants in the OM-NFS were well-balanced due to a positive impact of the subsoil Mg and Ca on the N-NO3 content and productivity. The rosette stage was revealed as the cardinal for the correction of WOSR N nutritional status. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Farmersâ€™ {Perceptions} as a {Driver} of {Agricultural} {Practices}: {Understanding} {Soil} {Fertility} {Management} {Practices} in {Cocoa} {Agroforestry} {Systems} in {Cameroon
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - In Africa, cocoa yields are low, partly due to soil fertility constraints and poor management. While peoplesâ€™ knowledge, aspirations, and abilities are key factors explaining their behaviour, little is known about the rationales that underpin soil fertility management practices (SFMPs) of cocoa farmers. To address this gap, we conducted an exploratory survey in two contrasting regions in Cameroon where cocoa is an important crop: the humid forest and the forest-savannah transition zone. Some 30\% of farmers in the transition zone as opposed to 13\% in the humid forest expressed concerns about soil fertility. The most relevant soil fertility indicators for farmers were high cocoa yield, dark soil colour, ease of tillage, and floral composition. To enhance and maintain soil fertility, farmers used residues from weeding (100\%), planting of trees (42\%), mineral fertilisers (33\%), compost (16\%), and manure (13\%). More farmers in the transition zone than the humid forest implemented SFMPs. Our findings suggest that soil fertility perceptions, access to inputs, local practices, and experience influence farmersâ€™ use of SFMPs. The limited use of mineral fertilisers was explained by poor access whereas the use of organic fertilisers and tree planting were mostly constrained by lack of labour and knowledge. Farmers prioritised practices to increase yield and viewed SFMPs to be the least important management practices, although they believe high cocoa yield is an important indicator of soil fertility. To foster sustainable cocoa intensification, it is necessary to enhance farmersâ€™ knowledge on SFMPs, increase access to inputs, and ensure returns on investment while considering farmersâ€™ priorities and practices.

SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient estimation can be used as a key input to increase crop yield and agriculture fertilization. Due to the shortage of the ground measured spectrum technology and costliness to obtain hyperspectral images, multispectral remote sensing data is used to explore the soil nutrient content estimation. In this paper, we have used optical remote sensing data (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), terrain/climate data (precipitation, radiation, slope etc.) and ground truth value to estimate four nutrients: N, K, P, and OC for two districts of Maharashtra, India. We compared four linear and non-linear regression models: multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine for regression (SVR) and gradient boosting (GB) for estimation of NPK and OC. Comparative results suggest that, GB and RFR performed better than other models with sMAPE in range of 0.125-0.377 for all nutrients, which is better or comparable with literature reported accuracy [1]. Therefore, the approach has potential to generate high resolution ({\textless} ha) soil nutrients map and can reduce soil sampling effort/cost. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - The applicability of the cosmic ray neutron sensor to simultaneously monitor soil water content and biomass in an acacia mearnsii forest
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content is an important hydrological parameter, which is dicult to measure at a field scale due to its spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) is a novel and innovative approach to estimate area-averaged soil water content at an intermediate scale, which has been implemented across the globe. The CRNS is moderated by all hydrogen sources within its measurement footprint. In order to isolate the soil water content signal from the neutron intensity, the other sources of hydrogen need to be accounted for. The CRNS's applications are not only limited to soil water content estimation, as it can potentially be used to monitor biomass. The Two-Streams clear-felling provided the unique opportunity to monitor the cosmic ray neutron intensities before, during, and after the clear-felling. The cadmium-dierence method was used to obtain the pure thermal and epithermal neutron intensities from the bare and moderated detectors. The study concluded that the presence of biomass within the site reduced the epithermal neutron intensity by 12.43\% and the N0 value by 13.8\%. The use of the neutron ratio to monitor biomass was evaluated and changes in the neutron ratio coincided with biomass changes and resulted in a high correlation (R2 of 0.868) with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and (R2 of 0.817) leaf area index (LAI). The use of the CRNS to simultaneously monitor soil water content and biomass will be beneficial in providing more reliable soil water content estimates, provide biomass estimates at a field scale, and aid in understanding the dynamics between soil water content and vegetation.

VL  - 49

AB  - A field study was conducted to analyze the effect of long term use of organic and inorganic fertilizers on productivity and soil fertility under paddy-sesame cropping system. Application of 100\% NPK + secondary and micro-nutrients based on soil test (T7) showed significantly higher mean grain yield of paddy (4735 kg/ha) and sesame (460 kg/ha) and rice equivalent yield (5348 kg/ha) followed by application of 50\% NPK + 50\% N as Farmyard manure (FYM) + inorganic source of micronutrients as per soil test (T1). Whereas, application of 50\% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) through FYM + bio-fertilizers for N + Recommended dose of phosphorus (RDP) through rock phosphate + phosphorus solubalizing bacteria (PSB) showed significantly least mean grain yield of paddy (3209 kg/ha) and sesame (314 kg/ha) and rice equivalent yield (3628 kg/ha). Further, among organic treatments (T2 to T6), higher mean grain yield of paddy (3834 kg/ha), sesame (326 kg/ha) and rice equivalent yield (4269 kg/ha) as compared to other treatments was recorded following the application of one third of RDN through FYM + one third of RDN through vermicompost + one third of RDN through neem cake + bio-fertilizers containing N and P carriers (T6). Whereas, higher nutrient status with respect to major and micronutrients and the improved soil fertility status was recorded in organic treatment plots. The application of nutrients through organic sources would improve the soil fertility status under paddy-sesame cropping system. Â© 2020 Bangladesh Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since 2018, the Terrestrial Hydrology Experiment in Mexico (THExMEX-18) is being part of SMAP algorithm validation through soil moisture (SM), crop measurements, and biomass samples that were collected over a rainfed agricultural region of Huamantla, Tlaxcala. As a second part of this experiment, THExMEX-19 was carried out in whole crop season from March to December 2019. In order to help to validate to SMAP algorithm applying NASA's protocols, both joint efforts of National Polytechnic Institute and Center for Remote Sensing of the University of Florida have obtained these results in 2018 and 2019. In-Situ soil moisture measurements are compared with the enhanced soil moisture SMAP level 2 passive observation (SMAP L2-SM-P and SMAP L2-SM-P-E) and soil moisture SMAP level 2 and Sentinel-1 passive observation (SMAP L2-SM-SP). SMAP mission meets the requirement of SM retrievals with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) {\textless} 0.04 (m3 m-3) compared to in-situ measurements over agricultural fields. The L-band passive SM retrievals and in-situ measurements were evaluated in terms of four statistical metrics: root-mean-square difference (RMSD), bias, ubRMSD, and correlation coefficient (r).

TI  - Climate and soil micro-organisms drive soil phosphorus fractions in coastal dune systems
VL  - 34
SN  - NA
AB  - The importance of soil phosphorus (P) is likely to increase in coming decades due to the growing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition originated by industrial and agricultural activities. We currently lack a proper understanding of the main drivers of soil P pools in coastal dunes, which rank among the most valued priority conservation areas worldwide. Here, we evaluated the joint effects of biotic (i.e. microbial abundance and richness, vegetation and cryptogams cover) and abiotic (i.e. pH and aridity) factors on labile, medium-lability and recalcitrant soil P pools across a wide aridity gradient in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Climate determined the availability of medium-lability, recalcitrant and total P, but had a minor net effect on labile P, which was positively and significantly related to the presence of plants, mosses and lichens. Medium-lability P was significantly influenced by soil bacterial richness and abundance (positively and negatively, respectively). Our results suggest that micro-organisms transfer P from medium-lability pool to more labile one. At the same time, increases in bacterial richness associated to biofilms might be involved in the thickening of the medium-lability P pool in our climosequence. These bacterial-mediated transfers would confer resistance to the labile P pool under future climate change and uncover an important role of soil micro-organisms as modulators of the geochemical P cycle.

TI  - Soil moisture and drought monitoring in casablanca-settat region, {Morocco} by the use of gis and remote sensing
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key factor in climate, hydrology, and agronomy. Its assessment is therefore important and constitutes an alert parameter for desertification. It impacts the heat and mass transfers between soil and atmosphere. However, information access in the regional or global scale is very complicated which usually leads to a rough estimate, or completely disregard of this parameter. Today, remote sensing offers a solution to this problem by providing access to this information through the satellite images. The use of geospatial data to generate adequate information on droughts, we applied the remote sensing method based on the use of the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), which in its algorithm uses the data obtained from satellite sensors. As reported by Hunt et al., The index is based on actual water content (), water capacity and wilting point. The multispectral satellite images from the visible (red band) and infrared (near-infrared and thermal band) bands are essential for the calculation of the index, which is why we used Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS in this context, then SMOS disaggregated data is chosen to be compared with SMI and MI (Moisture Index) used in this work. On the other side, drought monitoring in Morocco faces complexity in the evidence that it depends on a lot of parameters including the SM. Thus, the aim of this paper is firstly to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of SM from SMOS in Casablanca-Settat region of Morocco site during five successive years 2013 to 2017. For that, the first temporal SM values mapping of the study area is established for each year of 2013 to 2017. Next, for each year we will compare SM from SMOS with SMI by drawing the graph line of SM variability in this period and generating differences maps. Secondly, we will evaluate the effect and the impact of Soil Moisture Index (SMI) in Drought monitoring by calculation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and define which indexes are more indicated for assessing soil conditions.

TI  - Recognizing the role of plant species composition in the modification of soil nutrients and water in rubber agroforestry systems
VL  - 723
SN  - NA
AB  - Reliable guidance for crop selection and related management to achieve sustainable soil resource use in rubber agroforestry systems is limited. One important reason for this limited guidance is that our understanding of the effects of different plant functional groups on soil resources is still insufficient. Here, to examine the effects of the species composition of trees, shrubs and herbs on soil nutrients and soil water with increases in the complexity of the plant community structure, we measured the soil nutrient concentrations (i.e., C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg), soil water content and soil water residence time (with stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope tracers) at six soil depths in a monoculture rubber plantation, four multi-species rubber agroforestry systems, and a tropical rainforest. As the plant species composition increased, the soil C and N increased. The soil water content also increased with increases in soil C and N. However, the effects of plant species composition on the soil water content gradually changed from positive to negative, especially under the effects of herb species, which could accelerate soil water drainage and hence shorten the soil water residence time. Therefore, the faster water infiltration and potentially higher flow of soil water in complex plant communities increased the risk and magnitude of mineral nutrient leaching. In addition, as the plant composition increased, plant competition decreased the concentration of soil nutrients, especially soil P, K and Ca. In general, plant interspecific interactions definitively decreased soil mineral nutrients as the plant composition increased, and the effects of tree, shrub and herb species on soil nutrients and soil water differed and sometimes appeared contradictory. However, the effects of plant species composition on soil gradually weakened with increases in soil depth. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil moisture is one of key environmental variables that affect vegetation cover and energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. Satellite remote sensing technology can provide information for monitoring large-scale soil moisture dynamics quickly. The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) acts as an effective indicator of inferring soil moisture status which is calculated according to the empirical parameterization of composed of the land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) characteristic space. In this paper, the MODIS TVDI was calculated based on MODIS LST product (MOD11A2, 1 km) and NDVI data (derived from MOD09A1, 500m). Meanwhile, LST and NDVI from Landsat8 OLI images were estimated to obtain Landsat-based TVDI. Then, a Kalman filter algorithm was used to simulate TVDI time series data with 30m resolution and a revisit period of 8 days combining TVDI derived from Landsat and MODIS data. We selected the west of the Songnen Plain, China as the test area and high quality cloudy-free images during growing season (April to October) of 2018 as the input data. The predicted TVDI time series data of medium resolution not only improved the temporal resolution to capture the changes at fine scale within a short period, but also made up for the deficiency of low spatial resolution MODIS data. The results show that it is feasible to generate medium or high resolution TVDI time series data by applying different remote sensing data by Kalman filtering algorithm. Â© 2020 H. Zhai et al.

TI  - Mulching techniques: {An} approach for offsetting soil moisture deficit and enhancing manure mineralization during maize cultivation
VL  - 200
SN  - NA
AB  - Mulching is an effective technique for soil moisture conservation and increasing mineralization. Four mulching practices (i.e. no-mulch, canola residue, transparent and blue plastic) and five nitrogen (N) treatments (i.e. no-N, 100, 70, 50, 0 \% from farmyard manure (FYM) with remaining from urea) to supply a total of 250 kg N haâˆ’1 were assessed under field and lab conditions for soil moisture conservation and quantification of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and mineral nitrogen (min-N) contents in 2013-14. A total of 40 \% added water to the soil was lost in no-mulching compared to 7 \% been lost in plastic mulching during first week in open shed. Based on moisture losses, three moisture regimes were developed and used in a 56 days incubation experiment. The 60 \% relative water holding capacity (RWHC) corresponding to plastic mulching had lowered SOM (1.0 \%), and TN (1.6 \%) but increased min-N (5.9\%) than 40\% RWHC (corresponding to no-mulch). Among the nitrogen treatments, 100\% FYM had improved SOM and TN, but mineralization was higher in 50\% FYM/urea. In field studies, the canola residue mulching had increased the SOM (8.4\%), TN (1.2\%), min-N (5.2\%) and moisture contents (5.7\%) over no-mulching. The 100\% FYM had higher SOM (2.25 folds), TN (2.79 folds) and moisture content (11.3\%) than control. In conclusion, soil fertility was improved with 100\% FYM and mineral N with 50\% FYM/urea. Thus, 100\% FYM or 50 \%FYM + 50 \% urea sources to provide 250 kg N ha-1 should be used with plastic mulching in weed infested area or residue mulch in weeds free field conditions for improving mineralization and water conservation.

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to further to improve the monitoring accuracy of soil moisture spatial and temporal changes in Guangxi, this paper uses MODIS, Landsat8, ASTER GDEM data and measured relative soil moisture data as data sources. According to the design idea of complementary advantages, the EVI value of Landsat8 image is partitioned, and the relative soil moisture is inverted by ATI model method in the area of EVIâ‰¤0.33, and the relative soil moisture is inverted by TVDI model in the area of EVI{\textgreater}0.33. The apparent thermal inertia model (ATI) and the temperature vegetation drought index model (TVDI) was used to invert the relative soil moisture in Guangxi . The results show that the temporal variation of relative soil moisture in the study area in 2017 is the change cycle from rising to falling: the rising period is from January to July, and the falling period is from August to December, in which the relative soil moisture reaches the peak in July. The minimum value are December; the relative soil moisture in the north of Guangxi are generally higher than that in southern Guangxi . The correlation between the relative soil moisture value of the ATI model and the TVDI model partition retrieval and the measured relative soil moisture data is higher, and the relative soil moisture retrieval effects is better.

TI  - Soil nutrient information system ({Snis}) in middle indo-gangetic plain of {Bihar}, {India} â€“ {A} tool for land use planning
VL  - 68
SN  - NA
AB  - In the present endeavour, an attempt has been made to develop a village level soil nutrient information system (SNIS) in Piprakothi block of East Champaran district, Bihar representing the Middle Indo-Gangetic Plains of India. Geographic information system (GIS) based grid sampling was done in the block at 2.5 ha interval and nutrient index value (NIV) of each and every grid soil samples were determined. Moderate to strong alkalinity of soils coupled with deficiency of available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) are the main soil fertility constraints of the block. Correlation studies showed significant positive relationship of organic carbon (OC) with available N (r = 0.63**), K (r = 0.58**), S (r = 040*), Zn (r = 0.39*), Fe (r = 0.58**) and B (r = 0.34*) indicating the role of soil organic matter towards soil fertility. The NIV and pH based risk zones were developed in the block by giving weightage followed by developing decision trees. The villages namely, Chand saraia, Dhekaha, Kazipur, Majharia and Piprakothi were identified under high risk zone with constraints of low NIV, whereas, Babhnaulia, Belwatia, Jiwdhara and Serma were marked under high pH risk zones. Villages with similar sets of soil fertility characteristics were grouped using hierarchical clustering towards pertaining varying management strategies. Â© 2020, Indian journals.

TI  - Generating high-resolution daily soil moisture by using spatial downscaling techniques: a comparison of six machine learning algorithms
VL  - 141
SN  - NA
AB  - Tremendous efforts have been made for obtaining surface soil moisture (SM) at high spatial resolutions from microwave-based products via spatial downscaling. In recent years, machine learning has been one of the most advanced techniques in SM spatial downscaling. The performance of a machine learning technique in SM spatial downscaling varies with the algorithm and the underlying surface; however, despite the importance of machine learning for SM downscaling, there are still only few inter-comparisons, particularly over different surfaces. In this study, the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms in downscaling the ECV (the Essential Climate Variable Program initiated by the European Space Agency) SM dataset was validated over different underlying surfaces. Six machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian (BAYE), classification and regression trees (CART), K nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were implemented to establish the spatial downscaling models with reliable continuous in-situ SM observations over four case study areas, including the Okalahoma Mesonet (OKM) in North America, Naqu network (NAN) in the Tibetan Plateau, REMEDHUS (REM) network in northeast Spain, and OZNNET (OZN) in southeast Australia. The land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), albedo, digital elevation model (DEM), and geographic coordinates were the explanatory variables, and their contributions to the downscaling models over different surfaces were quantified. The conclusions of the experiments can be summarized as follows: (1) The RF achieved excellent performance with a high correlation coefficient and a low regression error. The BAYE and KNN also demonstrated favorable capabilities for SM downscaling; however, the robustness of their algorithms needed further improvements. Numerous abnormal values were obtained in the scale-down process by the ANN, CART, and SVM methods, suggesting their comparative inadequacy in SM downscaling. (2) Downscaled 1-km resolution SM in REM generally presented a close correlation with the in-situ measurements, and its bias was larger than that in the other three regions. Comparatively, the smallest bias with the second highest correlation was found in the OZN region. It was primarily deduced that regions that located in one single climate zone and had mild topography variation and medium vegetation coverage tended to produce high-accuracy results. (3) The feature importance index (FII) calculated by the RF model revealed that the DEM, daytime LST, and NDVI were dominant during reconstruction, particularly DEM in a study region with a large height difference. The specific FII of each independent variable varied remarkably across the different case study areas, probably owing to the complex hydrothermal as well as physical geography conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that the RF model outperforms the other models considered herein; furthermore, the effect of the FII of the variables over different underlying surfaces was demonstrated.

AB  - In this paper, through the sampling analysis, the entropy weight - -fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was adopted to distribute the weight of added cultivated land fertility in Yaozhou District, Tongchuan City, and the soil fertility in the region was further evaluated. At the same time, the main limiting factor impacting soil fertility of the added cultivated land was put forward. The results indicate that 1) Indicators of soil fertility weight of newly-increased farmland in Yaozhou District, Tongchuan City Land Remediation Project is 0.3227 for organic matter, 0.1611 for total nitrogen, 0.2319 for available phosphorus, and 0.2843 for available potassium.2) The soil fertility scores of these farmland in Yaozhou District, Tongchuan City under the land consolidation project are dispersed with values ranging from 17.3 to 50.0 points, with the mean of 26.2 points. 3) Soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic matter (SOM) are the major factors behind low soil fertility indexes. The extent of their impact on soil fertility is ranked as follows: TN{\textgreater}SOM. 4) TN and SOM are the most important constraints which lead to low soil fertility of new farmland. The most effective way to improve the composite index of soil fertility is that the content of TN and SOM in the soil should be increased successively. 5) The adoption of a combination of Analytic Hierarchy Process and weight comparison method has yielded good results in evaluating soil fertility, which implies broad prospect of application.

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Drought is one of the frequent natural disasters in Shandong province, which is characterized by high frequency and wide range. In response to frequent droughts that are not monitored in time, monitoring the changes of drought is of great significance to agricultural production and social development. This study used the Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI) model, combined with the optical MODIS land surface temperature, vegetation index, surface albedo data and microwave FY-3B soil moisture data, to monitor the drought of Shandong province in 2016. The precipitation and temperature data of weather station were used to validate the monitoring results. The results show that, in 2016, the drought in Shandong province mainly occurred in winter and spring, and the drought in summer was alleviated. From the perspective of space, the northern Shandong and the Shandong peninsula areas are relatively humid with less drought time, while the local areas in the central and southern Shandong province suffer from severe drought with longer drought time. From the perspective of correlation with meteorological factors, the average correlation coefficient between TVMDI and precipitation can reach 0.45, and the average correlation coefficient between TVMDI and temperature can reach 0.63.

TI  - Prediction of soil nutrients based on topographic factors and remote sensing index in a coal mining area, {China
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - (1) Background: Coal mining operations caused severe land subsidence and altered the distributions of soil nutrients that influenced by multiple environmental factors at different scales. However, the prediction performances for soil nutrients based on their scale-specific relationships with influencing factors remains undefined in the coal mining area. The objective of this study was to establish prediction models of soil nutrients based on their scale-specific relationships with influencing factors in a coal mining area. (2) Methods: Soil samples were collected based on a 1 x 1 km regular grid, and contents of soil organic matter, soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus, and soil available potassium were measured. The scale components of soil nutrients and the influencing factors collected from remote sensing and topographic factors were decomposed by two-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (2D-EMD), and the predictions for soil nutrients were established using the methods of multiple linear stepwise regression or partial least squares regression based on original samples (MLSROri or PLSROri), partial least squares regression based on bi-dimensional intrinsic mode function (PLSRBIMF), and the combined method of 2D-EMD, PLSR, and MLSR (2D-EMDPM). (3) Results: The correlation types and correlation coefficients between soil nutrients and influencing factors were scale-dependent. The variances of soil nutrients at smaller scale were stochastic and non-significantly correlated with influencing factors, while their variances at the larger scales were stable. The prediction performances in the coal mining area were better than those in the non-coal mining area, and 2D-EMDPM had the most stable performance. (4) Conclusions: The scale-dependent predictions can be used for soil nutrients in the coal mining areas. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The estimation of soil moisture using {DUBOIS} model (1995) for monitoring phase growth of paddy
VL  - 500
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring the growth of rice in Indonesia is very important because rice is a staple food of the Indonesian people. The biggest rice producer in West Java is Indramayu. Soil moisture is one of factor in monitoring the growth of paddy. The Monitoring is carried out using SAR image, namely Radarsat-2 Quad-Polarimetric imagery. In estimating the value of soil moisture, required a dielectric constant which is obtained from the value of the Digital Number (DN) that is converted into the backscattering value (Ïƒo). The approach that used in calculating the dielectric constant is a semi-empirical approach using the Dubois model (1995). The purpose of this study is to estimate the value of soil moisture in order that it can be used in monitoring the growth phase of paddy. The rice growth phase is distinguished in the form of a graph subsequently matched with the results of field photo validation. The results of this research show a positive linear correlation between the Dubois model (1995) and field soil moisture with a level of accuracy of Â± 7.202\% volumetric. Â© 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Labile fractions of soil nutrients shape the distribution of bacterial communities towards phosphorus recycling systems over elevation gradients in {Gongga} {Mountain}, {SW} {China
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - Bacterial communities are major participant in the alpine biogeochemical phosphorus (P) cycle. However, shifts in the main bacteria towards phosphorus recycling systems (BPRS) over elevation gradients and their driving factors are poorly understood. In this work, BPRS were associated with bacterial sequences according to Illumina sequencing and a published dataset of BPRS orders. BPRS communities over an altitudinal gradient from 3000 to 4300 m were investigated. The results showed that BPRS communities were dominated by Acidobacteriales, Rhizobiales, Solibacterales, Xanthomonadales, and Actinomycetales, and the BCPRS groups accounted for 32â€“61\% of all the bacterial sequences. Most of the BPRS communities showed different distribution trends with increasing elevation, including increasing, hump-backed and hollow trends. The total BPRS composition showed significant clustering in relation to the vegetation landscape. Compared with the total amount of soil nutrients (TOC, TN and TP), the labile fractions of these nutrients played a more important role in shaping the distribution patterns of BPRS communities. Moreover, our results suggest that soil C availability wields much influence on the BPRS communities by enhancing the availability of soil N and P. The most likely explanation for this conclusion is that the labile C fractions (representing soil C availability) provided the energy and C feedstock for synthesis of enzymes related to N and P mineralization to lead to enhance the availability of soil N and P. Our study highlight that the labile fractions of soil nutrients are substantive factors controlling the elevational distribution of BPRS communities over elevation gradients in Gongga Mountain, SW China.

TI  - Distribution of soil nutrients and enzyme activities in different aggregates under two sieving methods
VL  - 84
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil aggregates are the basic units of soil structure. Dry and wet sieving are two conventional methods used for isolating aggregates. However, different methods can cause variation in the distribution of enzymes and nutrients. For better understanding the influence of water on soil aggregate stability and building the relationship between soil nutrients and the enzyme activity of aggregates, three soil samples with different organic matter (OM) content were selected: Qiyang, Hunan (HN); Hailun, Heilongjiang (HLJ); and Changshu, Jiangsu (JS). In this study, we measured the enzyme activity of invertase (INV), urease (URE), phosphatase (PHO), and arylsulfatase (ARY) together the OM, total N (TN), available N (AN), available P, and available K of dry and wet sieved aggregates. The results showed that wet sieving caused 34.0, 66.8, and 35.1\% decreases in the soil mean weight diameter for HN, HLJ, and JS, respectively. The TN content of wet sieved aggregates decreased to various degrees (19.9â€“47.7\%) compared with dry sieving. The activity of INV, PHO, and ARY decreased sharply after wet sieving especially for microaggregates (reached 70\% in {\textless}0.1-mm particles of JS). Enzyme activities were mainly located in microaggregates under dry isolation but changed to macroaggregates after wet sieving. The geometric mean (GMean) index of {\textless}0.1-mm particles were 1.54, 1.01 and 1.36 times higher than that of {\textgreater}2-mm aggregates under dry sieving. Furthermore, the GMean index showed a significant positive relationship with soil OM, TN, and AN under both dry and wet sieving methods. Â© 2019 The Authors.

TI  - New empirical equation to estimate the soil moisture content based on thermal properties using machine learning techniques
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Information about soil moisture content is crucial for the sustenance of agricultural system because it helps to make decision on irrigation scheduling and water management. However, the conventional procedures for determining the soil moisture content need much effort, and time-consuming with large dataset. It is known that soil thermal properties have significant influence on the moisture content of soil. Therefore, the soil moisture content can be determined based on the soil thermal properties, which can easily be measured with portable equipment known as KD2 Pro. This study presents an alternative technique for estimating the soil moisture content from thermal properties using machine learning (ML). Actual measurements of moisture contents and thermal properties at seventy-five points were used. Three ML techniques including artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to predict the moisture content of soil from its thermal properties (thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat). The results show that all the three techniques (ANN, FL, and SVM) were able to predict moisture content with acceptable errors where the average absolute error is around 5.65\%. Moreover, a new empirical equation is presented to allow quick estimation of the moisture content. Ultimately, the developed models can be employed to predict the soil moisture content in any farmland with known thermal properties, which will lead to cost reduction and less time and effort to determine soil moisture content.

TI  - Effect of conservation agriculture and nutrient management options on soil phosphorus fractions under maize-wheat cropping system
VL  - 68
SN  - NA
AB  - With increasing adoption of conservation agriculture (CA), understanding of the impact of tillage, and residue retention and nutrient management options on the transformation of soil phosphorus (P) will give a brief idea of the extent of bioavailability of the different fractions, as low P availability in soil limits crop production. Thus, transformation and bioavailability of P through sequential fractionation was studied (0-5 and 5-15 cm) in maize-wheat cropping system with treatments consisting of four levels of tillage and residue regime (TR) as main plots i.e. conventional tillage (CT-RR); conventional tillage with residue incorporation (CT+RI+GI), maize and wheat on permanent beds with residue retention (PB+RR) and maize, wheat and green gram on permanent beds with residue retention (PB+RR+GR), and three nutrient management (NM) options in sub-plots i.e. farmerâ€™s fertilizer practice (FFP); recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) and site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) in a split-plot design with three replications. Results showed that PB+RR+GR resulted in highest soil microbial biomass P (SMBP), Olsen-P, labile and moderately labile-P content amongst TR systems at 0-5 and 5-15 cm depths. The TR systems influenced the HCl-P but not the residual-P and total-P. Complete CA significantly increased total organic P (TPo) by 6.28\% in the top 5 cm layer. Among the NM options, highest SMBP, Olsen P and labile P were registered under SSNM. The mean distribution of P fractions was: residual-P (32.1\%) {\textgreater} HCl-P (27.8\%) {\textgreater} NaOH-Po (22.2\%) {\textgreater} NaHCO3-Po (9.06\%) {\textgreater} NaOH-Pi (6.28\%) {\textgreater} NaHCO3-Pi (1.39\%) {\textgreater} water soluble P (WSP) (1.11\%). The WSP was positively correlated with NaHCO3-Pi, NaHCO3-Po, NaOH-Po and TPo in both soil layers. Olsen P and SMBP were also positively correlated with labile P and NaOH-Po. The study showed that nutrient applied through SSNM approach rather than blanket recommendation enhanced the labile and available P in soil under CA. Â© 2020, Indian journals. All rights reserved.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic development of our country. Crop yield primarily depends on soil fertility and moisture level. Fertilizers are normally recommended based on the nutrient present in the soil. To recommend a suitable fertilizer level, the soil nutrient analysis is essential which is done mostly using laboratory techniques. Manual methods of measuring soil nutrients are time consuming. Many farmers refrain to perform soil testing in the laboratory and grow the same crop in the land continuously, hence soil loses its fertility. A system has been proposed to adopt precision agriculture using Wireless Sensor Networks, which enables remote monitoring of soil fertility and other parameters namely soil moisture, pH and temperature. This data is transmitted to the cloud and the corresponding values are displayed on a mobile application. The proposed Internet of things (IoT) based software system has the intelligence to recommend the quantity of water and fertilizer which improves the quality of the soil and ensures optimum growth of the crop.

AB  - Findings from the investigations on the effects of different soil nutrient managements and cooking methods on nutrient and phytochemical composition of orange-fleshed sweet potato (Umudike Sweet Potato Variety 3) (UMUSPO 3 Ipomea batatas) are reported in this article. UMUSPO 3 potato vines (main plot) were planted on eight sub- plots treated with different soil nutrients (Poultry manure, agrolyser and NPK) combinations (VB1 - VB8) and a control (VB9) at the National Root Crops Research Institute experimental farm, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria. Potato tubers were harvested after 4 months of planting and both cooked and raw samples were subjected to chemical and sensory analysis. Carbohydrate and dry matter contents were highest and respectively 16.4\% and 29.79\% in potatoes harvested from the control soil (VB9). Both control and treated soils yielded potatoes that were high in calcium (86.94 - 96.47 mg/100g), magnesium (73.62 - 86.87 mg/100g), phosphorus (151.26 - 195.97 mg/100g), potassium (790.30 - 901.54 mg/100g) and sodium (74.50 - 81.84 mg/100g). Only soil treatments with NPK 15:15:15 at 400 kg/ha (VB5) improved protein contents of raw potatoes from 5.26\% to 6.13\% while other soil treatments decreased the protein content. Potato harvested from the control and various soil treatments (VB1 -VB8) were rich in vitamin C (53.34 - 95.37 mg/100 g) and carotene (28.52 - 29.73 mg/100 g) but relatively low in the B vitamins. Soil treatments VB1 to VB8 did not improve vitamin contents of potatoes beyond that of the control for vitamin B1. Cooking methods and cooking time affected carotenoid retention in UMUSPO 3 potato. Carotenoid retention was higher in oven-dried samples than in roasted and boiled samples. Oven-drying for 24h decreased total carotenoid retention to 76.4\%, and for 48h to 36.3\%. Boiling for 10 min decreased carotenoid content to 56.4\%, and for 30 min to 17.1\%. Roasting for 10 min reduced it to 50.6\%, and for 30 min to 30.9\%. Â© 2020. All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - The effects of organic (manure, cover crop) and mineral fertilisers on total yield, soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) dynamics and soil pH changes were studied over 10 years. Five field crops (spring barley, red clover, winter wheat, field pea, potato) were grown organically and conventionally in rotation. The total yield of the five crops fertilized similarly was 24â€“25\% higher in conventionally fertilised treatments than in organic treatments. The higher yielding conventionally fertilised treatments (annual total yield 29.0â€“29.8 t haâ€“1) removed 12â€“18 kg haâ€“1 P and 45â€“73 kg haâ€“1 K per year, which was respectively 28â€“35\% and 28â€“40\% higher than organic treatments. The soil became more acidic in the conventional system (pH 5.4â€“5.9 versus 5.9-6.3). The highest annual P and K uptake was by potato, followed by winter wheat. Use of winter cover crops and composted cattle manure in the organic system did not maintain the levels of P and K in the soil at baseline. Â© 2020, The Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland.

TI  - Effect of fertilizer and manure application on soil organic carbon sequestration, soil fertility and yield sustainability under maize-wheat cropping system in subtropical mollisols
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - A field experiment with nine treatments was initiated in 2014 on a Mollisol to study the effect of fertilizers (NPK) and farmyard manure (FYM) application with or without Azotobector or Zinc on yields, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and sequestration and soil properties in maize-wheat rotation. After four years it was revealed that continuous application of 100\% recommended dose of NPK+ FYM @ 5 t ha-1 recorded significantly higher grain yields of maize and wheat and N, P, and K removal by the system. Crops yield increased by 100\% NPK alone or combined with FYM or Zn in the fourth year compared to the first year. Intercropping of cowpea with maize caused a reduction in maize yield but its residual effect enhanced wheat yield. Bulk density of surface soil reduced significantly from 1.4-4.3\% over initial except in control and 50\% NPK. Available N, P, K, and Zn increased under integrated use of NPK fertilizer and FYM or Zn but decreased more in control. Response to the application of 100\% NPK was maximum to the tune of 1.31 t ha-1 for maize and 1.34 t ha-1 for wheat whereas least with cowpea intercropping. SOC content and storage/pool in the surface soil increased from 0.7-7.2\% and 0.5-2.9\%, respectively, in FYM applied plots over the initial level. Application of FYM @ 10 t ha + Azotobacter in cowpea intercropping sequestrated maximum SOC (0.14 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) but reduced yields of maize and wheat. Grain yield of maize rather than wheat was more closely correlated with SOC content and storage. Results suggested that continuous application of 100\% NPK along with FYM @ 5 t ha-1 led to better soil fertility and yield sustainability.

TI  - Changes in land use systems alter the phosphorus nutrition and associated soil fertility status
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Improved plant nutrition to get high productivity is under severe influence of human activities drastically impacting the soil-plant ecosystem. In the scenario of increased global socio-economic demand for food, the changes in land use systems to gain higher agricultural productivity are disrupting the soil properties as well as the associated soil services. This work investigated the impact of different land use systems on phosphorus (P) and associated soil nutrients including K, Ca and Mg across six different land use systems in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Phosphorous fractions were determined by the modified sequential extraction procedures and the concentration of nutrients was measured by double acid digestion. Results revealed the significant variations across different land use systems for P where different P fractions were found considerably varying in order of HCL{\textgreater}NaOH{\textgreater}NaHCO3 {\textgreater}H2 O extractable phosphorus. Interestingly, nutrients were found to be varying from thick forest to cultivated lands. Results demonstrate that the shift from the thick forests to thin forests or arable lands may increase the P losses and ultimately disturb the associated soil-plant nutrient status thus should remain intact to promote the plant productivity in a sustainable way.

TI  - Inversion of soil water content in jiyang district based on high resolution remote sensing image
VL  - 428
SN  - NA
AB  - The monitoring of soil water content plays an important role in agricultural production. This paper uses high resolution remote sensing image (GF-2 image) and measured soil water content data combined with dual-band, multi-band and PDI index inversion models to invert the soil water content of Xiyan and Wangxingjia Village of Jiyang District, Jinan City, and the effects of soil water content inversion were compared and verified. The results show that the decision coefficients of the multi-band inversion model reach 0.690, respectively, with the highest accuracy. More than 90\% of the area in this study area has a soil water content greater than 0.15, which is dominated by suitable and wet soils, mainly distributed in the central part of the study area and near water bodies such as paddy fields, pit ponds and ditches; heavy drought, moderate drought, Light and dry soils account for a very small number, mainly distributed in the southwest direction of the study area, that is, the west side of Wangxingjia Village, distributed in a strip shape. It can be seen that GF-2 images can carry out the inversion of large-scale soil water content and provide a basis for scientific decision-making of agricultural production.

TI  - A novel low-cost conductivity based soil moisture sensor
VL  - 1103 AISC
SN  - NA
AB  - Water management for irrigation purposes is especially decisive in places prone to droughts because soil moisture sensors are economically unattainable for farmers. The sustainable usage of water should not be restricted by the elevated price of the system. In this paper, we present a low-cost sensor for the monitoring of soil moisture, which can be part of a smart irrigation system. The sensor is composed of two coils, one is powered with alternate current and the other one is used to measure the induced voltage. It is based on conductivity and uses the method of mutual inductance. We study five prototypes, which have different numbers of turns in each coil. We compare them in order to determine the best model. The best sensor is the one that consists of one coil with 40 turns (which is powered) and one with 100 turns (which is induced). The best frequency is 260 kHz, the coil is induced with 10 peak to peak voltage and the induced voltage, which is measured with an oscilloscope, changes with the soil moisture. At this frequency, the sensor presents the biggest difference in volts. The differences are 1.2 V between 0 and 6\% of water volume in the soil; 0.8 between 6 and 8\% water volume in the soil; and 1.6 V between 8 and 17\% of water volume in soil. Considering these differences, we can safely formulate an equation to extract the soil moisture values with high accuracy. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

TI  - Integrated soil fertility and yield trend in response to long-term fertilisation under the chinese double rice-cropping systems
VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility is fundamental in determining crop productivity and sustainability in farming systems. A long-term fertiliser experiment in Chinese double rice-cropping systems initiated in 2011 was used in this study to gain an insight into a complete estimating of soil fertility. The six fertiliser treatments included mineral fertiliser (NP, NK, and NPK), combined NPK with farmyard manure (NPKM) or crop straw (NPKS), and no fertiliser application as a control. Results showed that grain yield averaged 5.5â€“13.0 t/ha/year, and significant increasing trends were observed in the phosphorus-applied plots (NP, NPK, NPKM, and NPKS), but the treatments without phosphorus applied (control and NK) resulted in declining trends in both early-and late-rice yields. After long-term rice cultivation, the contents of total and available phosphorus significantly declined in phosphorus-deficient plots compared to other treatments. Regression analysis showed that the improvement in grain yields was positively correlated with the increased soil fertility over treatments. Relative to the NPK treatment, the NPKM treatment greatly enhanced soil fertility from 0.50 to 0.78, and particularly dramatically increased the content of available soil phosphorus. Therefore, the high grain yield and soil fertility can be simultaneously achieved by long-term balanced fertiliser applications in Chinese double rice-cropping systems.

AB  - Modern technologies of winter wheat growing need to be improved taking into account the results of ecological evaluation of their impact on soil fertility indices. We aimed to assess the technologies of winter wheat growing in different soil and climatic conditions of Ukraine by their influence on soil fertility. It is known that in order to estimate ecological safety of crop growing technologies, it is advisable to use a method based on identifying negative impacts on soil fertility. We propose the group of deviation values from the optimum as follows: (i) strong, which leads to an unsatisfactory ecological condition ({\textgreater} 50 \%), (ii) average that provides a satisfactory state ({\textgreater} 25 \%, but {\textless} 50 \%), (iii) moderate, which provides a normal state (â‰¤ 10 \%, but {\textless} 25 \%), (iv) absent, an optimal condition is provided ({\textless} 10 \%). It is revealed that technologies of winter wheat growing in the conditions of Polissya, Forest-steppe and Steppe Zones of Ukraine can have a negative influence on potassium regime in soils, the influence by intensity can vary from moderate to strong. In Polissya and Forest-steppe, winter wheat growing can lead to deterioration of soil pH status. In Steppe, along with the potassium regime, the technologies can negatively influence soil nitrogen status and the effect may be characterized as strong. Â© 2020 University of Ljubljana.

TI  - Conductive polymer-based sensor for soil nutrient detection
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - To increase the production of crops, chemical fertilizers are used in crop fields. However, underuse or overuse cannot increase crop yields but even decrease them and cause severe environmental problems. Thus, the detection and monitoring of chemical concentration are increasingly important. To build up and monitor a data-based system for a large area, such a method is costly and time-consuming. In this research, we developed a conductive polymer-based sensor to detect nitrate concentrations in soil water. Conducting polymer poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT) was used as our sensing material. To increase its conductivity, we used the vacuum phase polymerization method to achieve a high conductive and stable polymer film. The conductivity of the polymer film is 500 S/cm. Our results have demonstrated that the conductive polymer-based sensors have high sensitivity to nitrate solution. The response to 1000 ppm nitrate solution is 47.2\% (Response = (Initrate - IDIwate) / IDIwater). The sensors can detect nitrate range from 1ppm to 1000 ppm. The response time is less than 1 minute. This impedance-based sensor will eventually be integrated with the surface acoustic wave sensors, combined with an antenna and a GPR unit for low maintenance, autonomous, and in-situ soil nutrient sensing.

TI  - Evaluation of soil moisture sensing technologies in silt loam and loamy sand soils: {Assessment} of performance, temperature sensitivity, and site- {And} sensor-specific calibration functions
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - Reliable soil moisture information is vital for optimal irrigation management, farm-level agronomic decisionmaking, hydrologic studies, and cropping systems modeling. A wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies is commercially available, but their performance must be evaluated for diverse conditions of use. In this research, we investigated nine soil moisture sensors based on time-domain reflectometry, capacitance, and electrical resistance principles in production field conditions with two installation orientations, i.e., vertical (V) and horizontal (H), in two soils (silt loam and loamy sand) and two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Performance parameters deduced from the 2017 datasets revealed that sensor type and soil type significantly affected the soil moisture sensor performance under factory calibration (F.C.); however, sensor installation orientation did not. Thus, the sensors were only evaluated based on their performance in horizontal orientation in both soils. Precision and accuracy were considered targets to assist in appropriate sensor selection. To improve sensor accuracy, site-specific calibration (S.S.C.) functions were developed and validated using independent datasets from 2018. Considering mean bias error (MBE), all sensors overestimated volumetric soil water content ( Î¸v) in both soils, with the exception of TEROS 21 (MPS-6) in silt loam and JD probe in loamy sand. On average, sensor performance was 67\% better in loamy sand than in silt loam. Overall, the sensors showed higher precision in silt loam (R2 = 0.53 to 0.93) than in loamy sand (R2 = 0.25 to 0.82). Substantial post-S.S.C. improvement (32\% to 89\%) was observed in all sensors' performance relative to F.C. in silt loam. In loamy sand, while most sensors performed reasonably well with F.C., considerable improvements (28\% to 85\%) were observed with S.S.C. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed in sensors' sensitivity to soil temperature (Tsoil), which ranged from 14Â°C to 23Â°C in silt loam and from 14Â°C to 25Â°C loamy sand during the experiments. The CS655, 10HS, 5TE, and TEROS 21 (MPS-6) sensors showed significant (p {\textless} 0.05) sensitivity to Tsoil fluctuations, with Tsoil explaining a maximum of 17\% of the variance observed in sensor performance. No statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) sensitivity was detected for any of the sensors in loamy sand. TEROS 21 (MPS-6) had the highest sensitivity to Tsoil with a slope of -4.25. In contrast, while statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05), 5TE was the least sensitive to Tsoil variability with a slope of 1.81. The information, data, and analyses presented here can be instrumental for informed sensor selection and use in decision-making in production fields with similar soil textures and soil water regimes.

VL  - 580
SN  - NA
AB  - This study attempted to develop a point-surface collaborative inversion (PSCI) method for the estimation of regional surface soil moisture (SSM) using a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) trained on sparse ground-based measurements. Specifically, GRNN was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between ground-based measurements from sparse network stations (SNSs) and passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in the continental U.S. for April 2015 to March 2018. More importantly, the extended triple collocation (ETC) technique was applied to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of ground-based measurements, whereby individual SNSsâ€™ reliability at the SMAP coarse footprint scale could be determined before fed into GRNN. The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the GRNN model trained on reliable SNSs obtained a satisfactory performanceâ€”the cross-validated R and unbiased RMSE values were 0.88 and 0.050 cm3 cmâˆ’3, respectively, which outperformed the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and the other GRNN model trained on all SNSs. Furthermore, temporal and spatial comparisons between the PSCI-based SSM retrievals and other SSM datasets indicated the former agreed the best with ground measurements both in time and space, suggesting the proposed PSCI method had shown great potential in estimating reliable regional SSM climate records.

TI  - Comparison of paddy soil fertility under conventional rice straw application versus cow dung compost application in mixed cropâ€“livestock systems in a cold temperate region of {Japan
VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - After the rice harvest in Japan, rice straw (RS) is usually cut by combine harvester and incorporated into the soil to improve its fertility. In mixed cropâ€“livestock systems, however, RS is collected and used as livestock feed, and cow dung compost (CDC) is then applied to the soil. This system utilizes the residual organic matter from both rice production and livestock husbandry to make each product. CDC application is also considered to improve the fertility of paddy soil. However, the nutrient input from CDC and the effect of CDC application on soil fertility vary among regions and/or soil types. We compared soil fertility between RS application (RS treatment, avg. 32 years) and RS removal plus CDC application (CDC treatment, avg. 21 years) in 79 paddy fields in Mamurogawa town, Yamagata Prefecture, a cold temperate region of Japan, and measured the nutrient contents in the applied RS and CDC. The total C content of RS was significantly higher than that of CDC, whereas the N, P, K, and Si contents of CDC were significantly higher than those of RS. However, there was no significant difference in paddy soil fertilityâ€“as measured by soil organic C, total N, CEC, available N, P, and Si, exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg, base saturation percentage, pH, and bulk densityâ€“between the treatments. The soil fertility of most fields was adequate by RS or CDC treatment. Thus, leaving RS in paddy fields or removing it and then adding CDC to the paddy fields has a similar effect in maintaining adequate soil fertility for single rice production or riceâ€“livestock production systems.

TI  - Mulching effects on soil nutrient levels and yield in coffee farming systems in {Rwanda
VL  - 36
SN  - NA
AB  - Different combinations of organic mulch were applied in smallholder coffee farming systems to assess their effects on soil nutrient contents and coffee yield at three sites in different agro-ecological zones in Rwanda. Mulching systems consisted of Cymbopogon spp. (T1), Panicum spp. (T2), Cymbopogon spp. and Panicum spp. (T3), Eucalyptus spp. and Cymbopogon spp. (T4), mixed residues (T5) and un-mulched coffee used as control (T6). Mulch had significant and specific effects at each site (p {\textless} 0.001). T3 reduced soil pH value and exchangeable acidity at Kibirizi, while at Karongi and Ruli, these effects were observed with T4 and T5. T4 and T5 significantly increased the content of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). The amount of nutrients released was regulated by the amount and type of mulch applied, the agro-ecological conditions and the soil properties at each site. The increased soil nutrient levels led to improved soil fertility conditions and increased coffee yields. The coffee yields were significantly increased with T1 at Karongi (p {\textless} 0.05) by up to 1.9 t haâˆ’1. T2 and T3 had significantly higher yields at Kibirizi. Yields at Kibirizi were 48\% lower compared to yields at Karongi; at this site, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 increased yields by 57\%, 26\%, 31\%, 20\% and 28\%, respectively, when compared to the no mulching treatment (T6). However, coffee yields over 1.9 t haâˆ’1 can only be obtained with additional applications of inorganic fertilizer at different rates depending on the agro-ecological zone and soil type.

TI  - A {Low}-cost {Soil} {Moisture} {Monitoring} {Method} by {Using} {Walabot} and {Machine} {Learning} {Algorithms
VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in agricultural processes, which has a significant effect on crop evapotranspiration, the exchange of water, and energy fluxes. Recently, soil moisture can be measured by remote sensing or proximate sensing techniques, such as thermal, optical, and microwave measurements. However, there are limitations to the applications of these methods, such as low spatial resolution, limited surface penetration, and vegetation. In this study, it proposed a new low-cost soil moisture monitoring method by using a Walabot sensor and machine learning algorithms. Walabot is a pocket-sized device cutting-edge technology for Radio Frequency tridimensional sensing. Unlike the remote sensing tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) limited by cloud cover or payload capability, the Walabot can be used flexibly in the field and provide data information more promptly and accurately than UAVs or satellite. By putting different moisture levels of soil on the Walabot, the Walabot can collect radio frequency reflectance data from different levels of soil moisture. Then, machine learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), have been applied for data processing. Results showed that Walabot has a state-of-art performance in estimating soil moisture. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Laboratory calibration and performance evaluation of low-cost capacitive and very low-cost resistive soil moisture sensors
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil volumetric water content (VWC) is a vital parameter to understand several ecohydrological and environmental processes. Its cost-effective measurement can potentially drive various technological tools to promote data-driven sustainable agriculture through supplemental irrigation solutions, the lack of which has contributed to severe agricultural distress, particularly for smallholder farmers. The cost of commercially available VWC sensors varies over four orders of magnitude. A laboratory study characterizing and testing sensors from this wide range of cost categories, which is a prerequisite to explore their applicability for irrigation management, has not been conducted. Within this context, two low-cost capacitive sensorsâ€”SMEC300 and SM100â€”manufactured by Spectrum Technologies Inc. (Aurora, IL, USA), and two very low-cost resistive sensorsâ€”the Soil Hygrometer Detection Module Soil Moisture Sensor (YL100) by Electronicfans and the Generic Soil Moisture Sensor Module (YL69) by KitsGuruâ€”were tested for performance in laboratory conditions. Each sensor was calibrated in different repacked soils, and tested to evaluate accuracy, precision and sensitivity to variations in temperature and salinity. The capacitive sensors were additionally tested for their performance in liquids of known dielectric constants, and a comparative analysis of the calibration equations developed in-house and provided by the manufacturer was carried out. The value for money of the sensors is reflected in their precision performance, i.e., the precision performance largely follows sensor costs. The other aspects of sensor performance do not necessarily follow sensor costs. The low-cost capacitive sensors were more accurate than manufacturer specifications, and could match the performance of the secondary standard sensor, after soil specific calibration. SMEC300 is accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 2.12\%, 2.88\% and 0.28 respectively), precise, and performed well considering its price as well as multi-purpose sensing capabilities. The less-expensive SM100 sensor had a better accuracy (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 1.67\%, 2.36\% and 0.21 respectively) but poorer precision than the SMEC300. However, it was established as a robust, field ready, low-cost sensor due to its more consistent performance in soils (particularly the field soil) and superior performance in fluids. Both the capacitive sensors responded reasonably to variations in temperature and salinity conditions. Though the resistive sensors were less accurate and precise compared to the capacitive sensors, they performed well considering their cost category. The YL100 was more accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 3.51\%, 5.21\% and 0.37 respectively) than YL69 (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 4.13\%, 5.54\%, and 0.41, respectively). However, YL69 outperformed YL100 in terms of precision, and response to temperature and salinity variations, to emerge as a more robust resistive sensor. These very low-cost sensors may be used in combination with more accurate sensors to better characterize the spatiotemporal variability of field scale soil moisture. The laboratory characterization conducted in this study is a prerequisite to estimate the effect of low-and very low-cost sensor measurements on the efficiency of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems.

TI  - Rice straw biochar improves soil fertility, growth, and yield of riceâ€“wheat system on a sandy loam soil
VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Biochar has received attention due to its potential for mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration in soil and improving soil quality and crop productivity. This study evaluated the effects of rice straw biochar (RSB) and rice husk ash (RHA) each applied at 5 Mg haâˆ’1 and four N levels (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg haâˆ’1) on soil fertility, growth, and yield of rice and wheat for three consecutive riceâ€“wheat rotations. RSB significantly increased electrical conductivity, dehydrogenase activity, and P and K contents when compared to control (no amendment) up to 7.5 cm soil depth. Both RSB and RHA did not influence shoot N concentration in wheat plant but significantly increased P and K concentrations at 60 days after sowing. Grain yields of both rice and wheat were significantly higher in RSB as compared to control (no amendment) and RHA treatments. While the highest grain yields of rice and wheat were observed at 120 kg N haâˆ’1 in RHA and no biochar-treated plots, a significant increase in grain yields was observed at 80 kg N haâˆ’1 in RSB treatment, thereby saving 40 kg N haâˆ’1 in each crop. Both agronomic and recovery N efficiencies in rice and wheat were significantly higher in RSB-amended soil compared to control. Significant positive correlations were observed between soil N, P, and K concentrations and total N, P, and K concentrations in aboveground biomass of wheat at 60 days after sowing. This study showed the potential benefits of applying RSB for improving soil fertility and yields of rice and wheat in a riceâ€“wheat system. Â© Cambridge University Press 2019.

TI  - Multivariate data assimilation of {GRACE}, {SMOS}, {SMAP} measurements for improved regional soil moisture and groundwater storage estimates
VL  - 135
SN  - NA
AB  - Assimilating remote sensing observations into land surface models has become common practice to improve the accuracy of terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates such as soil moisture and groundwater, for understanding the land surface interaction with the climate system, as well as assessing regional and global water resources. Such remote sensing observations include soil moisture information from the L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, and TWS information from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE). This study evaluates the benefit of assimilating them into the Community Atmosphere and Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model. The evaluation is conducted in the Goulburn River catchment, South-East Australia, where various in situ soil moisture and groundwater level data are available for validating data assimilation (DA) approaches. It is found that the performance of DA mainly depends on the type of observations that are assimilated. The SMOS/SMAP-only assimilation (SM DA) improves the top soil moisture but degrades the groundwater storage estimates, whereas the GRACE-only assimilation (GRACE DA) improves only the groundwater component. Assimilating both observations (multivariate DA) results in increased accuracy of both soil moisture and groundwater storage estimates. These findings demonstrate the added value of multivariate DA for simultaneously improving different model states, thus leading to a more robust DA system. Â© 2019

TI  - Performace analysis of simple capacitive cylinder sensor for measuring soil moisture content
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper studied the performance of a cylinder sensor on measuring the soil moisture content for an automatic irrigation supply purpose. The proposed sensor was generated from a simple capacitive cylinder made from combination of aluminium, stainles steel and pertinax to construct the outer, inner and electrode isolator, respectively, avoiding the effect of soil salinity. The objective is to determine the response of the proposed sensor in measuring the soil moisture content for various level. To measure the moisture content, the proposed sensore equipped with a stable Multivibrator (AM) circuits and Arduino Multicontrol. Changes in sensor capacitance value indicate the change in soil moisture levels, generating a signal in AM circuit, which were then converted using Arduino microcontroller and displayed on the LCD screen. The test showed that, the range value for sand samples are 78, 662 to 1, 035 Hz, while for clay are 74, 551 to 932 Hz. The regression model showed an exponential relationship between soil moisture content and the frequency of the electrical signal generated by the equation y = 123872e-0.229x with R2 equal to 0, 9127.

TI  - A linear mixed effect ({LME}) model for soil nutrients and soil salinity changes based on two localized irrigation techniques (drip irrigation and buried diffuser)
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - The sustainable management of irrigation water in arid regions poses a challenge in the face of water scarcity and climate change. This study was carried out on an arid area under greenhouse conditions. A modeling approach was used to analyze the effect of two irrigation techniques (drip irrigation and a new irrigation technique called buried diffuser) on repeated measurements of soil nutrients (organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3âˆ’-N), ammonia (NH4+-N), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK)), sodium (Na+), and electrical conductivity (EC) at different depths of the sampling sites within the root zone of a pepper crop using two irrigation treatments: T1 (100\% of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET)) and T2 (50\% of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET)). As a result, the buried diffuser system significantly improves the soil nutrient levels, especially in regard to OM, TN, NO3âˆ’-N, AP, and AK, with considerable enhancement of pepper yield for the two irrigation treatments, T1 and T2. Moreover, the buried diffuser keeps the field in better soil salinity conditions than drip irrigation. Â© 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

TI  - Fine mapping of key soil nutrient content using high resolution remote sensing image to support precision agriculture in {Northwest} {China
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The rapid development of industrialized agriculture has leads to the problems of soil pollution and water pollution. In order to solve these problems, precision agriculture (PA) has been applied to achieve precise management of agricultural water and fertilizer. In PA process, fine mapping of soil nutrient is an effective technology to acquire accurate water and fertilizer distribution information and make agricultural decision. A significant progress has been made in digital soil mapping (DSM) of soil nutrient content over the past 20 years. However, the accuracy of grid-based DSM cannot meet the practical application needs of PA. This paper proposed a fine DSM method of soil nutrient content using high resolution remote sensing images and multi-scale auxiliary data for PA application. Three key technologies were studied for the implementation of this method. The automatic extraction of fine mapping units was the basis of this method. We designed different automatic extraction methods based on high resolution remote sensing images for agricultural production units in plains and mountainous areas. The auxiliary variables in different scales were chosen and converted to construct fine-scale soil nutrient-environment relationship model. Finally, machine learning methods were used to map the spatial distribution of soil nutrients. We chose Zhongning County, Ningxia Province as the study area, which includes typical plain and mountainous agriculture. The proposed method and technologies were applied for typical soil nutrients mapping. A common grid-based spatial interpolation method was implemented with the same soil sample dataset to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. The result showed that this method could reduce the number of prediction units and effectively improve the prediction efficiency in both plain and mountainous areas for fine soil mapping and precision agriculture application. This study was an attempt to realize fine soil mapping based on PA application unit in different environments. The high-resolution remote sensing images provide basic data for the realization of this idea, and the conversion technology of multi-scale data provides better support for the spatial inference of fine soil attribute information. In the future, we will carry out experiments in larger areas to further improve the efficiency of application, and plan to expand this study to consider three-dimensional soil property prediction.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content is a key parameter in water resources management. It is important to obtain reliable soil moisture content data that being consistent in space and time for water resources management. Land surface process model and data assimilation are effective means to obtain reliable spatial and temporal continuous soil moisture content. However, the lack of real observations and dynamically updated surface parameters often greatly affect the accuracy of stimulated results of the land surface model. Based on high-resolution remote sensing data, we continuously invert vegetation coverage which is the crucial parameter of land surface process model during the study period, dynamically update it, and consider the remote sensing inversion of soil moisture content as the observation input, combined with the data assimilation algorithm to carry out model simulation and data assimilation research. We choose China's Hetao Irrigation District as the research area, use Noah LSM model and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm to build the data assimilation system, and set the land use parcels of the irrigation district as the research unit. Based on the Chinese Gaofen-1 and environmental disaster reduction satellites' remote sensing data, we retrieve the vegetation coverage fraction every ten days, and generate monthly vegetation coverage fraction data to update the Noah LSM model parameter. Meanwhile, we use the TVDI algorithm to invert the soil moisture content as the observation data in assimilation system and the simulation of the Noah LSM model. Model simulation and data assimilation experiments show that the remote sensing retrieval vegetation coverage fraction can improve the effectiveness of model simulation, which approaches to the true value, and also improves the data assimilation accuracy. The overall performance is better than that using the fixed state parameter. Â© 2019 IEEE.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - In sugarcane expansion areas where soil fertility restrictions regularly occur, soil preparing ameliorates soil physical and chemical properties to improve conditions for sugarcane crop development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate soil chemical attributes under different soil preparation methods for sugarcane cultivation at the first and second year of expansion area in the Cerrado biome. The experiment was conducted in an area previously used as pasture land for more than 10 years with Brachiaria decumbens without any soil correction. CTC-2 sugarcane variety was planted. The experiment was set up as a randomized block design with six treatments and four replications. The treatments were: desiccation-liming-plowing-harrowing; liming-plowing-harrowing; liming-harrowing-plowing-harrowing; desiccation-liming-direct planting; desiccation-liming-subsoiling, and harrowing-liming-plowing-harrowing. Soil attributes: organic matter, water pH, H++Al3+, Al3+, m, V, H2PO4-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and S-SO4-2 were evaluated at 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4 and 0.4-0.6 m soil depth. The variables were submitted ANOVA, joint analysis and Tukey's test (p {\textless} 0.05). The treatments including liming followed by harrowing, plowing and harrowing, and harrowing followed by liming, plowing and harrowing, resulted in the largest gains in soil fertility. In the first year of sugarcane cultivation, the no-tillage system proved to be sustainable and appropriate for sugarcane cultivation economically viable. Â© 2019, Southern Cross Publishing.

TI  - IoT} based farming recommendation system using soil nutrient and environmental condition detection
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Over one third of world workforce are employed in agriculture and the amount is steadily falling because of the financial losses of the farmers. One of the key reason behind this financial loss is the lack of technology in agriculture. Continuous cropping and overuse of fertilizers cause the decline in soil productivity and effect the environment as well. This paper demonstrates how the soil productivity can be optimized by implementing an IoT (Internet of Things) based model. Specifically, the paper describes the way to identify the amount of soil nutrients and environmental conditions, followed by the recommendations for cropping and site specific fertilization. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are the key nutrients that are responsible for the plant growth. Soil moisture, pH level of soil and environmental conditions also effects the productivity of crops. In this present work, the system incorporated with various chemicals and sensors to report NPK level, pH level, soil moisture level, temperature and weather forecast. The proposed system takes the soil sample as the input and performs the chemical reactions, corresponding changes in the color of sample is sensed by color sensors and decoded by colorimetry technique. An android application has been built to show the test report and recommendations based on sensed data. The paper has proposed a scientific way to develop a robust, fully automated and low-cost smart farming solution to suit the socioeconomic conditions of small scale farmers in developing countries.

TI  - A smart agriculture system based on intel galileo for detection of cultivable crops and implemented on soil nutrients
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - The world is in need of food, water, Shelter and without any of these there is no possibility to live. Agriculture is backbone of our nation which indeed supplies food for the entire people but the producers of food are facing many problems like moisture content, fertility of soil which affects the farming. Because of this reason cultivation and production of food grains are decreased. Current scenario is that the farmers need to go research center to test the fertility content of soil and to predict kind of plants can be cultivable in that land. In this paper perfect cultivable plants can be detected properly without approaching soil research centers which consumes more money as well time. By the application of pH sensors the fertility of soil can be measured. By measuring the pH soil nutrient content can be measured and so the suitable cultivable crop for different soil varieties can be predicted. In this view to give a healthful support to farmers, soil nutrients are analyzed and report the requirement using advanced sensors. Â© BEIESP.

AB  - The real-time-based pH and soil moisture monitoring system is one of the solutions for monitoring soil fertility parameters for large areas. The research aims to monitor the pH and soil moisture values in a real-time website-based platform. The system used the Wemos d1 R2 microcontroller that has been planted with the esp8266 Wi-Fi module so that it will connect to the internet or access points wirelessly. The wireless connection method used to avoid cable installation and maintenance, which is complicated and expensive. Wemos d1 R2 also used as a web server using HTTP as a protocol. The sensor used in the system is the FC-28 sensor to measure soil moisture and ETP-110 to measure pH values. The results of pH and soil moisture measurements are displayed on the website. The results of the comparison of soil pH measurements with a soil analyzer as a control and pH sensor ETP-110 showed the average difference 1.58, while the comparison of FC-28 and Soil Analyzer measurements gave a difference of 0.6\% for humidity value. This research successfully built a system that can display data on the website whose value is the same as the value in the database. Â© 2019 IEEE.

VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate measurement of water content (Î¸), apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of soils, and soil solution electrical conductivity (ECw) is critical for a better management of irrigation water and the effective monitoring and control of soil salinity. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and validation of an identical time domain reflectometry (TDRWO) probe for accurate and non-destructive measurements of ECw. Two calibration functions were used to determine the soil-water content by TDR. Theses relations were verified by laboratory experiment over a wide range of Î¸ and bulk density (BD) for dune sand. The exact length and the impedance of all TDR-probes were calibrated using the WinTDR procedure. Estimates of ECw were based on Î¸ and the bulk ECa using a special modeling approach which applies long-time TDR waveform analysis. The geometrical disposition of the matrix phase factors (Ï„ and Î²) was calculated by immersing the TDR probe in sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions of different electrical conductivities in pressure cells wetted and drained with each of these NaCl solutions. The reliability of the TDRWO was validated/proven under laboratory conditions. The laboratory experiment consisted in inserting the TDR probe into a pressure cell packed with mixed sand and 2-mm sieved loam soil that was subsequently wetted and drained with different NaCl solutions at various pressure heads. The ECw estimated by TDRWO was compared to the ECw measured in the draining solutions after they stabilized in the soil porous system. The Ï„ and Î² factors calculated for the ceramic disks sets were 1.991 and 4.312, respectively. In the laboratory experiments, high and therefore significant correlations (R2 = 0.986; P {\textless}.001) were found between the ECw estimated by the TDRWO and the corresponding ECw values measured in the column-drainage. These results demonstrate that the TDRWO is an instrument which allows researchers to accurately estimate soil solution salinity independently of the soil water content and the porous medium in which the TDR probe is installed. Test results showed that the TDR method has high accuracy for monitoring soil water content but is less accurate in monitoring soil electrical conductivity across a water content range of about â‰¤0.03cm3/cm3. Regression analysis between TDR-Volumetric water content (Ï´v) and weighing methodâ€“Ï´v showed good correlation with an R2 of 0.97 and 0.98 during two laboratory experiments.

VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Agriculture is the most important sector of Indian Economy. Indian agriculture sector provides employment to 50\% of the countries workforce. India is the world's largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, sugarcane, pomegranates etc. The current scenario of agriculture business in India is not up to the mark as expected. There are number of reasons which causes less yield in the agriculture such as unpredictable environmental conditions, excess use of fertilizers (cost is increasing day by day), increased draught frequency and its severity, increasing labor rate, less difference between the income and expenditure, ripeness of soil, influenced suspensions, non-appropriate water management, diseases on crops, invasion of animals and so on. There is need to find the ways which makes the use of Information Technology (IT) concepts and tools wherever possible for increasing automation in the agriculture business, which results in the efficient and effective outcome of agriculture i.e. higher yields. The production efficiency can be increased significantly with technological advancement in agriculture. Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel design approach for precision farming. Farming has seen number of technological transformations in the last decade. By using various smart agriculture gadgets, farmers have gained better control over the process of raising the growing crops and livestocks. One of the major issues which cause fewer yields is the soil health. This paper mainly analyses/reviews the problems related to the soil health (soil fertility), which is a main obstacle in the crop production. Also this study focuses on the use of IoT applications in precision farming. It gives an overview of the relation between crop productivity and soil health. Â© BEIESP.

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - With the objective of improving productivity, N economy and soil fertility in wheat-based cropping systems, a fixed plot field experiment was conducted during 2009â€“2011 with two grain legumes, viz. groundnut and soybean for residue management (stover removed and stover incorporated in the succeeding wheat crop) and maize as main plots during rainy season. Wheat was grown in winter season with four levels of N, viz. 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N haâˆ’1 as subplots. Grain legumes (groundnut and soybean) as previous crops had a positive effect on growth and yield of succeeding wheat compared to the maize. Wheat grain yield was 4.59â€“5.02\% higher under groundnut and soybean residue incorporation than residue removal. Groundnut and soybean as preceding crops recorded 9.57â€“10.32\% more yields than maize as preceding crop to wheat. Nitrogen economy in wheat through grain legume residue incorporation was 44.5â€“54 kg N haâˆ’1. Groundnutâ€“wheat cropping system with residue incorporation recorded the highest system productivity (WGEY) (8.84 t haâˆ’1) and net returns (INR 77.5 Ã— 103 haâˆ’1) followed by groundnutâ€“wheat with residue removal. Maximum soil organic carbon (0.46\%) and soil available N (242 kg haâˆ’1) and P (15.73 kg haâˆ’1) were recorded under groundnutâ€“wheat + groundnut residue incorporation, but the highest available K (246.3 kg haâˆ’1) was recorded in soybeanâ€“wheat + soybean residue incorporation and minimum under maizeâ€“wheat. From this study, it is concluded that the inclusion of legumes in wheat-based rotations and their residue incorporation saved the N fertilizer and improved the wheat productivity and soil fertility at the end of 2-year cropping cycle.

The aim of this paper is to test the degree of improvement of various sensor-and soil-specific calibration options compared to factory calibrations by taking the 10HS sensor as an example. To this end, a two-step sensor calibration was carried out. In the first step, the sensor response was related to dielectric permittivity using calibration in media with well-defined permittivity. The second step involved the establishment of a site-specific relationship between permittivity and soil water content using undisturbed soil samples and time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. Our results showed that a model, which considered the mean porosity and a fitted dielectric permittivity of the solid phase for each soil and depth, provided the best fit between bulk permittivity and SWC. Most importantly, it was found that the two-step calibration approach (RMSE: 1.03 vol.\%) provided more accurate SWC estimates compared to the factory calibration (RMSE: 5.33 vol.\%). Finally, we used these calibrations on data from drip-irrigated almond and apple orchards and compared the factory calibration with our two-step calibration approach. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Determination of all-sky surface soil moisture at fine spatial resolution synergistically using optical/thermal infrared and microwave measurements
VL  - 579
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is highly involved in a number of fundamental agricultural activities and hydrological processes. Currently, most of the available microwave SM products are too coarse to be used in these relevant applications at regional or watershed scales, whereas optical/thermal infrared measurements are valid over clear-sky conditions only. The present study aims to provide a novel framework for the retrieval of all-sky surface SM at fine spatial resolution synergistically using optical/thermal infrared and microwave measurements. In this framework, SM for each clear-sky pixel is determined from a novel pixel-to-pixel scheme of land surface temperature-vegetation index (Ts-VI) trapezoid, whereas cloudy pixel SM is derived from coarse microwave-based product disaggregation where gridded meteorological measurements are provided as inputs. Mainland China is selected as the study area to obtain all-sky SM at the spatial resolution of 0.05Â° over the period from August to October in 2017. A preliminary comparison of the estimated all-sky SM with the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS)-derived SM product at the same spatial resolution is conducted to assess the proposed approach. Results indicate that the two datasets show similar spatial patterns throughout mainland China. Moreover, the estimated SM over 300 random pixels correlates well with the CLDAS product, with RMSE ranging from 0.070 to 0.083 m3/m3 and a slight bias varying from âˆ’0.001 to 0.011 m3/m3 on six selected days. The present study therefore successfully provides a framework for the retrieval of all-sky SM content from currently available satellite products. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Integrating ground-based and remote sensing-based monitoring of near-surface soil moisture in a {Mediterranean} environment
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatially explicit near-surface soil moisture (Ã¾eta) patterns at high temporal resolution play a very important role in environmental modelling for improving risk assessment and for quantifying the effects of climatic seasonality and land use/land cover change on ecosystem services and functions in Mediterranean catchments. Remote sensing data from the European Copernicus mission are highly acknowledged to serve as fast, reliable, and available suppliers for the derivation of area wide, high grid-resolution information (20 m Ã— 20 m) on near-surface soil moisture patterns acquired at a regular temporal resolution (satellite overpass is every six days). To reliably map Ã¾eta from remote sensing radar (i.e., Sentinel-1) satellite products, robust calibration with gridded ground-data is needed and use of either sporadically measured or continuously monitored Ã¾eta is of crucial importance for validation procedures. This study integrates remote-and ground-based monitoring of local-To field-scale Ã¾eta in the Alento hydrological observatory situated in southern Italy. This Critical Zone Observatory was recently established in the Mediterranean Region and equipped with a multi-sensor network infrastructure. The final aim of this study is to develop site-specific calibration functions to relate spectral measurements to gridded topographic features to estimate near-surface soil moisture patterns. Estimation performance will be evaluated by comparing remote sensing-based (Sentinel-1) with ground-based soil moisture measured during satellite overpass. The soil moisture transfer relations will eventually support high temporal catchment-based hydrological modeling of groundwater and surface water fluxes under consideration of the climatic variability and in feedback with the vegetation.

TI  - Remote sensing of soil moisture for vegetation/forests with large {VWC} using {NMM3D} full wave simulations
VL  - 2019-July
SN  - NA
AB  - The transmission through vegetation/forest canopy is important for remote sensing of soil moisture. The commonly used vegetation models are distorted Born Approximation (DBA) and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). We recently developed Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D (NMM3D) full wave simulations of vegetation/forests. The results of NMM3D show much larger transmission than that of RTE/DBA. A much larger transmission of NMM3D means microwave emission from soil can reach the radiometer, which is different from the conclusion for microwave remote sensing of soil moisture based on RTE and DBA. In this paper, we implement NMM3D based on the scattered field formulation of Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations (FL). The novelty of this method is that the 3D cylindrical vector wave expansions are used in FL. The correctness of the method is verified. We implement the method on parallel computation using a large number of tall cylinders. Â©2019 IEEE

TI  - Sensor systems for mapping soil fertility attributes: {Challenges}, advances, and perspectives in brazilian tropical soils
VL  - 39
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility attributes have different scales and forms of spatial and temporal variations in agricultural fields. Adequate spatiotemporal characterization of these attributes is fundamental to the successful development of strategies for variable rate application of fertilizers, enabling the classic benefits of precision agriculture (PA). Studies on Brazilian soil have shown that at least 1 sample ha-1 is required for the reliable mapping of key fertility attributes. However, this sampling density is difficult owing to the operational challenges of sample collection and the cost of laboratory analyses. Given this limitation, soil sensors have emerged as a practical and complementary technique for obtaining information on soil attributes, at high spatial density, without the production of chemical residues and at a reduced cost. Scientists worldwide have devoted their attention to the development and application of sensor systems for this purpose. The concept of proximal soil sensing (PSS) was established in 2011 and involves the application of soil sensors directly on the field. PSS techniques involve different disciplines, such as instrumentation, data science, geostatistics, and predictive modeling. The integration of these different disciplines has allowed successful sensor application for the spatial diagnosis of soil fertility attributes. The present work aimed to present a bibliographic review of the concepts involved and main techniques used in soil sensing to predict fertility attributes. We sought to present a broad view of the challenges, advances, and perspectives of sensor application in Brazilian tropical soils in the context of PA.

TI  - Evaluation of soil {pH} and soil moisture with different field sensors: {Case} study urban soil
VL  - 38
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture and pH levels directly affect urban tree performance. An accurate sensor to assess these soil conditions would allow arborists and urban foresters to make and evaluate management actions. These actions may then be used to improve tree species diversity and site quality. Toward this goal, twenty-one soil pH and moisture sensors were tested for their ability to accurately and precisely measure soil pH, volumetric soil moisture content (VMC), or both. This research was conducted on four different soil texture classes (loamy sand, sandy loam, clay loam, and clay) at three different moisture levels (air dry, â‰ˆ 0.5 field capacity, and â‰ˆ field capacity). Soil pH sensors using a glass-electrode in a 1:2 (soil:deionized water) solution were found to accurately and precisely measure soil pH (P = {\textless}0.0001; Ï c = {\textgreater}0.95). However, sensors using metal electrodes inserted into the soil had no significant correlation to soil pH levels (P = {\textgreater}0.1; Ï c = {\textless}0.2). When selecting a soil pH sensor, measurement method may be the most important consideration. Soil VMC sensors using time domain reflectometry and frequency domain reflectometry methods performed best (P = {\textless}0.0001; Ï c = {\textgreater}0.76). Sensors using the electrical conductivity method were highly variable in cost, accuracy, and precision. Future work on these sensors may include field performance evaluations as well as management implications for urban sites. Â© 2019 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Large range soil moisture sensing for inhomogeneous environments using magnetic induction networks
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Water resource has become one of the most precious resources in recent decades. Agriculture accounts for about 80\% of the total water usage in US. There is a demanding need for efficient irrigation and water management systems built for sustainable water utilization in smart agriculture. Real time in-situ soil moisture sensing is a vital part for smart agriculture. Traditional electromagnetic (EM) based soil moisture sensing relies on EM based wireless sensor or ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. Based on the receiving signal strength and delay, tomographic techniques are used to derive the dielectric parameters of the soil, which are then into soil moisture distribution using empirical model. However, the EM signal attenuate sharply during underground propagation because of high operating frequency and lossy medium. In order to counter the disadvantage for underground sensing, we propose a Magnetic Induction (MI) based large range soil moisture sensing scheme in inhomogeneous environments. Here, we present the topology of the sensing system and analyze the channel model. The sensing process is based on transformed model, the conductivity and permittivity distribution are derived using SIRT algorithm. Through COMSOL simulation and analytical results, our proposed soil moisture sensing method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.06 m-3/m-3 in 40 m 2D scale inhomogeneous environment range.

TI  - Sampling depth of {L}-band radiometer measurements of soil moisture and freeze-thaw dynamics on the {Tibetan} {Plateau
VL  - 226
SN  - NA
AB  - Knowing the exact sampling depth of microwave radiometry is essential for quantifying the performance and appreciation of the applicability of satellite soil moisture products. We investigate in this study the sampling depth (Î´ SM ) of the L-band microwave emission under frozen and thawed soil conditions on the Tibetan Plateau. Two years of diurnal brightness temperature (T B p ) measurements at a time interval of 30 min are collected by the ELBARA-III radiometer deployed at a Tibetan meadow site. Vertical profiles of soil temperature and volumetric liquid water content (Î¸ liq ) are measured simultaneously at soil depths up to 1 m below the surface. The impact of the Î¸ liq measured at different depths on the microwave emission simulations is assessed using the Ï„-Ï‰ emission model, whereby the permittivity of frozen and thawed soil is estimated by the four-phase dielectric mixing model. It is found that: 1) the sampling depth for the effective temperature depends on the magnitude of Î¸ liq , and is estimated to be, on average, about 50 and 15 cm for the cold dry and wet warm period, respectively, because of the seasonality in Î¸ liq ; 2) the Î´ SM is determined at 2.5 cm for both frozen and thawed soil conditions during both cold and warm periods, which is shallower than the commonly used Î¸ liq measurement depth (i.e. 5 cm) adopted for the in-situ monitoring networks across the globe; 3) the T B p simulations performed with the Î¸ liq measurements taken at the estimated Î´ SM of 2.5 cm result in lower unbiased root mean squared errors, about 14\% (3.16 K) and 22\% (3.36 K) for the horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively, in comparison to the simulations with the Î¸ liq measurements taken from 5 cm soil depth; and 4) the Î¸ liq retrieved with the single channel algorithm from the ELBARA-III measured vertically polarized T B p are in better agreement with the Î¸ liq measured at 2.5 cm than the one measured at 5 cm. These findings are crucial for developing strategies for the calibration/validation as well as the application of satellite based soil moisture products relying on the L-band radiometry.

This paper focuses on the principle of GNSS-R technology and reflection signal characteristics and studies the method of extracting characteristic parameters of multi-path components from SNR observation based on single-antenna mode for SNR multi-path component remote sensing. On this basis, this paper designs and develops soil moisture inversion based on Matlab platform.

VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry systems strongly impact soil properties, yet their effects on the stoichiometry of soil nutrients remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the tree-cropping systems effects on soil C, N, P and K concentrations and their stoichiometry in 0â€“10 and 10â€“20 cm soil depths in a purple hillslope of southwestern China. Five typical agroforestry systems, including Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck system (CO), CO and Ipomoea batatas (L.) system (CI), CO and Arachis hypogaea (L.) system (CA), CO and Zea mays (L.) system (CZ), and CO and Solanum melongena (L.) system (CS), were investigated. Tree-cropping systems (i.e. CI, CA, CZ and CS) showed significantly higher soil C, N, P and K concentrations and clay percentage, and lower bulk density than CO system. Nutrient ratios altered inconsistently among five agroforestry systems. Soil depth differed N concentration, N:K ratio, bulk density and total porosity. Soil nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry showed significant correlations with physical properties. N:P ratio was 69.78 and 78.55\% lower than the Chinese and World averages in the 0â€“10 cm soil depth, indicating that severe N limitation occurred in the agroforestry systems. Rational N fertilization and allocation of tree-cropping systems are urgently needed for sustainable development of agroforestry.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The main role of soil moisture sensor is to measure the moisture content present in a soil and thus it is helpful in efficient irrigation management practices. This paper outlines the soil moisture sensor designed using the capacitive measurement principle due to its advantages of low cost and high sensitivity over other methods. The DC and AC analysis is performed over the soil using this sensor to explore the properties of soil e.g. capacitance, dielectric constant etc. which can be very useful for many applications e.g. hydrology, agriculture and weather forecasting departments. The dielectric properties of different type of soils are studied at the frequency range of 100 Hz - 1 MHz and it is observed that dielectric constant of soil, which is directly proportional to capacitance, increases with increased moisture content of soil and decreases with it vice-versa. The DC analysis proves that the moisture content increases the electrical voltage of the soil by 70-80\% if compared with the dry soil electrical voltage, whereas AC analysis emphasis on the frequency range which is ideal for stable performance of designed capacitive soil moisture sensor.

TI  - Estimating surface soil moisture from satellite observations using machine learning trained on in situ measurements in the continental {U}.{S
VL  - 2019-July
SN  - NA
AB  - This study attempts to develop a novel solution for the estimation of regional surface soil moisture (SSM) using a machine learning model trained on in situ measurement target data. Specifically, the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is employed to establish the relationship between in-situ measurements from Sparse Network Stations (SNSs) in the continental U.S. and passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite for April 2015 to March 2018. More importantly, to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of in situ measurements, we turn to the extended triple collocation technique whereby individual SNSsâ€™ reliability at the SMAP coarse footprint is determined before fed into GRNN. The cross-validation results show that the GRNN model trained on reliable SNSs obtains a fairly good performance, with out-of-sample cross-validated R and unbiased RMSE values of 0.92 and 0.043 cm3 cm-3, respectively. Moreover, the comparison in space shows that the spatial patterns of GRNN retrievals is the most consistent with in situ measurements than both the SMAPL3SMP and the ERA-Interim SSM data. Furthermore, the GRNN-estimated SSM time series over stations agrees much better with in-situ measurements than the official SMAP passive SSM product. All these results indicate that the statistical GRNN modeling has shown great potential in estimating reliable regional SSM climate records using in-situ measurements as training references.

TI  - Assessment and inter-comparison of recently developed/reprocessed microwave satellite soil moisture products using {ISMN} ground-based measurements
VL  - 224
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in understanding the climate system through its control on the land surface energy, water budget partitioning, and the carbon cycle. Monitoring SM at regional scale has become possible thanks to microwave remote sensing. In the past two decades, several satellites were launched carrying on board either radiometer (passive) or radar (active) or both sensors in different frequency bands with various spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture algorithms are in rapid development and their improvements/revisions are ongoing. The latest SM retrieval products and versions of products that have been recently released are not yet, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluated and inter-compared over different ecoregions and climate conditions. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the most recent microwave-based SM retrieval products available from NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, ESA's led mission (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite, ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) sensor on board the meteorological operational (Metop) platforms Metop-A and Metop-B, and the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) blended long-term SM time series. More specifically, in this study we compared SMAPL3 V4, SMOSL3 V300, SMOSL2 V650, ASCAT H111, and CCI V04.2 and the new SMOS-IC (V105) SM product. This evaluation was achieved using four statistical scores: Pearson correlation (considering both original observations and anomalies), RMSE, unbiased RMSE, and Bias between remotely-sensed SM retrievals and ground-based measurements from {\textgreater}1000 stations from 17 monitoring networks, spread over the globe, disseminated through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The analysis reveals that the performance of the remotely-sensed SM retrievals generally varies depending on ecoregions, land cover types, climate conditions, and between the monitoring networks. It also reveals that temporal sampling of the data, the frequency of data in time and the spatial coverage, affect the performance metrics. Overall, the performance of SMAP and SMOS-IC products compared slightly better with respect to the ISMN in situ observations than the other remotely-sensed products. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Development and application of the soil moisture routing ({SMR}) model to identify subfield-scale hydrologic classes in dryland cropping systems using the {Budyko} framework
VL  - 573
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172\% and 137\% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91\% in the western-most field to approximately 70\% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

TI  - Study on locust disaster monitoring based on smos {L2} soil moisture data
VL  - 2019-January
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable in the growth and reproduction of locusts. Based on SMOS L2 soil moisture data (2011-2016), together with FAO statistical information (2012-2016) and ISRIC soil property grid data (2016), this paper investigated the relationships between soil moisture and the locust hatching period, spatial distribution and outbreak areas within the arid and semi-arid regions of South Caucasus. Results verified that, SMOS soil moisture is capable in locust disaster monitoring: (1) the annual fluctuation of soil moisture during March to May showed good indication on the locust hatching period (R {\textgreater} 0.7), while with higher soil moisture condition ({\textgreater} 0.2 m3/m3), the beginning date was delayed remarkably; (2) the spatial distribution of soil moisture also reflected the degree of devastation, and its annual average had a significant correlation with the infected areas with R {\textgreater} 0.8; (3) a forecast of the potential locust area in a next year could be effectively made by extracting the soil moisture variation pattern in multiple years. The research demonstrated the utilization of satellite microwave soil moisture is feasible and effective in locust disaster monitoring, which could future provides decisionmaking support in activities of disaster alleviation and prevention.

TI  - Calibration and accuracy of two electromagnetic methods of soil moisture measurement in oxisol; [{CalibraÃ§Ã£o} e precisÃ£o de dois mÃ©todos eletromagnÃ©ticos de mediÃ§Ã£o de umidade do solo em oxisol]
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurately measuring soil moisture is an important technological challenge. Sensors development and validation for agricultural applications is a relevant research theme. Electromagnetic techniques have been shown to be useful for soil moisture measurement. However, these techniques typically benefit from calibration. In this context, the aim of this study was to calibrate and evaluate the accuracy and precision of the soil moisture measured by two devices with different electromagnetic principles: Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) e High Frequency Soil Impedance (HFSI) in the laboratory with in oxisol. The probes used were Diviner 2000 and Hidrofarm HFM 1010. Soil moisture was measured using both FDR and HFSI probes. A large variation in soil moisture values occurred during the experiment, as it varied from 0.489 m3 m-3 to 0.077 m3 m-3. Both electromagnetic methods showed good correlation compared to the standard method (gravimetric). HFSI probe overestimated the soil moisture values when compared to the gravimetric method, while FDR underestimated the values. Â© 2019, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-platform radiometer systems for surface soil moisture retrieval
VL  - 2019-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Readily available soil moisture data will help farmers to better optimize their irrigation scheduling and minimize water consumption. Consequently, there is a large and accelerating interest in using sensing technologies in precision agriculture worldwide. Among them, passive microwave sensing technology has been considered as the most accurate in retrieving soil moisture. This study compares the performance of an L-band radiometer system at two different platforms: airborne and near-surface (buggy). Field experiments have been conducted across an agricultural site in Tasmania, Australia for three consecutive days for. Ground sampling was also conducted in order to evaluate the accuracy of both L-band radiometer systems. Brightness temperature data from the buggy showed a larger temporal variation on individual days than the aircraft data, likely due to the irrigation activity during the longer period required for data collection by the buggy than for the aircraft. In terms of the relationship between brightness temperature and soil moisture, both platforms showed similar results while the buggy-based data showed a slightly better correlation with soil moisture.

TI  - Combining {UAV}-based hyperspectral imagery and machine learning algorithms for soil moisture content monitoring
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important factor that affects agricultural development in arid regions. Compared with the spaceborne remote sensing system, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used because of its stronger controllability and higher resolution. It also provides a more convenient method for monitoring SMC than normal measurement methods that includes field sampling and oven-drying techniques. However, research based on UAV hyperspectral data has not yet formed a standard procedure in arid regions. Therefore, a universal processing scheme is required. We hypothesized that combining pretreatments of UAV hyperspectral imagery under optimal indices and a set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a highly accurate estimate of SMC. Optimal 2D spectral indices act as indispensable variables and allow us to characterize a modelâ€™s SMC performance and spatial distribution. For this purpose, we used hyperspectral imagery and a total of 70 topsoil samples (0â€“10 cm) from the farmland (2.5Ã—104 m2) of Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The random forest (RF) method and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to estimate the SMC using six methods of pretreatments combined with four optimal spectral indices. The validation accuracy of the estimated method clearly increased compared with that of linear models. The combination of pretreatments and indices by our assessment effectively eliminated the interference and the noises. Comparing two machine learning algorithms showed that the RF models were superior to the ELM models, and the best model was PIR (R2val = 0.907, RMSEP = 1.477 and RPD = 3.396). The SMC map predicted via the best scheme was highly similar to the SMC map measured. We conclude that combining preprocessed spectral indices and machine learning algorithms allows estimation of SMC with high accuracy (R2val = 0.907) via UAV hyperspectral imagery on a regional scale. Ultimately, our program might improve management and conservation strategies for agroecosystem systems in arid regions. Â© 2019 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Purpose: Intensive agriculture activities in small holder farming systems are declining over all soil nutrient status. The present study is conducted to compare the soil health and plant growth attributes under rice cultivation among different organic amendments. Recycled waste of riceâ€“wheat agrosystem is utilized to determine optimal sustainable solution for hilly areas. Methods: Randomly blocked design experiment was conducted with rice plants, each amended with organic inputs including rice straw residue (T1), rice biochar (T2), rice compost (T3), wheat straw residue (T4), wheat biochar (T5), wheat compost (T6), mix of wheat + rice compost (T7), green manure (T8) and control (no amendment). Soil samples were studied at each growth phase while plant growth attributes were measured at the harvesting stage of the crop. Results: T6 and T7 have shown significantly higher magnitude of soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, microbial quotient, available nitrogen, and enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and urease) than biochar (T2 and T5) and crop residue amendments (T1, T4 and T8). An increase of up to 47\% was obtained in cumulative growth attributes (plant height, total biomass, and a number of tillers, spikes, and spike length) of rice plant in T6 amendment. The principal component analysis revealed two components responsible for 54.17\% of the variance in the organically treated soil. Conclusion: The experimental results imply that composting of crop residues could be the most reliable practice to improve soil nutritional quality as well as crop growth for sustainable riceâ€“wheat cropping system in the hilly area.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval by integrating {TASI}-600 airborne thermal data, {WorldView} 2 satellite data and field measurements: {Petacciato} case study
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in the terrestrial water cycle and in agriculture, with key applications such as the monitoring of crop growing and hydrogeological management. In this study, a calibration procedure was applied to estimate SM based on the integration of in situ and airborne thermal remote sensing data. To this aim, on April 2018, two airborne campaigns were carried out with the TASI-600 multispectral thermal sensor on the Petacciato (Molise, Italy) area. Simultaneously, soil samples were collected in different agricultural fields of the study area to determine their moisture content and the granulometric composition. A WorldView 2 high-resolution visible-near infrared (VNIR) multispectral satellite image was acquired to calculate the albedo of the study area to be used together with the TASI images for the estimation of the apparent thermal inertia (ATI). Results show a good correlation (R 2 = 0.62) between the estimated ATI and the SM of the soil samples measured in the laboratory. The proposed methodology has allowed us to obtain a SM map for bare and scarcely vegetated soils in a wide agricultural area in Italy which concerns cyclical hydrogeological instability phenomena.

TI  - Study and application of methods of soil moisture content data assimilation for regions partially lacking of observation data
VL  - 2019-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Data assimilation is always considered as the reliable method to obtain space-time continuous soil moisture content, which is of great significance for regional water resource management. Effective observation data input plays an important role in maintaining steady output of assimilation error and improving the capacity of data assimilation. During the process of data assimilation with remote sensing for observation on regional scale, it is hard to guarantee the completeness of regional observation data. Sometimes, some parts of research region have no remote sensing observation, which leads that region of the modelling and data assimilation has no coordinate with region of remote sensing observation. In the part of region without remote sensing observation (lacking-observation region), data assimilation canâ€™t be performed like in the part of region with remote sensing observation (observation region) because there no observation data to input but modelling data to the data assimilation system. And then it may influence the precision of data assimilation results in lacking-observation region. Thereby, we should promote the completeness of regional observation data and maybe fill the remote sensing images with some mathematical and statistical methods, one of which is that extend the differences(model errors) between modelling results and remote sensing observation data in the observation region to the lacking-observation region. This research used geostatistical methods to extend model errors from observation region to lacking-observation region. Then we calculate data assimilation results in lacking-observation region combined with land surface modelling results in lacking-observation region, thus to obtain the complete data assimilation results in whole research region. Itâ€™s shown that this method can truly improve data assimilation capacity in the overall research region. Meanwhile, this method can improve the data assimilation effectiveness in current period and also the subsequent period. It shows this method has active effects on maintaining the continuous and steady data assimilation result. Thus, this method can be an effective means to improve regional data assimilation capacity when lack of regional observation data. Â©2019 IEEE

TI  - Estimating and mapping pasture soil fertility in a portuguese montado based on a objective model and geostatistical techniques
VL  - 157
SN  - NA
AB  - Pasture soils can exhibit a high spatial variability which should be characterised to properly manage the yield potential of different within-field areas. Thus, with the aim of proposing an objective methodology to estimate the pasture soil fertility and, later, analyse its spatial pattern, the formulation of the probabilistic Rasch model constitutes a new approach in pasture fields. In this research, a case study was performed to illustrate the proposed method. Consequently, after taking some soil samples (34) and measuring different soil properties (sand, silt, and clay content, organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, moisture content, soil apparent electrical conductivity, elevation, and slope), the use of the Rasch model provides a integrated measure of pasture soil fertility at each sampling location, which can be computed using geostatistical algorithms to map its spatial distribution throughout the field. After verifying that data fit the model reasonably, the main outputs of the Rasch model were a ranking of all sampling locations according to the pasture soil fertility and another ranking of the soil properties according to their influence on the soil fertility, being the topographical properties (slope and elevation) the most influential. Later, the ordinary kriging algorithm was utilised to estimate soil fertility throughout the pasture field and the probability kriging algorithm was used to provide information for hazard assessment of pasture soil fertility, being both kriged maps the basis to delineate homogeneous zones. Finally, vegetation indices and pasture yield data at sampling points were employed to check that two zones previously determined were different. The analysis of zonal differences in pasture systems can lead to an optimal application of inputs and a more cost-effective management, with the associated environmental, economic, and energetic benefits.

AB  - The soil is the interface between the biology and geology forming the living skin of the earth, and the water in it keeps the earth alive. Timely information on soil moisture is useful to monitor and forecast agricultural droughts, wildfires, flood risk areas, landslides, etc., Soil moisture measurement using L-band radiometry is now widely accepted as the state-of-art remote sensing approach, and has been adopted by both the soil moisture dedicated satellite missions â€“ Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). P-band, which is a longer wavelength measurement, provides the potential to retrieve deeper soil moisture information and to do so more accurately due to reduced soil roughness and vegetation effects. There are very few works using P-band radiometer [1,2] conducted at the USDA / Beltsville Agricultural Research Centre employing truck-mounted L-, C- and P- band radiometers. Â© 2019 URSI.

TI  - Soil fertility status assessment using hyperspectral remote sensing
VL  - 11149
SN  - NA
AB  - Information about NPK content in farm soil is important for further application of the necessary dosage of fertilizer. At present, laboratory-based chemical analysis is being used to assess the status of soil nutrients, but these methods are complex, tedious, costly, and poor in in-situ condition. While, for precise farming, in-situ assessment of soil fertility status is of prime importance. Hyper-spectral remote sensing bears the potential of a detailed investigation of soil through analysis of its spectral absorption features. Therefore, this study aims to estimate quantitatively the content of fertilizer in a sample of soil making use of spectral properties of macro soil nutrients. For addressing the abovementioned issues, this study has used Derivative Analysis for Spectral Unmixing (DASU), approach consisting of spectral unmixing and spectral derivative analysis. The study reveals that the spectral region 993.2nm provides a unique feature. It leads to the development of a model for estimation of NPK fractional abundance in a soil sample. Further, this model has been validated for the good number of soil samples in a laboratory. Thus, the key contribution of this study is to underpin that; the hyper-spectral remote sensing may be used in-situ to estimate soil fertility of farm soil. Although, the fractional abundances of individual components of NPK may be considered as future scope of work. Â© 2019 SPIE.

TI  - Soil fertility status and nutrient inputâ€“output flows of specialised organic cropping systems: a review
VL  - 112
SN  - NA
AB  - The management of specialised organic crops for vegetable and fruit production require the use of imported fertilizers. A wide range of fertilizers is currently available to organic farmers. These include bulky organic materials with a relatively low nutrient concentration commonly used as base dressing (e.g. composts, solid animal manures) and complementary commercial organic fertilizers with relatively high nutrient concentrations to adjust nutrient supply to crop requirements (e.g. feather meal, hoof and horn meal, vinasse, meat and bone meal, etc.). Nutrient imbalances are a major threat affecting the long term sustainability of horticultural and fruit cultivation systems. Major reasons for these imbalances are the biased element composition of base as well as complementary fertilizers in relation to the nutrient offtakes via harvested products. Gaseous nitrogen losses during manure management and gaseous as well as leaching nitrogen losses after application are major reasons for such nutrient imbalances, as they lead to a relative increase in the concentration of other elements. Conceptual weaknesses in the fertilizer approach in organic farming exist, namely the preferred application of slow release nitrogen fertilizers often rich in phosphorus. This review suggests that the current soil fertility approaches based on application of solid fertilizers and simultaneously a low rate of N inputs via N2 fixation do not foster balanced nutrient levels. The key challenge is to design cropping systems with a higher share of N inputs via biological N2 fixation, and to find fertilizers with a nutrient stoichiometry better suited to match the overall specific offtakes of fertilized crops.

AB  - Agriculture contributes only 22\% of income to Indian economy. The major cause to this drop is natural calamity and variations in the nutrients of soil due to environ-mental changes. Overcoming the awful situations due to natural calamity challenges is arduous. Technology can be applied to understand the variations in the soil nutrient thereby helping the farmer community to find out a positive solution. In this paper we have proposed a cost effective model that is deployed using sensors so that the analysis of the soil can be done in most simplest manner. The model discussed here has been experimented and proved to provide 90\% accuracy. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Topographic {Controls} on {Soil} {Nutrient} {Variations} in a {Silvopasture} {System
VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas: Topographic variation influenced soil nutrient distribution in a silvopasture system. High-resolution digital maps of soil nutrients were generated. Terrain attributes identified topographic functional units as management zones. Level of soil nutrients in topographic functional units were different. Topography plays a crucial role in spatial distribution of nutrients in soils; however, studies to quantify topographic influence on soil nutrient distribution from a silvopasture system are mostly lacking. To address this question, a 4.3-ha silvopasture site in northwest Arkansas was selected and a total of 51 topsoil (0â€“15 cm thickness) samples were collected and analyzed for primary (total N [TN], P, K), secondary (Ca, Mg, S), and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, B, Na). Topographic information was acquired from 12 terrain attributes derived from a 1-m digital elevation model. The prediction model was based on random forest. Results showed TN, S, and P were best predicted, whereas Cu, Ca, and Mn had the lowest prediction performance. Levels of S, Ca, Zn, Fe, and TN increased with SAGA wetness index, valley depth, flow accumulation, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index. Normalized height and slope height were positively related to Na but negatively to B and Cu distribution. Aspect had a positive influence on P and Mg concentrations. Based on terrain attributes, the study site could be divided into four topographic functional units (TFU), namely A, B, C, and D; TFU A had the highest nutrients present, whereas TFU B had the lowest P, K, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ca but highest Na content. However, Mn, Mg, and B did not vary among TFUs. This study affirmed topographic influences on soil nutrient distribution, and the resulting continuous soil nutrient maps are useful for fine-tuning production systems through optimum nutrient and pasture management.

VL  - 562
SN  - NA
AB  - This Soil moisture is an important part of the surface water cycle. Effective monitoring of soil moisture is of great significance for weather forecasting, flood forecasting and crop growth. Existing soil moisture monitoring methods (such as drying weighing, remote sensing observation, hygrometer measurement, etc.) have high cost, low spatial and temporal resolution, damage to observation objects, time-consuming and laborious, and long repeated observation periods. With the rapid development of GNSS remote sensing, the GPS signal based on microwave L-band is used for soil moisture monitoring with the advantages of low cost, high time resolution, strong real-time and high automation, which has attracted the attention of many scholars. This paper intends to study the soil moisture inversion algorithm based on GPS signal-to-noise ratio. Firstly, based on the basic principle, the inversion process is given. The fitting phase is zero-processed and the fusion is performed according to the correlation coefficient. Finally, a linear model of humidity is established. The inversion of the PBO plan station data was carried out, and the soil moisture data provided by PBO was compared. The results confirmed that the accuracy and stability of soil moisture inversion using GPS signal-to-noise ratio were improved by zero processing and weighted fusion.

VL  - 2018-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture retrieval from microwave remote sensing brightness temperatures is in continuous development. In this study, the most recent and latest microwave remote sensing soil moisture products were evaluated against ground-based measurements. We compared, for the first time, the latest versions of SMOS (L2V650 and SMOS-IC V105), SMAP (L3V4), and CCI (V03.2) soil moisture products with respect to ground-based measurements obtained from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network). Time series were plotted over some sites and it was found that all these products capture well the temporal dynamics over all the sites used in this study. However, CCI was wetter than the in situ measurements over Niger and both SMOS products (IC and L2) and SMAP were drier than the in situ observations over Biebrza site in Poland. Â© 2018 IEEE

TI  - Towards multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval using {P}- and {L}-band passive microwave sensing technology
VL  - 2018-July
SN  - NA
AB  - A fundamental limitation of current soil moisture remote sensing technology is that can only provide moisture information on the top 5 cm layer of soil at most, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the wavelength (21 cm at L-band; 1.4 GHz) using the current SMAP and SMOS soil moisture dedicated missions of NASA and ESA. Consequently, we have developed an airborne passive microwave sensing capability at P-band to develop a new state-of-the-art satellite concept that will provide soil moisture data for the top 10 cm layer of soil using radiometer observations at P-band (40 cm; 750 MHz). Not only would P-band provide soil moisture information on a soil layer thickness that more closely relates to that affecting crop and pasture growth, but it is expected to produce greater spatial coverage with improved accuracy to that from L-band. This is because P-band should be less affected by surface roughness conditions and have a reduced attenuation by the overlaying vegetation. This paper describes a series of small airborne field experiments at P-band, and presents some early results of P-band passive microwave observations in comparison with L-band and Kband passive microwave from initial trial flights.

TI  - Assessment of soil fertility under different land-use systems in {Dhading} {District} of {Nepal
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Unscientific land use and cropping techniques have led high soil erosion and degradation of soil quality in the mid-hills of Nepal. To understand the effects of land use systems for selected soil chemical properties in mid-hills, composite soil samples at 0 cm to 20 cm depth were collected from five different land-use systems: Grassland, forest land, upland, lowland, and vegetable farms from Dhading district of Nepal in 2017. Soil samples were analyzed for soil fertility parameters: Soil pH, organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K) and its effect due to different land use systems were compared. Results showed that soil pH was neutral in vegetable farms (6.61), whereas the rest of the land-use systems had acidic soils. Soil OM (3.55\%) and N (0.18\%) content was significantly higher in forest, but the lowest soil OM (1.26\%) and N (0.06\%) contents were recorded from upland and lowland farms, respectively. Available P was the highest in the vegetable farm (41.07 mg kgâˆ’1) and was the lowest in grazing land (2.89 mg kgâˆ’1). The upland farm had significantly higher P levels (39.89 mg kgâˆ’1) than the lowland farm (9.02 mg kgâˆ’1). Available K was the highest in the vegetable farm (130.2 mg kgâˆ’1) and lowest in grazing land (36.8 mg kgâˆ’1). These results indicated that the land under traditional mixed cereal-based farming had poor soil health compared with adjacent vegetable, grazing, and forest lands among the study area. The variations in soil fertility parameters suggest the immediate need for improvement in soil health of traditional farmlands. Â© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Restoration of soil fertility and management of mineral nutrition in a peach orchard under a sustainable farming system in semi-arid conditions
VL  - 1217
SN  - NA
AB  - One of the main environmental challenges of the 21st century is to face the increase in soil degradation. Nowadays, there is evidence that sustainable orchard management practices can contribute to increasing the SOC, reducing soil CO2 emissions, recovering soil fertility and increasing yields. The main objective of this research was to improve the mineral nutrition management, considering soil fertility parameters and N mineralization, in a peach orchard managed under alternative agricultural practices. One of the most important agronomic practices is irrigation, which is essential for plant production and can increase nutrients availability through soil N and C mineralization, with a direct effect on soil quality. The monitoring of soil nitrates and soil quality index (Nc/Nk ratio) along the row (R), wetted and along the inter-row (I), rain-fed, in the orchard under localized irrigation was performed. The results revealed spatial (R, I) and seasonal variability of soil nitrates and soil quality. This study shows that the long-term adoption of localized irrigation and of sustainable agricultural practices has positive effects on soil quality, with benefits to the stability of the whole agro-ecosystem.

TI  - Advances in soil moisture retrieval from near-surface measurements using satellite remote sensing
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture influences numerous environmental processes occurring over large spatial and temporal scales. It profoundly influences the hydrological and meteorological activity together with climate predictions and hazard analysis. Space-borne sensors are capable of retrieving the surface soil moisture over a region on a regular basis. Latent heat measurements of soil, reflectance based methods, microwave measurements and synergistic approaches are some of the techniques used since long for providing soil moisture estimates over regional and global scales. Due to the dynamic interaction of soil with crops, retrieval of surface soil moisture is always challenging. This paper gives a brief overview of advance in soil moisture retrieval techniques, and an attempt to generate surface soil moisture from fine-resolution satellite remote sensing data. The optical remote sensing explores the linear relationship between land surface reflectance and soil moisture content, and through development of empirical spectral vegetation indices. Another way to estimate soil moisture emerged by measuring amplitude of diurnal temperature, which is closely related to thermal conductivity and heat capacity of soil. Emergence of radiometric satellite measurements at fine resolution has reached at a higher level of technology these days. Microwave remote sensing techniques have a long legacy of providing surface soil moisture estimates with reasonable accuracy. The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Passive and Active) missions launched in 2009 and 2015 respectively, are completely dedicated for providing soil moisture at global scale with a spatial resolution of 35km \& 3-40km. These soil moisture products, however, provides data at highly coarser spatial resolution. The launch of Sentinels gave insight by providing active radar and optical data at higher resolution ( 10m). Sentinel-1 is the first SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) constellation having 6-day revisit time providing data in C-band with dual polarisations. However, no algorithm or methodology is available to generate surface soil moisture product at a finer resolution from dual polarisations. Sentinel-1 data has been used to generate regional surface soil moisture image through modelling. The same has been also used for generating surface soil moisture map of IARI farm at New Delhi. Dubois, a bare surface model, was tested for its suitability for surface soil moisture retrieval of the farm. In addition, radar- based Soil moisture (SM) proxy method was used over Sentinel-1 data for the month of July 2018, and validated through actual surface soil moisture (gravimetric) measurements. Results were satisfactory for a range of 4-16 m3m-3 of soil moisture, with coefficient of determination (R2) as 0.45, RMSE of 2.35 and a p-value of 0.005. However, over a higher range of soil moisture (21-33 m3m-3), which occurred after the rainfall, the R2 value reduced to 0.22 with larger RMSE. Results suggested that SM-proxy approach might work well for a limited range (drier part) of soil moisture content, and not for the wet soil. Â© Authors 2018.

TI  - Automatic prediction of village-wise soil fertility for several nutrients in {India} using a wide range of regression methods
VL  - 154
SN  - NA
AB  - In low quality soils, as in the Indian state of Maharashtra, a sustainable land management practice is very important to enhance the soil quality and to maintain proper values for several nutrients that are relevant for an optimal crop yield. The evaluation of a soil fertility index for these nutrients and for each geographical place allows to create maps of village-wise fertility indices which are very useful for fertility management. An automatic prediction of such fertility indices would be very important to reduce the amount of chemical measurements of nutrients to be performed in different cultivation lands. The current study develops the prediction of fertility indices for soil organic carbon and four important soil nutrients (phosphorus pentoxide, iron, manganese and zinc) using almost all the available regression methods, specifically a collection of 76 regressors which belong to 20 families, including neural networks, deep learning, support vector regression, random forests, bagging and boosting, lasso and ridge regression, Bayesian models and more. The best results are achieved by the extremely randomized regression trees (extraTrees), with which achieve an acceptable prediction accuracy (average squared correlations between 0.57 and 0.70), being also relatively fast. Other regressors with high performance are random forests and regularized random forest, generalized boosting regression model and epsilon-support vector regression. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Towards the {Commercialization} of a {Lab}-on-a-{Chip} {Device} for {Soil} {Nutrient} {Measurement
VL  - 953
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper, we present a soil nutrient sensor based on the capillary electrophoresis chip technology. As a product intended for commercial use in soil nutrient analysis, we focused on the analysis of -NO3 and -SO4. The sensing core of the device is the microfluidic chip. The design of chip, adapted to the needs of a portable handheld device, hinders the flow of sample in the detection area - due to non-planarity of instalment or pressure differences - via a narrow injection channel. A known issue, is the injection discrepancies caused by chip-to-chip variances and overall ion strength, thus turning quantitative analysis into a challenge. We overcame this by adopting bromide as an internal standard. In order to discriminate bromide from ubiquitous chloride in soil samples we used polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a separation additive in our background electrolyte. An in-house algorithm was developed for the identification of the measurement peaks, consisting of a baseline smoothing and subtraction along with an optimized quantification of the area under the peaks and thus the ion concentration. For the detection of the ion concentration on-chip electrodes were utilized for a capacitively coupled conductivity measurement. Tests were performed with soil sample extractions from different regions and the results were cross-referenced with an ion chromatographer. The sensorâ€™s response had to be corrected for different ions and it exhibited a second order polynomial response with an average absolute error of 5\%. Â© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Remote sensing of root-zone soil moisture using {I}- and {P}-band signals of opportunity: {Instrument} validation studies
VL  - 2018-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an essential variable in meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. A penetration depth sufficient to sense RZSM requires frequencies below about 500 MHz (I- and P-band). Active or passive microwave sensing in these bands presents substantial technical challenges due to antenna size, radio frequency interference (RFI) and competition for spectrum. Bistatic radar using Signal of Opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital satellite transmitters) offers an alternative approach, through reutilizing powerful signals already occupying bands allocated for communications. Airborne experiments using 240-270 MHz sources were conducted in October 2016, followed by a campaign using 360-380 MHz from a fixed tower location in an agricultural research site during the 2017 growing season. A new campaign that will also include I-band (137 MHz) is presently being installed in advance of the 2018 season. This paper will summarize activities to support the reduction of data from these campaigns and development of soil moisture profile retrievals. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - The {Petrophysical} {Relationship} between the {Dielectric} {Permittivity} and {Water} {Content} of {Peat} {Soil} {Moisture} {Measurements
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Understanding the water content patterns of soil is important in agriculture, ecosystems, and in terms of the quality of the soil, especially in peat soil. To determine the water content of peat soil, an appropriate site-specific petrophysical relationship is needed. Although a few petrophysical relationships have been established, such as the Topp equation, which is commonly used by researchers to determine the water content, the signal tends to deviate when applied in organic soils. Hence, this study aims to determine a mathematical model for the site-specific petrophysical relationship between the dielectric permittivity and the soil moisture of peat soil. Samples of peat soil were taken for laboratory measurement. A two-dimensional adjusted parallel plate capacitor was designed and fabricated for determination of the dielectric permittivity. The oven drying process was conducted for estimation of the water content. A model fitting of the relationship between the dielectric permittivity and water content was proposed, and the results indicate that a two-dimensional adjustable soil cylindrical capacitor can be used to construct a good relationship between the dielectric permittivity and the water content. Hence this appropriate site specific petrophysical relationship can be used by the GPR to determine the water content of the peat soil. Linear and polynomial models were adjusted for the peat soil in respect of the dielectric permittivity and water content. Through verifying this site-specific petrophysical relationship using GPR with a frequency of 250MHz, the adjusted linear and polynomial models provide sufficient accuracy to determine the water content of peat soil.

TI  - Advances in monitoring soil nutrients by near infrared spectroscopy
VL  - 546
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients play an important role in crop growth, and traditional monitoring methods are still the first choice for high precision measurement. However, it is necessary to have a quicker and simpler way to improve the efficiency of soil nutrient monitoring because of its long monitoring time, pollution and high labor cost. Near infrared spectroscopy has become the focus of its research because of its rapid and pollution-free advantages. At present, using near infrared spectroscopy to distinguish soil types, soil heavy metal pollution technology has become increasingly mature, but the soil nutrients, such as monitoring of soil organic matter, available phosphorus, available potassium, available nitrogen is still in the research stage. This paper reviews the recent research results of soil nutrients in near infrared spectrum monitoring technology based on collation, summary and key technology of common data processing method, and analysis the advantages and disadvantages of different detection methods for soil nutrient direction of near infrared spectroscopy technology put forward suggestions to further research.

TI  - Characterization of soil moisture distribution and movement under the influence of watering-dewatering using {AHFO} and {BOTDA} technologies
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - The infiltration and distribution of water through un-saturated soil determine its mechanical and hydrological properties. However, there are few methods that can accurately capture the spatial distribution of moisture inside soil. This study aims to demonstrate the use of actively heated fiber optic (AHFO) and Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) technologies for monitoring soil moisture distribution as well as strain distribution. In addition to a laboratory model test, finite element analyses were conducted to interpret the measurements. During the experiment, the fine particle migration was also measured to understand its influence on soil hydraulic conductivity. The results of the experiment indicate that (i) for a soil that has never experienced a watering-dewatering cycle, water infiltration can be accurately calculated using the Richards' equation; (ii) migration of fine soil particles caused by the watering-dewatering cycle significantly increases the hydraulic conductivity; and (iii) two critical zones (drainage and erosion) play significant roles in determining the overall hydraulic conductivity of the entire soil. This study provides a new method for monitoring the changes in soil moisture, soil strain, and hydraulic conductivity. The observations suggest that the effect of fine particles migration should be considered while evaluating soil moisture distribution and water movement. Â© 2019 Geological Society of America.

TI  - Soil nutrient loss through erosion: {Impact} of different cropping systems and soil amendments in {Ghana
VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil erosion is a multifactor threat to crop production and the environment. Most studies on soil erosion characterization have not focused on soil nutrient loss associated with erosion. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the magnitude of nutrient loss through soil erosion under different cropping systems and amendments to inform agronomic practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A field experiment was carried out on runoff plots with different cropping systems (sole maize, sole cowpea, sole maize and maize intercropped with soybean) as main plots and soil amendments (biochar, NPK (Nitrogen +Phosphorus +Potassium) fertilizer, NPK + biochar and a control (no amendment)) constituting the subplots in a randomized complete block design. For each block, a bare plot was included to assess the efficiency of the different crop and soil management practices on soil erosion. The study was carried out in three consecutive cropping seasons in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. The bare plots had the highest amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) eroded: 33.88, 12.35 and 12.75 kg ha -1 respectively followed by the control plots with magnitude of 20.43, 8.42 and 7.87 kg ha -1 respectively for N, P and K. Sole maize had the highest amounts of nutrient loss: 19.71, 8.12 and 7.27 for N, P and K respectively compared to all the other cropping systems where the losses varied respectively from 12.38 to 17.12, 6.67 to 7.49 and 5.81 to 6.75 kg ha -1 The legume-based cropping systems under inorganic fertilizer and biochar management effectively reduced nutrient loss more than all other treatment combinations. The off-site effect of soil erosion expressed as enrichment ratio (ER) was higher for all plots, which received inorganic fertilizer inputs varying from 1.93 to 3.06 while the other treatments had ERs of 1.51 to 2.03. The ERs of fine soil particles were greater than 1 (ranging from 1.14 to 3.6) being relatively higher than that of coarse particles (sand) with values below 1 (ranging from 0.62 to 0.88). The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss (30.82 US\$ ha -1 ) was observed under cowpea cropping system which received NPK + BC treatment. Soil erosion affected directly soil nutrient depletion through nutrient loss; however, integrated soil fertility management associated with legume-based cropping systems can be alternative options to reducing its effects on croplands in SSA.

TI  - Soil moisture mapping using multi-frequency and multi-coil electromagnetic induction sensors on managed podzols
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) involves the management of agricultural fields including spatial information of soil properties derived from apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements. While this approach is gaining much attention in agricultural management, farmed podzolic soils are under-represented in the relevant literature. This study: (i) established the relationship between ECa and soil moisture content (SMC) measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR); and (ii) evaluated the estimated SMC with ECa measurements obtained with two electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors, i.e., multi-coil and multi-frequency, using TDR measured SMC. Measurements were taken on several plots at Pynn's Brook Research Station, Pasadena, Newfoundland, Canada. The means of ECa measurements were calculated for the same sampling location in each plot. The linear regression models generated for SMC using the CMD-MINIEXPLORER were statistically significant with the highest R2 of 0.79 and the lowest RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.015 m3 m-3 but were not significant for GEM-2 with the lowest R2 of 0.17 and RMSE of 0.045 m3 m-3; this was due to the difference in the depth of investigation between the two EMI sensors. The validation of the SMC regression models for the two EMI sensors produced the highest R2 = 0.54 with the lowest RMSE prediction = 0.031 m3 m-3 given by CMD-MINIEXPLORER. The result demonstrated that the CMD-MINIEXPLORER based measurements better predicted shallow SMC, while deeper SMC was better predicted by GEM-2 measurements. In addition, the ECa measurements obtained through either multi-coil or multi-frequency sensors have the potential to be successfully employed for SMC mapping at the field scale.

TI  - Assessment of soil moisture information content in level-1 data from low-frequency active and passive microwave sensors
VL  - 2018-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Low-frequency microwave brightness temperature and backscatter observations are sensitive to surface soil moisture, a key variable for applications like numerical weather prediction, drought monitoring and climate modeling. With ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, two L-band radiometers dedicated to soil moisture monitoring are currently in orbit. In addition, operational soil moisture products exist based on EUMETSAT MetOp C-band advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) and JAXA GCOM-W multifrequency radiometer (AMSR2) data. This study aims to assess the information content of Level-1 data from active and passive microwave sensors for soil moisture estimation. Specific focus lies on the comparison between frequencies (Lband, C-band, X-band) and sensor types (active and passive) as well as the added value of multi-angular brightness temperature observations (e.g. from SMOS) with respect to fixed incidence angle observations. The study will provide insights into the suitability of different sensor types for soil moisture estimation irrespective of the individual Level-2 retrieval algorithm specifics. The results shall assist the definition of new observation concepts and the identification of synergies between planned or existing satellite missions. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Global estimation of soil moisture persistence with {L} and {C}-band microwave sensors
VL  - 2018-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Measurements of soil moisture are needed for a better global understanding of the land surface-climate feedbacks at both the local and the global scale. Satellite sensors operating in the low frequency microwave spectrum (from 1 to 10 GHz) have proven to be suitable for soil moisture retrievals. These sensors now cover nearly 4 decades thus allowing for global multi-mission climate data records. In this paper, we assess the possibility of using L-band (SMOS) and C-band (AMSR2, ASCAT) remotely sensed soil moisture time series for the global estimation of soil moisture persistence. A multi-output Gaussian process regression model is applied to ensure spatio-temporal coverage of the satellite data sets. It allows a robust computation of temporal autocorrelation and e-folding times. Results over a selection of catchments reveals general agreement between the response of in-situ and satellite microwave observations to hydrological processes. The response of the uppermost-modeled soil moisture layer of GLDAS-1-Noah agrees well with that of the observations, whereas major differences are displayed by MERRA2 reanalysis. The temporal dynamics of the three microwave sensors are shown to be consistent, close to in-situ and to GLDAS-1-Noah, which supports their combination for the global estimation soil moisture persistence.

TI  - Predicting spatial variations in soil nutrients with hyperspectral remote sensing at regional scale
VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - Rapid acquisition of the spatial distribution of soil nutrients holds great implications for farmland soil productivity safety, food security and agricultural management. To this end, we collected 1297 soil samples and measured the content of soil total nitrogen (TN), soil available phosphorus (AP) and soil available potassium (AK) in Zengcheng, north of the Pearl River Delta, China. Hyperspectral remote sensing images (115 bands) of the Chinese Environmental 1A satellite were used as auxiliary variables and dimensionality reduction was performed using Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis. The TN, AP and AK of soil were predicted in the study area based on auxiliary variables after dimensionality reduction, along with stepwise linear regression (SLR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models; 324 independent points were used to verify the predictive performance. The BPNN model, which demonstrated the best predictive accuracy among all methods, combined ordinary kriging (OK) with mapping the spatial variations of soil nutrients. Results show that the BPNN model with double hidden layers had better predictive accuracy for soil TN (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.409 mg kgâˆ’1, R2 = 44.24\%), soil AP (RMSE = 40.808 mg kgâˆ’1, R2 = 42.91\%) and soil AK (RMSE = 67.464 mg kgâˆ’1, R2 = 48.53\%) compared with the SLR, SVM and RF models. The back propagation neural network-ordinary kriging (BPNNOK) model showed the best predictive results of soil TN (RMSE = 0.292 mg kgâˆ’1, R2 = 68.51\%), soil AP (RMSE = 29.62 mg kgâˆ’1, R2 = 69.30\%) and soil AK (RMSE = 49.67 mg kgâˆ’1 and R2 = 70.55\%), indicating the best fitting ability between hyperspectral remote sensing bands and soil nutrients. According to the spatial mapping results of the BPNNOK model, concentrations of soil TN (north-central), soil AP (central and southwest) and soil AK (central and southeast) were respectively higher in the study area. The most important bands (464â€“517 nm) for soil TN (b10, b14, b20 and b21), soil AP (b3, b19 and b22) and soil AK (b4, b11, b12 and b25) exhibited the best response and sensitivity according to the SLR, SVM, RF and BPNN models. It was concluded that the application of hyperspectral images (visible-near-infrared data) with BPNNOK model was found to be an efficient method for mapping and monitoring soil nutrients at the regional scale.

TI  - Soil water content estimation at peat soil using {GPR} common-offset measurements
VL  - 169
SN  - NA
AB  - The appropriate of petrophysical relationship is needed for Soil Water Content (SWC) estimation especially when using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Ground penetrating radar is a geophysical tool that provides indirectly the parameter of SWC. This paper examines the performance of few published petrophysical relationships to obtain SWC estimates from in-situ GPR common-offset survey measurements with gravimetric measurements at peat soil area. Gravimetric measurements were conducted to support of GPR measurements for the accuracy assessment. Further, GPR with dual frequencies (250MHhz and 700MHz) were used in the survey measurements to obtain the dielectric permittivity. Three empirical equations (i.e. Roth's equation, Schaap's equation and Idi's equation) were selected for the study, used to compute the soil water content from dielectric permittivity of the GPR profile. The results indicate that Schaap's equation provides strong correlation with SWC as measured by GPR data sets and gravimetric measurements. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - A downscaling method for improving the spatial resolution of passive microwave derived soil moisture product based on {MODIS} data
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter to be monitored in agricultural activities. Estimation on soil moisture is as important as understanding the process of hydrology and ecology. Nowadays, how to acquire extensive soil moisture information has became the key to this problem due to insufficient performance of water models. Remote sensing technology is able to obtain essential soil moisture information on a large scale quickly and efficiently. In order to integrate high coverage of microwave data with higher spatial resolution of optical/infrared satellite data, a downscaling algorithm is evaluated for the improvement of soil moisture at temporal and spatial resolution using AMSR-E/AMSR-2 (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS/2) and MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The turbulent energy fluxes which link passive microwave derived soil moisture with several factors (eg: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST(Land Surface Temperature), albedo) at high resolution through evapotranspiration. Based on 'universal triangle method', NDVI, albedo, and LST from MODIS are used to downscale AMSR-E/AMSR-2 daily soil moisture from 25km to 1km in this study. With linear relationships between microwave soil moisture and several parameters (NDVI, LST, albedo), specific downscaling parameters of satellite images for same date which represents unique relations between soil moisture and energy flux was calculated through multivariate linear model between soil moisture at coarse resolution and several parameters(NDVI, LST, albedo). Downscaled soil moisture was obtained by calculation with downscaling parameters and NDVI, LST and albedo at higher spatial resolution. Because of discrepancy of different spatio-temporal scale between satellite date and in situ point data used in validation, we used a algorithm to rescale downscaled result to remove systematic differences. The scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and measured soil moisture in 10 cm depth from different agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia is plotted and analyzed. The performance of this algorithm is assessed by comparing the obtained daily downscaling results at 1 km with in situ soil moisture point measurement (10 cm depth) from agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia. The result showed that scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and station observation of 10 cm depth soil moisture with its bias and RMSE of -0.094 and 0.092. Results showed that downscaled soil moisture at 1km enable to represent value and variability of soil moisture content at a large scale and perform better than satellite data from single source because of higher coverage and spatial-temporal resolution.

TI  - Stability of indicators for net soil nitrogen mineralization in tobacco rotation and tillage systems
VL  - 82
SN  - NA
AB  - Measuring biological net soil nitrogen mineralization (NSNM) can assist nitrogen (N) fertility management in agroecosystems, but the time and apparatus required for this assessment limits measurement frequency. Stable NSNM predictors that could be rapidly measured to compare systems would be extremely useful. We compared the effects of crop and soil management on NSNM from 2011 to 2013 and evaluated several carbon (C) and N indices including particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil total nitrogen (STN) as NSNM indicators. Soil (0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depths) was collected from six long-term burley tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum L.) tillage and rotation systems. Net soil nitrogen mineralization was estimated by a 120-d laboratory incubation. The relative effects of management on NSNM among these systems were stable across 3 yr, which suggested NSNM measurement can be reduced to that frequency when NSNM is used to compare different crop and soil management. The soil C and N fractions contributed variably to predicting soil N mineralization in the different rotation systems, but SOC (which can be calculated from soil organic matter, a common index in the routine test package of many soil testing laboratories) was the best overall NSNM predictor in this study.

TI  - Above- and belowground nitrogen distribution of a red clover-perennial ryegrass sward along a soil nutrient availability gradient established by organic and conventional cropping systems
VL  - 425
SN  - NA
AB  - Aims: Belowground legume nitrogen (N) composed of roots and rhizodeposition is an important N input to soils, but published data of belowground N vary broadly, probably due to extrapolation from short-term experiments and dissimilar growing conditions. We quantified belowground N inputs of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) during two consecutive years in a clover-grass sward along a soil nutrient availability gradient. Methods: We established a red clover-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) model sward in microplots located in field plots of the DOK experiment, which has a 33-year history of organic and conventional cropping, resulting in a soil nutrient availability gradient. Four treatments were examined: the zero fertilisation control, bio-organic with half and full dose manure application, and the conventional system with mineral fertilisation at full dose. We studied the development of clover aboveground and belowground N using multiple pulse 15N urea leaf labelling. Results: Belowground clover N increased over time and with rising nutrient availability and was proportional to aboveground clover N at all times. Belowground clover N amounted to 40\% of aboveground clover N during two consecutive years, irrespective of the nutrient availability status. Belowground clover N development was initially dominated by fast root growth, followed by enhanced root turnover during the second year. Potassium availability limited clover growth and total N accumulation in treatments with low nutrient availability. Conclusions: Belowground red clover N inputs could be estimated from aboveground N by a constant factor of 0.4, regardless of the nutrient availability and cultivation time. Root turnover led to a distinct absolute increase of N rhizodeposition over time. Hence, N rhizodeposition, with an 80\% share of belowground N, was the predominant N pool at the end of the second year. Â© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Real-time monitoring of soil nutrient analysis using {WSN
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The agricultural yield primarily depends on soil fertility, the moisture level of soil and use of appropriate fertilisers. In the current scenario, the manual method of measuring the soil nutrients is less accurate because of the time difference of soil sample collected at the field and when it is measured in a laboratory. It becomes necessary to create a smarter agriculture practice through Internet of Things(IoT) to address this challenge. Soil nutrient analysis using wireless sensor networks (WSN) enables various application like remote monitoring of soil fertility, analysis, provide a selection of crop and build irrigation decision support systems. In the proposed system, the wireless sensors measure the macro nutrient of soil and transmit the data to the cloud. The user can view the soil fertility at the convenience on their mobile application. It is possible that the farmer may wish to grow a specific crop based on the economic interest. The software system has the intelligence to recommend the fertiliser that is required to be used to suit the needs of the desired crop, thus improving the quality of the soil and in turn, increase the yield. Overall, the proposed system helps farmers to gather real-time information about various soils, their fertility level, suggest crops and fertilisers at the convenience of the mobile app. Finally, this project effort will help farmers to make the right decision, gain better yield and economic advantage.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Nutrient elements of NPK are macro nutrients that play an important role in the growth and development of plants, therefore it is necessary to measure NPK nutrient content to measure how well soil fertility condition before the land planting period, but NPK measurement through laboratory tests takes a relatively long time. This research develops a prototype of NPK nutrient measurement system based on a mobile application by using soil image for determining the textural characteristic, the textural characteristics are processed with local binary pattern and back-propagation neural network to accelerate the measurement process.Sample data in this research was taken on rice field land in the province of Yogyakarta Special Region by varying the distance at 30 cm to 110 cm with interval 20 cm and angle image capture at-30Â° to 30Â° with interval 10Â°. Datasets were being pre-processed to improve image quality and adjust image format. Preprocessed results are extracted using local binary pattern uniform to obtain texture features. The texture features were being inputted of the neural network model, that being trained with a back-propagation algorithm by varying parameters of the neural network model.The model tested to determine the effect of distance and angle of image capture, system processing speed, and effect of artificial neural network parameters. The best model is implemented on a smartphone application. The results obtained an average of computation time 0.65s, and the optimal result is obtained at distance capture of 50 cm and angle capture of 0Â° with the measurement accuracy at each soil nutrient level of nitrogen 91.80\%, while phosphorus 83.49\%, and potassium 82.54\%, therefore the average is 84.16\% Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Comparison between capacitive and microstructured optical fiber soil moisture sensors
VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture content has always been an important parameter to control because it is a deterministic factor for site-specific irrigation, seeding, transplanting, and compaction detection. In this work, a discrete sensor that is based on a SnO2-FP (Fabry-PÃ©rot) cavity is presented and characterized in real soil conditions. As far as authors know, it is the first time that a microstructured optical fiber is used for real soil moisture measurements. Its performance is compared with a commercial capacitive soil moisture sensor in two different soil scenarios for two weeks. The optical sensor shows a great agreement with capacitive sensor's response and gravimetric measurements, as well as a fast and reversible response; moreover, the interrogation technique allows for several sensors to be potentially multiplexed, which offers the possibility of local measurements instead of volumetric: it constitutes a great tool for real soil moisture monitoring.

TI  - Integrated soil fertility management sequences for reducing climate risk in smallholder crop production systems in southern {Africa
VL  - 224
SN  - NA
AB  - Climate change, increased climate variability and poor soil fertility are major bio-physical constraints to cropping on smallholder farms in southern Africa. We used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to assess maize yield response to integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) rotational sequences of low-quality organic resources, nitrogen-fixing green manure and grain legumes, and mineral fertilizers under baseline (1960â€“2005) and projected (2040â€“2069) climates. APSIM was also employed to evaluate the response of maize yield to the ISFM sequences under a combination of a changing climate, and typical sowing dates and mineral fertilizer application rates for smallholder households of varying resource endowment. The ISFM sequences were â€˜Fertilizer-startâ€™ [a sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea (L.)-based sequence], â€˜Litter-startâ€™ (a woodland litter-based sequence), and â€˜Soya-startâ€™ and â€˜Manure-startâ€™ (cattle manure-based sequences). The simulated maize grain yields were used to analyze agronomic and economic risks of maize productivity. Agronomic risk was evaluated on the basis of sufficiency of the maize grain yield to meet annual household calorie (energy) requirements, while economic risk was assessed using gross margins. For model evaluation, the simulated maize yields compared well with those measured from the field experiment (RMSE = 0.11â€“0.55; R2 = 0.55â€“0.93). Under the baseline climate, â€˜Soya-startâ€™ was the least risky ISFM option as only one (2.2\%) of the 45 years had calories lower than the minimum acceptable limit of 4,872,750 kcal required to meet household food self-sufficiency for a family of six people. Conversely, continuous fertilized maize and â€˜Litter-startâ€™ were the most risky options among the fertilized treatments as three (6.7\%) and four (8.9\%) of the 45 years, respectively, yielded calories that were below the threshold. Across treatments, the number of years with maize grain yield exceeding 2.3 t haâˆ’1 was higher under baseline compared with future climate. However, â€˜Soya-startâ€™ and â€˜Manure-startâ€™ were consistently the least risky options under the future climate. The cattle manure-based sequences also had the lowest economic risk under both baseline and future climates. Over the 45-year period under baseline climate, â€˜Soya-startâ€™ only had two years with negative gross margins compared with six and nine for â€˜Litter-startâ€™ and continuous fertilized maize, respectively. A similar trend was observed under future climate. Overall, agronomic risk was lowest under sowing dates and mineral fertilizer application rates for resource-endowed (RG1) farmers compared with their resource-constrained (RG3) counterparts. Agronomic risk was higher under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 compared with RCP4.5, with an average increase of 6, 4 and 6\% for RG1, resource-intermediate (RG2) and RG3 management, respectively. Under the typical farmer management practices, the cattle manure-based sequences gave lower agronomic risk than continuous fertilized maize. Economic risk under the farmer management scenarios overly mirrored trends observed for agronomic risk. We conclude that sequenced ISFM combinations of organic resources, nitrogen-fixing green manure and grain legumes, and mineral fertilizers reduce climate risk in smallholder rainfed crop production systems in southern Africa, and similar agroecologies.

TI  - Research and application of a new soil moisture sensor
VL  - 175
SN  - NA
AB  - The measurement of soil moisture is the basis for the refinement of agriculture to implement water-saving irrigation. A new soil moisture sensor was designed based on its theoretical basis and analysis of the dielectric constant characteristics of soil. It mainly consists of probes, electronic circuits and wiring cables. The calibration test of the sensor was conducted under the working voltage of 2.5 5.5V. Using the experimental data to analyze the regression function, it was found that the output voltage of the sensor should have a linear negative correlation with the volumetric moisture content of the soil, and the coefficient of determination R2{\textgreater}0.986.The accuracy of the sensor was verified by soil samples with different moisture content. The average absolute value of absolute errors is less than 2.5\%. The results show that the sensor has stable and reliable working performance, high measurement accuracy and good linearity, and is suitable for moisture measurement in most types of soil.

AB  - The validation research is the basis of application of remote sensing data. This study using soil surface measured data for 10 cm in Northeast China in 1992-2013 to verify the European space agency soil moisture data set (ESA CCI SM). In this study, two methods evaluating CCI data for revealing drought was used: common Pearson coefficient method and drought judgement method for coincidence degree of drought. This verification study is located in the main grain producing areas of Northeast China, which is dominated by rain-fed agriculture. After the result analysis, CCI remote sensing soil moisture is feasible for assessment research on agricultural drought. Through the evaluation of this study, this remote sensing soil water can be used as an effective indicator of agricultural drought in the main grain-producing region of Northeast China.

TI  - Studies and application of remote sensing retrieval method of soil moisture content in land parcel units in irrigation area
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the important hydrological elements. Obtaining soil moisture accurately and effectively is of great significance for water resource management in irrigation area. During the process of soil moisture content retrieval with multiremote sensing data, multi-remote sensing data always brings multi-spatial scale problems which results in inconformity of soil moisture content retrieved by remote sensing in different spatial scale. In addition, agricultural water use management has suitable spatial scale of soil moisture information so as to satisfy the demands of dynamic management of water use and water demand in certain unit. We have proposed to use land parcel unit as the minimum unit to do soil moisture content research in agricultural water using area, according to soil characteristics, vegetation coverage characteristics in underlying layer, and hydrological characteristic into the basis of study unit division. We have proposed division method of land parcel units. Based on multi thermal infrared and near infrared remote sensing data, we calculate the ndvi and tvdi index and make a statistical model between the tvdi index and soil moisture of ground monitoring station. Then we move forward to study soil moisture remote sensing retrieval method on land parcel unit scale. And the method has been applied in Hetao irrigation area. Results show that compared with pixel scale the soil moisture content in land parcel unit scale has displayed stronger correlation with true value. Hence, remote sensing retrieval method of soil moisture content in land parcel unit scale has shown good applicability in Hetao irrigation area. We converted the research unit into the scale of land parcel unit. Using the land parcel units with unified crops and soil attributes as the research units more complies with the characteristics of agricultural water areas, avoids the problems such as decomposition of mixed pixels and excessive dependence on high-resolution data caused by the research units of pixels, and doesn't involve compromises in the spatial scale and simulating precision like the grid simulation. When the application needs are met, the production efficiency of products can also be improved at a certain degree. Â© Authors 2018. CC BY 4.0 License.

AB  - Nowadays, even if the â€œmachine learningâ€ term has degenerated into a buzz-word, it encloses a large framework of techniques that has recently demonstrated a disruptive change of the performance in a large number of application, thanks to the increased amount of data and novel approaches to treat them. Some parts of these framework (such as multivariate analysis) have been known since a long time, however they have been rediscovered and improved thanks to this new application trend. In this paper we will show how the extraction of the information in sensing could be dramatically improved on the basis of multivariate analysis techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities in a novel compact implementation of a soil moisture sensor based on a contactless microwave impedance spectroscopy technique. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Simultaneous adoption of integrated soil fertility management technologies in the {Chinyanja} {Triangle}, {Southern} {Africa
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Empirical scientific evidence indicates that there is still room for increasing food production by improving land productivity. This study aimed at identifying the key determinants that govern farmersâ€™ decisions to adopt multiple components of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in a maize mixed cropping system of the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. Revealed preferences of ISFM components were collected from 320 randomly selected households and multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyse the simultaneous effects on adoption based on biophysical plot and household-level socioeconomic attributes. The results show that farmersâ€™ choices of a set of ISFM components are determined by a mix of factors that address the trade-offs and synergies among them. Non-farm income, moderate land quality perception, and education influence simultaneous technology adoption, while gender and crop loss increase the likelihood of farmersâ€™ decisions to adopt independent options. Having other sources of income supports co-adoption of inorganic fertilizer, residue incorporation, and crop rotation. Input/output market access, access to information, financial sources, and climate variability also play pivotal role in technology adoption. These results indicate that resource availability, learning costs, finances, and risk aversion need to be considered when designing and promoting ISFM technologies as a package.

TI  - Soil fertility appraisal for {Villupuram} {District} of {Tamil} {Nadu} using {GPS} and {GIS} techniques
VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - With a view to assess and map the soil fertility status of Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu, the present investigation was undertaken using GPS and GIS techniques. In this study, a systematic set of 864 georeferenced soil samples were collected from 144 selected villages, covering all the eight taluks and 22 blocks following multistage stratified random sampling approach. The soil samples were analyzed for 12 chemical parameters and the data along with GPS readings were used for the preparation of soil fertility maps using GIS. The soil fertility maps clearly revealed that a major area of the district was alkaline, non-saline, low in OC, low, high and medium in available N, P and K, respectively; with regard to available S and micronutrients, Zn was predominantly deficient and Cu was moderate while S, Fe, Mn and B were in sufficient status. As a whole, OC, available N, Zn and Cu are the major nutrient constraints in Villupuram district which warrants attention for implementing soil test crop response based nutrient recommendations through integrated plant nutrition system (STCR-IPNS) and application of corresponding micronutrients. Based on the soil fertility appraisal of the district, nutrient plan for various taluks has been furnished for implementation. Â© 2018, IndianJournals.com. All rights reserved.

TI  - Direct and residual effect of various vermicompost on soil nutrient and nutrient uptake dynamics and productivity of four mustard {Pak}-{Coi} ({Brassica} rapa {L}.) sequences in organic farming system
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Purpose: To study the direct effect on the first mustard cropping and the residual effect of three kinds of vermicompost on the productivity of the second, third, fourth Pak-Coi mustard sequential cropping. Method: A field experiment was conducted for four sequential planting periods of mustard Pak-Coi in silty clay Inceptisol. The experiment used a factorial randomized block design with two factors. Factor I comprised three kinds of vermicompost with three types of bedding materials; V1â€”spent mushroom waste, V2â€”coconut husk, and V3â€”sugarcane trash, while factor II comprised four different application rates: 5, 10, 15, and 20 t haâˆ’1. From these two factors, there were 12 treatments plus one control treatment (without vermicompost application). Results: Application of vermicompost increased soil NPK content. The highest nutrient uptake was also found in the residual effect for the second cropping. Nutrient uptake of the third and fourth mustard cropping had a decreasing trend. The highest yield on the first cropping was found in the application of vermicompost V2 and V1 with the application rates of 10â€“15 t haâˆ’1. In the second cropping, the productivity increased, whereas the third and fourth sequential cropping decreased in the vermicompost V1 and V2, whereas in the vermicompost V3 the productivity of the third and fourth cropping was slightly increased. Conclusion: The application of vermicompost to organic farming provides nutrient availability in four mustard subsequent planting periods. Differences in the dynamics of nutrient availability, nutrient uptake and crop yields are affected by the vermicompost materials used. Â© 2018, The Author(s).

VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - Measurements of soil water content are of great importance for climatic researches and hydrological applications. Satellite remote sensing techniques have provided convenient access to global soil moisture data at high temporal resolution. The evaluation of remotely sensed soil moisture products from multiple sensors are fundamental for understanding the quality and usefulness of the products and are helpful for the improvements of the retrieval algorithms. In this study, we evaluated four satellite-based soil moisture products against two in situ networks over continental U.S. These products are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Fengyun-3B/Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI), and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture products. The evaluation results show that the temporal characteristics of ECV and SMOS soil moisture products are consistent with those of in situ measurements. Larger errors and bias exist in AMSR-E and FY-3B/MWRI over the study region. In general, the ECV product performs the best comparing with other products. Therefore, the ECV product is recommended in regional hydrological applications and water resource management over the continental U.S. for its good performance in absolute values and soil moisture anomalies.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval using convolutional neural networks: {Application} to passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - A empirical model is established to analyse the daily retrieval of soil moisture from passive microwave remote sensing using convolutional neural networks (CNN). soil moisture plays an important role in the water cycle. However, with the rapidly increasing of the acquiring technology for remotely sensed data, it's a hard task for remote sensing practitioners to find a fast and convenient model to deal with the massive data. In this paper, the AMSR-E brightness temperatures are used to train CNN for the prediction of the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts (ECMWF) model. Compared with the classical inversion methods, the deep learning-based method is more suitable for global soil moisture retrieval. It is very well supported by graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, which can meet the demand of massive data inversion. Once the model trained, a global soil moisture map can be predicted in less than 10 seconds. What's more, the method of soil moisture retrieval based on deep learning can learn the complex texture features from the big remote sensing data. In this experiment, the results demonstrates that the CNN deployed to retrieve global soil moisture can achieve a better performance than the support vector regression (SVR) for soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Tree legumes-temperate grass agroforestry system effects on inorganic soil nitrogen as ecosystem services provision for smallholder farming systems in {South} {Africa
VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential macro-nutrient for plant growth and is indispensable for high agricultural food productivity and quality. Shortage of good quality forage under the dry winter season and low soil fertility conditions are the major constraints in rural farming systems in the Moist Tall Grassveld of the Upper Thukela, South Africa. The effect of legumes on inorganic soil nitrogen was assessed in an agroforestry trial (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit, Acacia karroo Hayne, Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), by soil sampling method. In the agroforestry trial, total inorganic soil nitrogen accumulation was significantly greater under intercropping than under sole crop treatments and, irrespective of the treatments, significantly more nitrate than ammonium nitrogen was measured. The study demonstrated that intercropping grasses with tree legumes could provide important ecosystem services of nitrogen supply in the soil. The results suggested that introducing legume intercrops might constitute a relevant cropping strategy to improve the soil fertility status with regard to nitrogen while at the same time providing forage in smallholder farming systems in South Africaâ€™s Moist Tall Grassveld regions.

TI  - Effect of different set-aside management systems on soil nematode community and soil fertility in {North}, {Central} and {South} {Italy
VL  - 261
SN  - NA
AB  - The current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2014â€“2020 of the European Union (EU) proposed some environmental attempts to contrast the biodiversity decline and mitigate the effects of intensive agricultural management systems. In the present work, the results of the effectiveness of set-aside management to enhance soil nematode biodiversity and soil fertility are reported. In a mid-term experimental trial, three different set-aside managements, with mowing in May or July and without mowing, were compared through conventional rotation to provide management indications in the context of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) Standard 4.2 in fields located in three sites (North, Central and South Italy). Soil fertility was evaluated by determining available phosphorous, total organic carbon and carbon humification. Soil nematode diversity was explored by examining soil nematode community structure, assessing Maturity (MI), Plant Parasitic (PPI), Basal (BI), Enrichment (EI), Structure (SI), Channel (CI) indices and diversity-weighted abundance. The results indicated that set-aside management moderately increased the available phosphorous and organic carbon content and humification remained low; the greatest increase in organic matter was obtained with mowing in May, period not permitted by Standard 4.2. The set-aside efficiency was associated with the previous crop rotations, and the major advantages were found after intensive crop rotations. In general, under set-aside management the nematode colonizer species, mainly bacterivores, increased in abundance and richness while plant parasitic nematodes and predators remained constant. Mowing carried out in July (the permitted period by Standard 4.2), weakly improved the soil nematode community structure by increasing k-strategies within nematode populations. Interestingly, the indices confirm that shifts in nematode community composition occurred more as a result of previous management than of five years of set-aside managements: specifically, the site characterized by the longest and the most conservative rotation, showed the highest values in MI, PPI, EI, SI indices. The use of diversity-weighted abundance expressed as biomass showed that free living nematodes involved in nutrient mineralization (bacterial and fungal feeders) and plant parasitic nematodes are not efficiently regulated by predation. Finally, as many nematode families are affected by soil organic carbon content, the low organic carbon increases found under set-aside management systems likely determined a low improvement of soil nematode biodiversity.

TI  - Short-term fallow in extensive upland shifting cultivation systems of {Northern} {Lao} {PDR}: {Its} role in soil fertility restoration
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Shifting cultivation, a land use strategy of often resource-poor households, centers around the management practice of leaving land fallow for up to 20 years to restore soil fertility. Global pressures, for example, conservation policies or population increase, are in some areas restricting fallow duration to lengths theoretically considered insufficient for soil fertility restoration, which has however been difficult to document empirically. Thus, our main objective was to explore the role of short-term fallow in soil fertility restoration in a shifting cultivation system in Northern Lao PDR with a 4-year longitudinal study of nine upland fields left fallow after a single upland rice cropping. During the first fallow year, surface soil carbon, nitrogen, and permanganate-oxidizable carbon (Pox-C) levels increased an average of 1.06\%, 0.06\%, and 169 mg kgâˆ’1, respectively, after which levels plateau or decline. This trend is ascribed to the organic material input from crop residue and fallow vegetation and was not observed at a 10 cm depth where the major source of organic material is root residue. At this depth, carbon and nitrogen levels gradually declined with an increase only during the second fallow year. It is concluded that the fallowing effect on carbon sequestration, and indirectly soil fertility, depends on how far a soil is removed from its inherent carbon equilibrium level and sequestration capacity. Furthermore, we find that although Pox-C likely reflects a labile soil carbon pool, the advantage lies with the method itself as it requires low resources, thus has potential for locally based monitoring of soil fertility.

TI  - Biochar application for the improving soil fertility and paddy production on two systems of planting
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - A product of pyrolysis of residual biomass called biochar has several benefits into soil. Bio-charcoal formed by burning organic waste which will produce activated carbon and organic carbon and will be added to the soil. The purpose of this study was to evaluate biochar ability to improve soil fertility and increase the production of paddy crops with two planting systems. Legowo planting system is intermittent cropping between two or more rows of rice plants and one empty row. The research was conducted in Tanjung Garbus's Village, Deli Serdang District with an elevation of Â± 50 Meters above sea level. This research used a Factorial Split Plot Design with two factors that was treatment of planting systems as main plot (S), consist of 2 (two) stages: Jajar Legowo 2:1 and Jajar Legowo 4:1 and the sub-plot was biochar application (B) consisting of 3 levels namely, without biochar application, 25.5 ton/ha, and 50.5 ton/ha. The results showed that planting system significantly affected shoot wet weight and shoot dry weight and biochar application had a significant effect on shoot wet weight and no significant effect on shoot dry weight. The interaction showed no significant effect on all parameters. Â© 2018 Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences.

TI  - Impact of sewage sludge application on soil fertility, microbial population and enzyme activities in soil under rice-wheat system
VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - A field experiment was conducted at Agricultural Research Farm, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India for two consecutive years taking two crops each of rice and wheat in a sequence to study the effect of one time application of sewage sludge (SS) on soil fertility, microbial population and enzyme activities. Graded levels of SS were applied along with 50 and 100\% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF). The experiment was conducted in randomized block design taking 10 treatments with three replications. The soil pH decreased, while electrical conductivity (EC) and organic carbon (OC) content increased due to addition of SS. Application of SS in first crop and its residual effect in subsequent crops increased the available N, P, K and S content in soil. Higher available P was recorded in the second crop of the experiment, whereas, available K was high in third crop. Microbial colony count (bacterial and fungal) and enzyme activities (urease, phosphatase and dehydrogenase) were significantly increased due to application of SS resulting in higher microbial activity in post-harvest soils with 45 t ha -1 SS. Sewage sludge added during previous years had pronounced residual influence on soil fertility and microbial activity. Â© 2018, IndianJournals.com. All rights reserved.

TI  - N2-fixation and {N} contribution by grain legumes under different soil fertility status and cropping systems in the {Guinea} savanna of northern {Ghana
VL  - 261
SN  - NA
AB  - Continuous cereal-based cropping has led to a rapid decline in soil fertility in the Guinea savanna agro-ecological zone of northern Ghana with corresponding low crop yields. We evaluated the effects of cropping system and soil fertility status on grain yields and N2-fixation by grain legumes and net N contribution to soil fertility improvement in contrasting sites in this agro-ecological zone. Maize was intercropped with cowpea, soybean and groundnut within a row, with a maize stand alternated with two equally spaced cowpea or groundnut stands and in the maize-soybean system, four equally spaced soybean stands. These intercrops were compared with sole crops of maize, cowpea, soybean and groundnut in fertile and poorly fertile fields at sites in the southern (SGS) and the northern (NGS) Guinea savanna. The proportion of N derived from N2-fixation (\%Ndfa) was comparable between intercrops and sole crops. However, the amount of N2-fixed was significantly larger in sole crops due to a greater biomass accumulation. Legumes in poorly fertile fields had significantly smaller shoot Î´15N enrichment (âˆ’2.8 to +0.7â€°) and a larger \%Ndfa (55â€“94\%) than those in fertile fields (âˆ’0.8 to +2.2â€°; 23â€“85\%). The N2-fixed however was larger in fertile fields (16â€“145 kg N haâˆ’1) than in poorly fertile fields (15â€“123 kg N haâˆ’1) due to greater shoot dry matter and N yields. The legumes grown in the NGS obtained more of their N requirements from atmospheric N2-fixation (73â€“88\%) than legumes grown in the SGS (41â€“69\%). The partial soil N balance (in kg haâˆ’1) was comparable between intercrops (âˆ’14 to 21) and sole legumes (âˆ’8 to 23) but smaller than that of sole maize receiving N fertiliser (+7 to +34). With other N inputs (aerial deposition) and outputs (leaching and gaseous losses) unaccounted for, there is uncertainty surrounding the actual amount of soil N balances of the cropping systems, indicating that partial N balances are not reliable indicators of the sustainability of cropping systems. Nevertheless, the systems with legumes seem more attractive due to several non-N benefits. Our results suggest that soybean could be targeted in the SGS and cowpea in the NGS for greater productivity while groundnut is suited to both environments. Grain legumes grown in poorly fertile fields contributed more net N to the soil but growing legumes in fertile fields seems more lucrative due to greater grain and stover yields and non-N benefits.

TI  - Smsynth: {An} imagery synthesis system for soil moisture retrieval
VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a important variable in various research areas, such as weather and climate forecasting, agriculture, drought and flood monitoring and prediction, and human health. An ongoing challenge in estimating SM via synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the development of the retrieval SM methods, especially the empirical models needs as training samples a lot of measurements of SM and soil roughness parameters which are very difficult to acquire. As such, it is difficult to develop empirical models using realistic SAR imagery and it is necessary to develop methods to synthesis SAR imagery. To tackle this issue, a SAR imagery synthesis system based on the SM named SMSynth is presented, which can simulate radar signals that are realistic as far as possible to the real SAR imagery. In SMSynth, SAR backscatter coefficients for each soil type are simulated via the Oh model under the Bayesian framework, where the spatial correlation is modeled by the Markov random field (MRF) model. The backscattering coefficients simulated based on the designed soil parameters and sensor parameters are added into the Bayesian framework through the data likelihood where the soil parameters and sensor parameters are set as realistic as possible to the circumstances on the ground and in the validity range of the Oh model. In this way, a complete and coherent Bayesian probabilistic framework is established. Experimental results show that SMSynth is capable of generating realistic SAR images that suit the needs of a large amount of training samples of empirical models. Â© Authors 2018.

AB  - There is a lack of information about the effects of interactions among lime, phosphogypsum (PG) and fertilization on soil fertility and their effects on common bean yields in the tropics. This study aimed to determine the effects of annual application of PG and limestone and rates of fertilization on the chemical attributes of soil, fertilization efficiency, yield components and the grain yield of the common bean. The study was performed for three growing seasons in an acidic Oxisol. The experimental design was randomized blocks in a 4x4 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of lime, lime + PG, PG, and control (without corrective application) with four fertilization rates. In an acidic and low-fertility Cerrado soil, limestone or limestone + PG applied annually at 1/3 of the total rate in a no tillage system increased the common bean yield and the efficiency of the fertilization, although the improvement of the soil acidity indicators did not reach the desired levels. The application of soluble fertilizers to provide adequate and balanced amounts of nutrients provided greater yield gains and improved soil fertility compared to surface liming without fertilization, but the combination of the two practices resulted in the greatest benefits to both plant and soil fertility.

VL  - 462
SN  - NA
AB  - Sensing of soil nutrient content has become an integral part of soil fertility management system. Fertilizers have been in use for enhancing soil fertility since nineteenth century, but accurately applying fertilizers based on the amount required for a particular site or type of soil/crop has always remained a challenge. Moreover, standard laboratory analyses are very time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we developed a simple sensing system employing six LEDs (380, 475, 510, 570, 650, and 840Ã‚ nm) and corresponding photodetector array for obtaining the diffused reflectance from five successive positions (separated by 72Â°). Based on this reflectance data obtained from the sensing system, unique soil spectral signatures were obtained and analyzed statistically. Two mathematical models, transformed multilinear regression model named as SSRC and exponential regression model named as ERMIR, were developed for rapid non-destructive estimation of soil nitrogen based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using Vis-NIR sensing. Both the modelsâ€™ performances were analyzed based on the three statistical parameters R2, RMSE, and SEE. The R2 values obtained were almost near to 1, and the RMSE and SEE values were satisfactory. The repeatability and stability of the sensing system was also checked and found to be very satisfactory. Â© 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Comparison and downscale of {AMSR2} soil moisture products with {In} situ measurements from the {SCAN}-{NRCS} network over {Puerto} {Rico
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - A continuous spatio-temporal database of accurate soil moisture (SM) measurements is an important asset for agricultural activities, hydrologic studies, and environmental monitoring. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), which was launched in May 2012, has been providing SM data globally with a revisit period of two days. It is imperative to assess the quality of this data before performing any application. Since resources of accurate SM measurements are very limited in Puerto Rico, this research will assess the quality of the AMSR2 data by comparing it with ground-based measurements, as well as perform a downscaling technique to provide a better description of how the sensor perceives the surface soil moisture as it passes over the island. The comparison consisted of the evaluation of the mean error, root mean squared error, and the correlation coefficient. Two downscaling techniques were used, and their performances were studied. The results revealed that AMSR2 products tend to underestimate soil moisture. This is due to the extreme heterogeneous distributions of elevations, vegetation densities, soil types, and weather events on the island. This research provides a comprehensive study on the accuracy and potential of the AMSR2 products over Puerto Rico. Further studies are recommended to improve the AMSR2 products.

TI  - Belowground interactions impact the soil bacterial community, soil fertility, and crop yield in maize/peanut intercropping systems
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Intercropping has been widely used to control disease and improve yield in agriculture. In this study, maize and peanut were used for non-separation intercropping (NS), semi-separation intercropping (SS) using a nylon net, and complete separation intercropping (CS) using a plastic sheet. In field experiments, two-year land equivalent ratios (LERs) showed yield advantages due to belowground interactions when using NS and SS patterns as compared to monoculture. In contrast, intercropping without belowground interactions (CS) showed a yield disadvantage. Meanwhile, in pot experiments, belowground interactions (found in NS and SS) improved levels of soil-available nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and enzymes (urease and acid phosphomonoesterase) as compared to intercropping without belowground interactions (CS). Soil bacterial community assay showed that soil bacterial communities in the NS and SS crops clustered together and were considerably different from the CS crops. The diversity of bacterial communities was significantly improved in soils with NS and SS. The abundance of beneficial bacteria, which have the functions of P-solubilization, pathogen suppression, and N-cycling, was improved in maize and peanut soils due to belowground interactions through intercropping. Among these bacteria, numbers of Bacillus, Brevibacillus brevis, and Paenibacillus were mainly increased in the maize rhizosphere. Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Rhizobium were mainly increased in the peanut rhizosphere. In conclusion, using maize and peanut intercropping, belowground interactions increased the numbers of beneficial bacteria in the soil and improved the diversity of the bacterial community, which was conducive to improving soil nutrient (N and P) supply capacity and soil microecosystem stability.

TI  - A novel soil nutrient classification method based on hadoop platform
VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper aims to develop an effective massive data mining method for the processing of agricultural dataset. For this purpose, the k-means algorithm was improved for soil fertility analysis based on the Hadoop platform. The improvement mainly targets such defects of the k-means algorithm as the sensitivity to the initial central points and the proneness to local optimum trap. Specifically, the divisive analysis algorithm was adopted to integrate sub-clusters with high similarities and derive the final clustering results, and the max-min distance criterion was adopted to calculate the distance between the object and the cluster centre. After that, each dataset was multiplied by a weight in the dimension, and the initial centre point was selected for clustering. Next, the proposed algorithm was applied to soil fertility analysis and experimental comparison. The results show that the improved k-means algorithm enjoys a small error, strong tracking ability, fast convergence and good anti-noise ability. The research findings provide new insights into effectively soil nutrient classification. Â© 2018 Lavoisier.

SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring the soil moisture level of crop fields is one of the most important things to do for having an optimal crop yield. In this paper we investigate the capabilities of Sentinel-1 to soil moisture states. Aspects of modeling the map of soil moisture by the radar scene from Sentinel-1 on the example of a territory having undergone intensive precipitation have been considered. Representations of the territory with the radar and multispectral imaging are compared. Besides the meteorological satellite images and data of weather stations, additional verifying multispectral space images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A were used. With the use of the obtained empirical model it became possible to build maps of soil moisture of the research territory for different times.

TI  - Correlation of extractable soil phosphorus ({P}) with plant {P} uptake: 14 extraction methods applied to 50 agricultural soils from {Central} {Europe
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - The aim of this study was to test different soil phosphorus (P) extraction methods in relation to plant P uptake. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted with spring wheat. The soils were extracted with the following methods/extractants: H2O, CaCl2, LiCl, iron oxide impregnated filter papers (Fe-oxide Pi), Olsen, calcium-acetate-lactate (CAL), cation and anion exchange membranes (CAEM), Mehlich 3, Bray and Kurtz II (Bray II), citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite, organic P, HCl, acid ammonium oxalate, total P. Plant P uptake was in the range of the P extracted by neutral salt solutions (CaCl2, LiCl). P extracted with H2O, CaCl2 and CAEM correlated best with plant P uptake over one growing season, while several established soil P test methods, including CAL, Mehlich 3 and Bray II, did not show significant correlations. When grouping the soils according to pH, the weaker extraction methods (H2O, CaCl2, LiCl) showed significant correlations with plant P uptake only for the low and intermediate pH groups (pH in 1 mol/L KCl â‰¤ 6.6), while some of the stronger extraction methods (CAL, Mehlich 3, Bray II, dithionite, oxalate, total P) showed significant correlations only for the high pH group ({\textgreater} 6.6) comprised of calcareous soils. It was concluded that weaker P extraction methods, especially neutral salt solutions best predict plant-available P in the short term. However, they do not perform well for calcareous (and clayey) soils and do not account for P that may become available beyond one growing season. Â© 2018, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Remote sensing of soil moisture using {P}-band signals of opportunity ({SoOp}): {Initial} results
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Initial results from the first airborne campaign to evaluate P-band reflectometry for soil moisture remote sensing are presented. P-band radiation has a penetration depth of 10-20 cm, compared to around 5 cm for L-band. This offers the possibility of measuring Root-Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM), a capability that does not presently exist in spaceborne remote sensing. Signals of Opportunity Airborne Demonstrator (SoOp-AD) is a brassboard P-band reflectometry demonstration instrument, developed under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program (IIP-13). Soil reflectivity is estimated from the cross-correlation of direct and reflected signals from a geostationary communication satellite. SoOp-AD will demonstrate key technological advancements on the roadmap to a spaceborne instrument, including an FPGA-based correlator array and â€œsmart antennaâ€ null-steering in the post-processing stage. The first airborne tests of SoOp-AD were conducted around the ARS Micronet in Little Washita, OK. Initial results confirm the assumption of coherent scattering, show the water-land transition over Lake Ellsworth, and present reasonable values for reflectivity over the instrumented area.

TI  - Multitemporal soil moisture monitoring by use of optical remote sensing data in a dike relocation area
VL  - 10783
SN  - NA
AB  - The nature restoration project Ã¢â‚¬ Lenzener Elbtalaue', realised from 2002 to 2011 at the river Elbe, included the first large scale dike relocation in Germany (420 ha). Its aim was to initiate the development of endangered natural wetland habitats and processes, accompanied by greater biodiversity in the former grassland dominated area. The monitoring of spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture in this dike relocation area is therefore particularly important for estimating the restoration success. The topsoil moisture monitoring from 1990 to 2017 is based on the Soil Moisture Index (SMI)1 derived with the triangle method2 by use of optical remotely sensed data: land surface temperature and Normalized Differnce Vegetation Index are calculated from Landsat 4/5/7/8 data and atmospheric corrected by use of MODIS data. Spatial and temporal soil moisture variations in the restored area of the dike relocation are compared to the agricultural and pasture area behind the new dike. Ground truth data in the dike relocation area was obtained from field measurements in October 2017 with a FDR device. Additionally, data from a TERENO soil moisture sensor network (SoilNet) and mobile cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) rover measurements are compared to the results of the triangle method for a region in the Harz Mountains (Germany). The SMI time series illustrates, that the dike relocation area has become significantly wetter between 1990 and 2017, due to restructuring measurements. Whereas the SMI of the dike hinterland reflects constant and drier conditions. An influence of climate is unlikely. However, validation of the dimensionless index with ground truth measurements is very difficult, mostly due to large differences in scale. Â© SPIE.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and the horizontal structure of three demonstration units of Agroforestry Systems (ASs), Sapucaia, RJ, Brazil. Twenty-four plots (25 m2) were delineated in each AS. Soil fertility was evaluated through pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The estimated phytosociological parameters were frequency, density, dominance, importance value and the diversity index of Shannon. Magnesium was more pronounced in ASas with more management intensity due to the incorporation of banana biomass (AS 1 and 2). The AS 1 highlights were for banana and coffee (about 45\% IV), AS 2 banana and physic nuts (about 50\% IV) and AS 3 cassava and â€˜fumo-bravoâ€™ (VI=52.2\%). This study suggests that diversity contributes to the maintenance of ecosystem services on a local scale, mainly for the conservation and maintenance of soil fertility, as well as to increase food security in the property. The use of physic nuts has not shown to be a favorable option as a source of energy for the farm studied. However, it can contribute to the increase of local value added. These responses support the importance of ASs for the establishment of more sustainable production models. Â© 2018, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soil fertility and nutrient budget after 23-years of different soil tillage systems and winter cover crops in a subtropical {Oxisol
VL  - 308
SN  - NA
AB  - Growing cover crops to recycle soil nutrients in no-tillage systems provide nutrients accumulation in more labile forms in the soil surface reducing the demand for fertilizers. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term (23-yrs) effect of soil tillage systems and winter cover crops on (i) soil acidity, (ii) nutrient availability, and (iii) P and K budget in a subtropical Oxisol from Southern Brazil. The experiment was established in 1986 with six winter treatments (blue lupine, hairy vetch, oat, radish, wheat, and fallow) and two tillage systems (conventional tillage - CT and no-tillage - NT) in a very clayey Rhodic Hapludox in Southern Brazil. Nutrient availability (P, K, Ca, and Mg) and soil acidity (pH, potential acidity, base and Al saturation) were evaluated in five soil depths (0â€“5, 5â€“10, 10â€“20, 20â€“30, and 30â€“40 cm). Nutrient budget was calculated considering the inputs (amount of P and K applied via fertilizer) and outputs of P and K from the system (exported by the grains), and the soil available P and K before and after 23-years of experiment. Continuous NT system for 23-years resulted in higher soil fertility in the topsoil (0â€“10 cm) compared to CT, but with some limitations of nutrient availability and soil acidity below 10 cm depth. Long-term NT builds up a strong gradient of nutrient availability, with higher concentration of nutrients on the soil surface layers that abruptly decrease with soil depth, unlike CT. Surface application of lime in NT reduced soil acidity up to 20 cm compared to CT. The budget of P was negative for all treatments, highlighting the P-sink behavior of this strongly weathered subtropical Oxisol. However, NT system resulted in less negative budget compared to CT and, therefore, higher efficiency of use of P. Growing cover crops in the winter is effective to increase P and K availability through plant cycling, but the plants grown in winter did not affect soil acidity. Nutrient cycling by winter cover crops reduced P and K losses, especially when the soil is not plowed. Fallow in the winter decreases the use efficiency of P and K. Among the cover crops tested, black oat stood out by its greater production of biomass, resulting in higher P and K availability in the soil surface. Lupine resulted in a greater cycling of P possibly due to its ability to absorb P from less labile forms in the soil. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A new non-parametric {Bayesian} based space upscaling method for in-situ soil moisture sampling
VL  - 2017-November
SN  - NA
AB  - In soil moisture remote sensing products ground verification, the soil moisture in-situ sampling is heterogeneous and not consistent with the remote sensing pixel scale. So, it is very important that extensive sampling soil moisture of the surface heterogeneous and effective upscaling multi-point in situ soil moisture to remote sensing pixel scale. However, it is very difficult to collect them extensively if the soil moisture signal is complicated or dynamically changing. Considering the sparsity of soil moisture and the effects of observation noise, this paper models the linear programming problem between the soil moisture remote sensing pixel and in-situ sampling data using hierarchical non-parametric Bayesian linear regression. This model does not assume that the specific distribution of regression parameters which will be learned adaptively by the nonparametric Bayesian method. In addition, we implement the Dirichlet process to exploit the spatial similarity of the in-situ sampling data of soil moisture, thus to improve the spatial upscaling accuracy. Due to the Dirichlet process without explicit mathematical expression, the model of the posteriori probability distribution is very hard to deal with. To this end, the Gibbs sampling scheme based on MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) is adopted to infer the optimal regression weighting coefficient, and the spatial scale of the soil moisture in situ sampling is effectively upscaled. The experimental results show that the spatial upscaling method of nonparametric Bayesian linear regression is closer to the observed remote sensing pixel scale and better than the state of the art Bayesian method and Kriging method.

TI  - Organic strawberry in {Mediterranean} greenhouse: {Effect} of different production systems on soil fertility and fruit quality
VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - In Europe, the lack of specific rules regulating organic vegetable production in protected conditions has led to the implementation of extremely diversified systems of production, at different level of intensification. In this study, we compared three strawberry organic production systems based on the following main criteria of soil fertility management: input substitution (SB), a simplified system of organic production that mimics conventional agricultural practices and two systems characterized by a more complex soil fertility management, based on the introduction, in the rotation of agroecological service crops (ASCs) and compost (AC), and of ASCs and cattle manure (AM). Strawberry yields, in the compared systems, were not significantly different in both years of our research, while, as a whole, the yield in 2013 (30.3 Mg ha-1) was significantly higher than in 2014 (28.9 Mg ha-1). Crop nitrogen (N) needs, during the entire cycle of production, were satisfied according to the same pattern by SB, AC and AM, while green manuring and organic amendments in AM and AC determined a higher soil organic N content, compared with SB. As far as the production quality is concerned, both AM and AC treatments yielded strawberry fruits similar to SB, but with better characteristics in terms of color and phenolic content. AM and AC did not differentiate statistically in the two year period of our research. Copyright Â© Cambridge University Press 2016.

TI  - A portable in-situ near-infrared {LEDs}-based soil {Nitrogen} sensor using artificial {Neural} {Network
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring soil Nitrogen content for palm oil cultivation is paramount to produce high-quality palm oil. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a proposed portable near-infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LEDs)-based soil Nitrogen sensor in predicting the soil Nitrogen content using artificial neural network (ANN). First, soil samples that collected from a local oil palm plantation were scanned using the developed sensor and then followed by a conventional method, i.e. Kjeldahl analysis to measure the actual soil Nitrogen content. ANN was used for Chemometric analysis to develop a predictive model to in-situ predict the soil Nitrogen content using the near infrared light. The performance of ANN was validated using leave one out cross-validation. Results indicate that ANN with one hundred hidden neurons achieved the best accuracy with a root mean square error of cross-validation of 0.031\%. This finding suggests that the proposed portable sensor coupled with ANN is promising to satisfactorily predict soil Nitrogen content. Â© Penerbit UTHM.

TI  - Evaluation of soil moisture estimated from {IASI} measurements
VL  - 10783
SN  - NA
AB  - A simple yet effective scheme to estimate volumetric soil moisture (VSM) using infrared (IR) land surface emissivity retrieved from satellite IR spectral radiance measurements was recently developed, assuming other parameters impacting the radiative transfer (e.g., temperature, vegetation coverage, and surface roughness) are known for an acceptable time and space reference location. This scheme was applied to a decade of global IR emissivity data retrieved from MetOp-A Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer measurements. Global datasets of monthlymean 0.25Â° spatial-grid VSM, estimated from IR emissivity data (denoted as IR-VSM), are assembled to compare with those routinely provided by satellite microwave (MW) multi-sensor measurements (obtained from the ESA CCI website). The IR-VSM dataset is used to demonstrate its spatial variations as well as seasonal-cycles and inter-Annual variability which are spatially coherent and consistent with that from MW measurements. Herein we report on some initial evaluation of the IR-VSM absolute values using in-situ measurements available from the Soil Climate Analysis Network of the USDA website. From the 114 ground station locations, we infer a mean bias between monthly-mean in-situ VSM and satellite derived IR-VSM of 0.005 (m3 /m3) over the past decade, despite the differences between physical measurements. The absolute accuracy of IR-VSM is also evaluated using an independent source of soil moisture measurements. Â© SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval using {SMOS} brightness temperatures and a neural network trained on in situ measurements
VL  - 2017-July
SN  - NA
AB  - An algorithm using in situ measurements for training a neural network (NN) to retrieve soil moisture (SM) from SMOS observations is discussed. The in situ data are measurements of the SM content in the 0-5 cm depth layer from the SCAN, SNOâ„¡ and USCRN networks. It is shown that this approach can be used to retrieve SM at continental scale in North America. The NN retrieval (NNinSitu) is evaluated against in situ data not used during the training phase and against maps of the SMOS level 3 SM product and ECMWF SM models. NNinSitu SM values are closer to ECMWF values for wet areas. A method to use NNs as a tool to classify in situ sites representative of the remote sensing observations scale is briefly discussed.

VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Determining potassium supply of soil plays an important role in intensive crop production, since it is the basis for balancing nutrients and issuing fertilizer recommendations for achieving high and stable yields within economic feasibility. The aim of this study was to compare the different extraction methods of soil potassium from arable horizon of different types of soils with ammonium lactate method (KAL), which is frequently used as analytical method for determining the accessibility of nutrients and it is a common method used for issuing fertilizer recommendations in many Europe countries. In addition to the ammonium lactate method (KAL, pH 3.75), potassium was extracted with ammonium acetate (KAA, pH 7), ammonium acetate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (KAAEDTA, pH 4.6), Bray (KBRAY, pH 2.6) and with barium chloride (KBaCl2, pH 8.1). The analyzed soils were extremely heterogeneous with a wide range of determined values. Soil pH reaction (pHH2O) ranged from 4.77 to 8.75, organic matter content ranged from 1.87 to 4.94\% and clay content from 8.03 to 37.07\%. In relation to KAL method as the standard method, KBaCl2 method extracts 12.9\% more on average of soil potassium, while in relation to standard method, on average KAA extracts 5.3\%, KAAEDTA 10.3\%, and KBRAY 27.5\% less of potassium. Comparison of analyzed extraction methods of potassium from the soil is of high precision, and most reliable comparison was KAL method with KAAEDTA, followed by a: KAA, KBaCl2 and KBRAY method. Extremely significant statistical correlation between different extractive methods for determining potassium in the soil indicates that any of the methods can be used to accurately predict the concentration of potassium in the soil, and that carried out research can be used to create prediction model for concentration of potassium based on different methods of extraction.

TI  - UAS}-based {P}-band signals of opportunity for remote sensing of snow and root zone soil moisture
VL  - 10785
SN  - NA
AB  - We have developed the P-band Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) sensor based on the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to remotely sense Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) and Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM). The P-band UAS SoOp sensor for Hydrology (UASHydro) would operate on the S2 aircraft developed by Black Swift Technologies for sensing of SWE and RZSM with a spatial resolution of about 10m. Root-zone soil moisture and snow water storage in land are critical parameters of the water cycle. The long-term goal of our development would be to use small UAS to perform regional high resolution observation of two key hydrological measurements to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage for water management, crop production and forecasts of natural hazard. The UASHydro concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals at the 360-380 MHz band from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites launched by the US Navy. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE, while the soil moisture can be retrieved from the reflectivity at the P-band frequencies for MUOS. We have been conducting ground-based campaigns to test the instrumentation and data processing methods at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The field campaign data has provided support to the measurement concept. To install the SoOp technologies on the UAS, a lightweight antenna has been built and interfaces with the S2 built by Black Swift Technologies have been completed. A set of flights have been planned starting April 2018 through the end of 2018 in Colorado. Â© 2018 SPIE.

TI  - Genotypic differences in root system size in white mustard in relation to biomass yield and soil nitrogen content
VL  - 66
SN  - NA
AB  - Growing catch crops is one of the possible strategies to decrease erosion and nitrogen loss from soil profiles. Biomass yield and root system size have significant impacts on the soil nitrogen content. a three-year field experiment with eight varieties of white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) was established to evaluate the effects of genotype and environment on biomass yield, soil nitrogen content and rooting parameters. Significant effects of genotype were found for root length density (RLD), root surface density (RSD) and specific root length (SRL) in the plow layer (0 - 20 cm) and for root system size (RSS), measured by electrical capacitance method, during three phenological phases. Higher biomass yield in varieties with higher RLD and RSD values during ripening and a larger RSS during flowering were found in dry conditions. Relationship of the root system and biomass yield to nitrate and ammonia nitrogen content varied in different environments. We found a significant relation between the RSS and ammonia nitrogen content in more fertile environment on average over the three years. The nitrate nitrogen content was related to the RLD, RSD and SRL in favorable year at shallow soil depths (0 - 20 cm). Â© 2018 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno. All right reserved.

TI  - Soil fertility in response to urea and farmyard manure incorporation under different tillage systems in {Peshawar}, {Pakistan
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - The farmyard manure (FYM) combined with chemical fertilizers is considered to improve soil fertility and crop production. This was tested in a field experiment using three tillage practices (i.e., rotavator (MT), conventional tillage (CT) and deep tillage (DT) and six treatments of organic and inorganic fertilizers. The fertilizer treatments were i.e., control, 100\%, 75\%, 50\%, 25\%, 0\% N derived from urea, and the corresponding remaining N from FYM (i.e., 14.8 tons ha-1for 100\% FYM) to provide a pool of 120 kg N ha-1 as recommended for wheat crop. Averaged across fertilizer application, the soil organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorous, potash, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, mineralizable carbon and nitrogen were higher in MT than CT and DT at 0-30 cm soil depths and, both soil moisture and bulk density were higher in DT than other tillage practices at 20=-30 cm soil depths. Averaged across tillage practices, application of 100\% N derived from FYM to fulfill the crop N requirements resulted in a lower bulk density and higher organic matter, phosphorus, potash, microbial biomass nitrogen, mineralizable carbon and nitrogen at 0-30 cm depths when compared with other fertilizer ratios, while the contents of total nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon were higher in the plots receiving 75\% N from FYM and 25\% from synthetic fertilizer. Most of the soil properties were better in top soil 0-10 cm as compared to 10-20 or 20-30 cm soil depth. It was concluded from the experiment that soil properties at top surface soil 0-10 cm can be improved by MT as well as by application of 100\% N derived from FYM, which is an advisable practice for the local crop production in agro-climatic conditions of Peshawar, Pakistan.

TI  - Comparison of downscaling techniques for high resolution soil moisture mapping
VL  - 2017-July
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture impacts exchanges of water, energy and carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band can capture spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture in the landscape. Both ESA and NASA have launched L-band radiometers, in the form of the SMOS and SMAP satellites respectively, to monitor soil moisture globally, every 3-day at about 40 km resolution. However, their coarse scale restricts the range of applications. While SMAP included an L-band radar to downscale the radiometer soil moisture to 9 km, the radar failed after 3 months and this initial approach is not applicable to developing a consistent long term soil moisture product across the two missions anymore. Existing optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling methods could be an alternative to the radar-based approach for delivering such data. Nevertheless, retrieval of a consistent high resolution soil moisture product remains a challenge, and there has been no comprehensive intercomparison of the alternate approaches. This research undertakes an assessment of the different downscaling approaches using the SMAPEx-4 field campaign data. Â© 2017 IEEE.

VL  - 2018
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays important roles in surface energy conversion, crop growth, environmental protection, and drought monitoring. As crops grow, the associated vegetation seriously affects the ability of satellites to retrieve SM data. Here, we collected such data at different growth stages of maize using Bragg and X-Bragg scattering models based on the Freeman-Durden polarization decomposition method. We used the H/A/Alpha polarization decomposition approach to extract accurate threshold values of decomposed scattering components. The results showed that the H and Alpha values of bare soil areas were lower and those of vegetated areas were higher. The threshold values of the three scattering components were 0.2-0.4 H and 7-24Â° Alpha for the surface scattering component, 0.6-0.9 H and 22-50Â° Alpha for the volume scattering component, and other values for the dihedral scattering component. The SM data retrieved (using the X-Bragg model) on June 27, 2014, were better than those retrieved at other maize growth stages and were thus associated with the minimum root-mean-square error value (0.028). The satellite-evaluated SM contents were in broad agreement with data measured in situ. Our algorithm thus improves the accuracy of SM data retrieval from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.

VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing of soil water content (SWC) is a promising technology for hydrological applications to overcome large spatiotemporal variabilities of SWC. This study investigated the performance of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture product on METOP satellite (âˆ¼12.5 km and downscaled to âˆ¼1 km resolution), against ground measurements of SWC taken with a Hydrosense II probe along transects of 360â€“820 m on agricultural and natural land at locations in the Western Cape. The ASCAT products estimated fairly accurately seasonal trends of SWC; performance was better on lower slopes (R2 = 0.66) and uniform vegetation. ASCAT 12.5 km performed better in estimating SWC than the downscaled product (average concordance coefficient = 0.60 and 0.39, and R2 = 0.84 and 0.74, respectively). ASCAT 12.5 km was more responsive to rainfall events, whilst the downscaled product was more sensitive to vegetation characteristics (normalised difference vegetation index and land surface temperature). In situations with ground measurement networks and data availability constraints, remote sensing could be a feasible alternative to monitor SWC for hydrological applications at the meso-scale (regional scale).

TI  - Soil nitrogen dynamics under different quality and application methods of crop residues in maize croplands with contrasting soil textures in {Tanzania
VL  - 63
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in croplands need to be improved for the increase of food production in sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to investigate the crop residue management in terms of quality and application method to improve soil N dynamics during the period of crop growth in maize croplands with special reference to soil textures in dry tropical agroecosystems. Field experiments were conducted during the rainy seasons of 2012 and 2013 at clayey and sandy sites in Tanzania. Five treatment plots were established: plots with no residue applied (Ctrl plot), chemical fertilizer applied (F plot), maize residue (high C:N ratio = 60) incorporated (M-In plot) or mulched (M-On plot), and cowpea residue (low C:N ratio = 21) incorporated (P-In plot). In each plot, we regularly collected surface soil and crop samples and measured inorganic N (NO3 âˆ’â€“N and NH4 +â€“N), the soil respiration rate, and crop N uptake. Rainfall and soil moisture content were also continuously monitored. Our results showed that cowpea residue with high biodegradability caused prompt increases in the soil respiration rate and soil inorganic N because decomposition of the applied residue occurred within ca. 2 weeks after the application at both the clayey and sandy sites. It resulted in high N use efficiency in the early growing period and 18â€“73\% higher total crop N uptake than that in the maize residue plots at both sites. The application methods (incorporation and mulching) showed no significant difference in soil N dynamics and crop yield, although higher soil respiration was observed in the M-In plot than the M-On plot at the clayey site. However, at the sandy site, mulching of maize residue resulted in the increased soil inorganic N content in the M-On plot by 18â€“26\% compared with that in the M-In plot during the cropping season because of the higher soil moisture content. Consequently, crop N uptake in the mulching plot resulted in 26â€“59\% higher than that in the incorporation plot. Â© 2017 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.

TI  - Effects of different mechanized soil fertilization methods on corn soil fertility under continuous cropping
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - Experiments for mechanized soil fertilization for corns were conducted in Faku demonstration zone. On this basis, we studied effects on corn soil fertility under continuous cropping due to different mechanized soil fertilization methods. Our study would serve as a theoretical basis further for mechanized soil fertilization improvement and soil quality improvement in brown soil area. Based on the survey of soil physical characteristics during different corn growth periods, we collected soil samples from different corn growth periods to determine and make statistical analysis accordingly. Stalk returning to field with deep tillage proved to be the most effective on available nutrient improvement for arable soil in the demonstration zone. Different mechanized soil fertilization methods were remarkably effective on total phosphorus improvement for arable soil in the demonstration zone, while less effective on total nitrogen or total potassium, and not so effective on C/N ratio in soil. Stalk returning with deep tillage was more favorable to improve content of organic matter in soil, when compared with surface application, and organic granular fertilizer more favorable when compared with decomposed cow dung for such a purpose, too.

VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture measurement is essential to validate hydrological models and satellite data. In this work we provide an overview of different local and plot scale soil moisture measurement techniques applied in three different conditions in terms of altitude, land use, and soil type, namely a plain, a mountain meadow and a hilly vineyard. The main goal is to provide a synoptic view of techniques supported by practical case studies to show that in such different conditions it is possible to estimate a time and spatially resolved soil moisture by the same combination of instruments: contact-based methods (i.e., Time Domain Reflectometry-TDR, and two low frequency probes) for the time resolved, and hydro-geophysical minimally-invasive methods (i.e., Electromagnetic Induction-EMI, Ground Penetrating Radar-GPR, and the Electrical Resistivity Tomography-ERT) for the spatially resolved. Both long-term soil moisture measurements and spatially resolved measurement campaigns are discussed. Technical and operational measures are detailed to allow critical factors to be identified.

TI  - On-the-go soil nitrogen sensor based on near infrared spectroscopy
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Smart agriculture requires a reliable, real-time, and on-site characterization of soil properties. In the characterization of soil, nitrogen is the most important nutrient. Although many techniques have been developed for soil nitrogen estimation over the last few decades, on-site measurement in real-time still poses problems. Spectroscopic techniques are among the ones most utilized for this purpose and near infrared spectroscopy is the most convenient method so far. In this work, a discrete wavelength near infrared spectroscopic device is developed and tested. Calibration is done using partial least squares regression method. The on-field testing versus laboratory testing shows a high value of coefficient of determination. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Performance evaluation of the triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models based on {Landsat}-5 {TM} data and in situ measurements
VL  - 55
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an important parameter at the land-atmosphere interface. In past decades, passive microwave remote sensing offers a good opportunity for obtaining SSM on a global scale, and many downscaling methods have been proposed using the triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution of its SSM products for regional applications. This paper aimed to examine and compare the effectiveness of five typical triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models for estimating SSM with Landsat-5 data and in situ measurements from the Maqu network on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau for nine cloud-free days. The results showed that the model that treats the SSM as a second-order polynomial with land surface temperature, vegetation indices (VIs), and surface albedo as inputs exhibited the best performance compared with the results of other models. The VI comparison indicated that the use of the normalized difference VI or the fractional vegetation cover in this model outperformed other VIs, with the root-mean-square deviation of approximately 0.055 m3/m3 and the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.78 at the nine-day average level. In addition, a significant spatial scale effect of the model was also found through analyzing the model fitting results at different window sizes. The study provides important insight into the best empirical relationship models for capturing soil moisture dynamics. These models can support the passive microwave soil moisture data spatial downscaling and validation applications in future studies. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - A comparative study of polymer coated capacitive sensors for soil moisture sensing
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper, a comparative performance analysis based on two different types of polymer, namely PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) and DQN-60 coated capacitive sensor is reported to find out a low-cost sensor for soil moisture measurement. PMMA is readily available and inexpensive polymer which is coated on copper electrodes separated by epoxy to make the sensor. Statistical study shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) and percent normalized RMSE (\%NRMSE) for polynomial fit of PMMA coated sensor is quite high. Size optimization of the PMMA coated sensor is studied here for better performance and improved RMSE. A simple signal conditioning circuit is proposed at this point to measure the capacitance change and produce the output in terms of voltage. The voltage to soil moisture calibration is done using thermo-gravimetric method. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Recent results on soil moisture remote sensing using {P}-band signals of opportunity
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an essential variable in meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. Current methods in passive and active microwave remote sensing at L-band (e.g. SMOS or SMAP) are limited to a sensing depth of less than 10 cm. Observing RZSM (water in the top meter of soil) will require lower frequencies (P-band), presenting significant difficulties for a spaceborne instrument, due to the required antenna size, the presence of radio-frequency interference (RFI), and competition for spectrum allocations (in the case of active radar). Bistatic radar using Signal of Opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital satellite transmitters) offers the possibility of remote sensing using powerful signals already occupying bands allocated for communications. This paper will present early results from the first airborne campaign to study P-band reflectometry for soil moisture, conducted in Oklahoma between October 17-26, 2016. A geosynchronous communication satellite, transmitting a 25 KHz data signal on a 260.375 MHz carrier was uses at the signal source. Preliminary assessment of the data showed high reflectivity over a lake and consistent results between subsequent overflights of the watershed. Recently, a tower experiment has started using a 20 MHz wide signal centered at 370 MHz. Linearly polarized measurements were made over bare soil between 25-May-2017 and 8-June-2017 observing a strong reflected signal. Corn is being planted on the field and measurements will be made throughout the growing season. Â© 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Soil fertility is an important factor to measure the quality of the soil as it indicates the extent to which it can support plant life. The fertility of soil is measured by the amount of macro and micronutrients, water, pH etc. Soil nutrients are depleted after every harvest and hence must be replenished. To maintain nutrient levels in the soil in case of deficiency, fertilizers are added to soil. Most of the farmers choose to approximate the amount of fertilizers and add them manually. However, addition of fertilizers in right amount is a matter of great importance as excess or insufficient addition can harm the plant life and reduce the yield. Use of modern trends and technology promises to provide a solution to the above problem. Though automated techniques for seeding, weeding, harvesting the crops etc. have been proposed and implemented, none of the techniques target at maintaining soil fertility. The proposed research aims at restoring the levels of Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium in the soil by the measuring the amount of nutrients present. The presence of nutrients is determined by chemical processes and quantified using sensors. An automated system has been developed for the controlled addition of fertilizers in order to avoid excess/ deficient fertilizers in the soil. Â© 2016 IEEE.

Our study shows that ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) microsensors are suitable for quick on-site or long-term analysis of nutrients measured directly in soil as opposed to soil extracts analysis. Our pH-ISFET recorded soil pH for six months with results in good accordance with standard sampling method and without any loss of sensitivity. The adaptation of pH-ISFET in pNO3 and pNH4-ISFET allowed, for the first time, the in-situ measurements of natural variations of soil nitrogen contents caused by microorganisms' activity.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment 2014 [1] was a ground-validation field campaign conducted in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM) and adjacent Piedmont region May-June of 2014 in support of the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM). The Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP) instrument installed on NASA's King Air aircraft was flown over the eastern foothills of the SAM, complex terrain and heterogeneous land cover including forested areas, agricultural fields, and lakes, during IPHEx. [SLAP is an aircraft scale simulator of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite mission.] A polarization mixing approach to wrap the georeferenced two-dimensional H-Pol and V -Pol SLAP brightness temperatures (TBs) on three-dimensional topography, hereafter referred to as topographic correction, was implemented. The algorithm requires the dynamic determination of global and local frames of reference for each EFOV (Extended Field of View) along the flight line, followed by the determination of correction factors calculated as the ratios of local and aircraft based antenna electric fields. The corrected TB measurements were subsequently used to estimate soil moisture with evaluation conducted against ground-based gravimetric soil moisture samples collected at various sites concurrently with the flight. The spatial organization of corrected TBs was assessed using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). The corrected TBs exhibit robust scaling behavior with TWI that is significantly different from that of the georeferenced SLAP observations without topographic correction. This finding suggests that TWI distributions can be used to downscaling SMAP products toward capturing the spatial organization of soil moisture conditioned by landform alone or in combination with methods that use land attributes such soil texture and vegetation [3].

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper, the results of radiothermal remote sensing of moisture and temperature of thawed soil on a test site in the Taymyr Peninsula using full-polarimetric observations of brightness temperature at the frequency of 10.7GHz are presented. The brightness temperature data were obtained from MTVZA-GYa radiometer on a board of Meteor-M No. 2 satellite with footprint area near the Norilsk city and Khatanga, the Russia Federation. The MTVZA-GYa data covered the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The method to retrieve the soil moisture and temperature was based on solving an inverse problem by minimizing the norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the brightness temperature. The calculation of the brightness temperature was performed using a semi-empirical model of radiothermal emission the parameters of which have been pre-calibrated at the test sites in the area of Norilsk and Khatanga, as well as using a soil dielectric model with high in organic matter. The dielectric model was especially designed based on laboratory measurements of the complex permittivity of the organic-rich soil samples, which were collected at the test site near Norilsk city. As a result, the values of the root-mean-square error between the retrieved and measured soil temperatures and soil moisture were not exceed 6.5? 0.06cm3/cm3, respectively for both test sites. These results indicate the perspectives of using the full-polarimetric observations of MTVZA-GYa radiometer on a board of Meteor-M No. 2 satellite in the X-band for the purpose of measuring the soil temperature and soil moisture in the Arctic region.

VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the capability of a combined fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for soil fertility evaluation of common bean in Shiraz, Iran. A set of membership functions was constructed to represent the soil fertility classes, which were derived from 50 field samples collected through a purposive sampling approach. Seven soil parameters including phosphorus (P), potassium (K), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) copper (Cu) and organic content (OC), of the soil were chosen for soil fertility analysis using inverse distance weighting (IDW) method and then fuzzy and AHP method were employed. The IDW showed that the south of the study area had the more P amount compared to the other area (Fig. a). In contrast, the Fe value was between 1.40 to 14.98 (mg/kg) where only some parts of northwest and southwest had the medium Fe value (about 8 mg/kg). The OC value of the study area was between 0.18 to 1.64\% which all of the study area with OC more than 1\% was suitable for bean production except the some parts of north and south. Fuzzy map showed that except the parts of northwest, all of the area was suitable for K that had the value close to 1. AHP model showed that the most important factor in soil fertility were P and OC of the soil with weights of 0.39 and 0.37, respectively. Fuzzy-AHP model showed that 52.38\% of the study area had medium fertility for bean production and this method was a useful tool for prediction of soil fertility status in each case study.

VL  - 28
SN  - NA
AB  - Participatory development of sustainable soil fertility (SF) management practices requires building bridges between science and indigenous knowledge. Whereas scientific SF indicators are reasonably standardized, indigenous SF indicators are site-specific and system-specific. Furthermore, the process of indigenous SF evaluation is very time consuming. This study therefore aimed at investigating the compatibility between local and analytical SF indicators, and at optimizing the process of indigenous SF assessment. Thirteen cotton plots were evaluated by famers on a scale from 0 (fertile) to 5 (degraded) and sampled for physico-chemical characterization. Farmers identified 13 SF indicators related to soil, crop status, biological activity and management. Of these, 10 were retained to calculate a local SF index (LFI). Clay and silt content, pHwater and P-Bray explained 88\% of the total variance in LFI, indicating good yet incomplete compatibility between the indigenous and scientific approaches. Because of redundancy among local indicators, it was shown that the LFI could be estimated using one pedo-indicator, one bio-indicator and one phyto-indicator without significant loss of accuracy. However, a minimum local indicator dataset composed of six indicators was recommended to allow for data cross-checking. There was a trade-off between the number of indicators and the number of farmers needed to estimate the LFI. There was a reasonable agreement between local and analytical fertility indicators, even though farmers' perception appeared rather more based on the effect and consequences of SF than on its actual status. Although compatible, analytical indicators should be translated into variables similar to local indicators in order to facilitate communication. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Detection of soil nitrogen using near infrared sensors based on soil pretreatment and algorithms
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nitrogen content is one of the important growth nutrient parameters of crops. It is a prerequisite for scientific fertilization to accurately grasp soil nutrient information in precision agriculture. The information about nutrients such as nitrogen in the soil can be obtained quickly by using a near-infrared sensor. The data can be analyzed in the detection process, which is nondestructive and non-polluting. In order to investigate the effect of soil pretreatment on nitrogen content by near infrared sensor, 16 nitrogen concentrations were mixed with soil and the soil samples were divided into three groups with different pretreatment. The first group of soil samples with strict pretreatment were dried, ground, sieved and pressed. The second group of soil samples were dried and ground. The third group of soil samples were simply dried. Three linear different modeling methods are used to analyze the spectrum, including partial least squares (PLS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted algorithm (CARS). The model of nonlinear partial least squares which supports vector machine (LS-SVM) is also used to analyze the soil reflectance spectrum. The results show that the soil samples with strict pretreatment have the best accuracy in predicting nitrogen content by near-infrared sensor, and the pretreatment method is suitable for practical application.

VL  - 204
SN  - NA
AB  - Maize-based intercropping, especially with legumes, can result in increased yields of the whole cropping system and lead to efficient utilization of soil phosphorus (P). Field experiments were conducted for two consecutive years to investigate the mechanisms behind the increased yields of maize by increasing soil P availability in intercropping systems and how P application and companion crops influenced the process. The planting patterns and P fertilizer application rates significantly affected P taken up by maize. The increased yields of maize âˆ’ average increases of 22.67 and 12.60\% for maize (Zea mays)/soybean (Glycine max) and maize/sweet potato (Dioscorea esculenta)intercropping, respectively; and 12.60 and 7.17\% for maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato after P fertilization, respectively âˆ’ indicated that the interspecific stimulation of P uptake may be a general phenomenon controlled by soil P availability and crop species. Under the maize/soybean intercropping system, considerable facilitation was observed when roots were not kept separate; suggesting that selective enrichment of competent species may be responsible for increased P uptake during intercropping. Positive interactions were supported by soil P activation processes that increased P availability, such as pH changes and acid phosphatase activity. In the intercropping of maize/soybean, acid phosphatase activity was significantly higher than that of maize/sweet potato. In accordance, soil acidification increased with root interaction. Soil acidification increased in maize/soybean intercropping with root contact as did acid phosphatase activity especially in P-deficient soil, which enhanced soil P availability. It was concluded that there was indeed P activation when maize grew with root interactions in the maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato systems. However, the facilitation was stronger in P-deficient soil. Interspecific interactions and P application together contributed to the yield advantage of intercropping. Â© 2016

TI  - Evaluation of {SWAT} simulated soil moisture at catchment scale by field measurements and {Landsat} derived indices
VL  - 193
SN  - NA
AB  - The quantification of soil moisture under different soils and crops at regional scale is a challenging task. Hence, such studies are limited by the availability of ground based measurements. The current study evaluates the spatial and temporal patterns of daily soil moisture simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the upper 30 cm of the soil profile with indirect soil moisture estimates from Landsat for 2016. The Thermal Vegetation Difference Index (TVDI), was calculated based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the brightness temperature (BT) using Landsat images, from which regression models were trained by using field measurements from Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to calculate soil moisture. Two agricultural catchments namely, Gerdau and Wipperau in Germany were satisfactorily calibrated using SWAT for daily streamflow (1975â€“2000) with NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiency) {\textgreater}0.55 and PBIAS (Percent bias) {\textless}5.5\%. The parameter uncertainty assessment during the irrigation season (Marâ€“Sept, 2016) for soil moisture revealed that the uncertainty band is narrow (p-factor = 0.57â€“0.83; r-factor = 0.52 âˆ’ 1.3). Spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture from Landsat and SWAT were evaluated by using boxplots and absolute soil moisture difference maps. Results revealed that the overall spatial and temporal patterns of boxplots matched better for the dry period (correlation, r â‰¥ 0.90) compared to the wet period (r â‰¥ 0.57). The mean absolute difference between soil moisture from Landsat and SWAT ranged between 0.9â€“10\% for most soils. In addition to it, the soil map was refined to match soil moisture patterns shown in Landsat images for one sandy soil, which further improved the mean absolute difference (1.06â€“6\%). The current study provides an approach to use remotely sensed soil moisture for verifying hydrological modeling results and for optimizing the parameterization of soils, which may bridge the gap between global, regional and field studies in agricultural water management.

TI  - Comparison of multiple statistical techniques to predict soil phosphorus
VL  - 114
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil scientists have tested various models to predict soil physical, chemical and biological properties over the last few decades. Determination of soil phosphorus (P) in soils is difficult due to the sensitivity of its measurement, especially in developing nations because of lack of sufficient facilities and limitation of financial resources. In this study, advanced statistical methods (intelligent and regression models) were evaluated, such as genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy inference system (FIS), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), partial least squares (PLS), principal components regression (PCR), ordinary least squares (OLS) and multiple regression (MR), to determine the best model to predict P. This research was carried out at Mazandaran Research Center of Agricultural and Natural Resources, Sari, Iran. Four properties of soils, clay, sand, soil organic matter (SOM) and pH were presented to the models as independent parameters to predict soil P. Such advanced quantitative models have never been compared with each other in order to find the best model for prediction. The results revealed that PLS (among regression models) and GA and ANN (among intelligent models) are promising approaches for the estimation of soil P with higher R2 and value account for (VAF) and lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the other models. The ANN model predicted soil P more accurately than the other models with R2 = 0.912 and RMSE = 4.019. The GA and PLS models both provided formulas to predict soil P with good fits. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that SOM was a more effective factor predicting soil P relative to the other variables and SOM provides an important source of P in soil.

TI  - Retrieving landscape freeze/thaw state from {Soil} {Moisture} {Active} {Passive} ({SMAP}) radar and radiometer measurements
VL  - 194
SN  - NA
AB  - Over one-third of the global land area undergoes a seasonal transition between predominantly frozen and non-frozen conditions each year, with the land surface freeze/thaw (FT) state a significant control on hydrological and biospheric processes over northern land areas and at high elevations. The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission produced a daily landscape FT product at 3-km spatial resolution derived from ascending and descending orbits of SMAP high-resolution L-band (1.4 GHz) radar measurements. Following the failure of the SMAP radar in July 2015, coarser (36-km) footprint SMAP radiometer inputs were used to develop an alternative daily passive microwave freeze/thaw product. In this study, in situ observations are used to examine differences in the sensitivity of the 3-km radar versus the 36-km radiometer measurements to the landscape freeze/thaw state during the period of overlapping instrument operation. Assessment of the retrievals at high-latitude SMAP core validation sites showed excellent agreement with in situ flags, exceeding the 80\% SMAP mission accuracy requirement. Similar performance was found for the radar and radiometer products using both air temperature and soil temperature derived FT reference flags. There was a tendency for SMAP thaw retrievals to lead the surface flags due to the influence of wet snow cover conditions on both the radar and radiometer signal. Comparison with other satellite derived FT products showed those derived from passive measurements (SMAP radiometer; Aquarius radiometer; Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - 2) retrieved less frozen area than the active products (SMAP radar; Aquarius radar).

TI  - Applicability research of optical remote sensing derived indices in soil moisture downscaling based on {SiB2} simulation
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - There are many indices, e.g. SEE (Soil Evaporation Efficiency), TVDI (Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index) and ATI (Apparent Thermal Inertia), usually used in downscaling of coarse-resolution soil moisture derived from microwave remote sensing platforms including AMSR-E, FY-3B, SMOS and SMAP so on. However, which index is optimal and what is its applicative conditions still keep unknown. This paper attempts to use SiB2 (Simple Biosphere Model 2) to simulate the soil surface temperature, canopy temperature, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, and explore the relationships between various indices and soil moisture to determine their relevance and the applicability. Simulation shows that apparent thermal inertia is not applicable under the condition of higher vegetation coverage (e.g. FVC {\textgreater} 0.65), while the soil evaporation efficiency has a higher correlation with soil moisture under dense vegetation coverage and is recommend to be used for downscaling of soil moisture.

AB  - Global soil moisture is one of the critical land surface initial conditions for numerical weather, climate, and hydrological predictions. Since it is not practical to provide global maps using ground measurements, land surface soil moisture remote sensing has been a hot research topic in the last several decades. As a result, a number of soil moisture products have been produced from different satellite sensors with different spatial and temporal coverage and quality. To make effective use of all available soil moisture products, a Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) has been developed at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to produce a one-stop shop for all operational soil moisture products from different satellite sensors. To increase the spatial and temporal coverage of soil moisture product, SMOPS also provides a data layer that merges soil moisture retrievals from multiple satellites in addition to the individual soil moisture retrievals from each of the available satellites. This paper gives an overall introduction of SMOPS and its validations using ground measurements.

SN  - NA
AB  - Efficient surface soil moisture mapping is essential in precision agriculture application. Achieving efficient soil moisture monitoring is indispensable and meaningful. Cloud computing technology can enhance computational efficiency enormously. The geospatial web service was developed to assist agronomic decision making, and this tool can be scaled to any location and crop. By integrating cloud computing and web service enabled information infrastructure, this study proposes cloud computing-enabled spatio-temporal cyber-physical monitoring to provide an efficient solution for soil moisture monitoring in PA in remote sensing view. In the architecture, diverse Open Geospatial Consortium web services work closely with each other. In experiment, Hubei Province, located on the Jianghan Plain in central China, is selected as the remote sensing study area. GF-1 1A wide field view data is chosen as the data source. With comparison with other methods, the performance of soil moisture mapping is promoted. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Comparative study of soil moisture estimations from {SMOS} satellite mission, {GLDAS} database, and cosmic-ray neutrons measurements at {COSMOS} station in {Eastern} {Poland
VL  - 283
SN  - NA
AB  - The paper presents a detailed comparative study of three surface soil moisture datasets retrieved from Cosmic-Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) in situ neutron measurement, CATDS Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite microwave observations, and modelled data of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Subsurface datasets were also calculated from the in situ and satellite measurements by using an exponential filter and were compared with the GLDAS estimates. For these comparisons, the Triple Collocation (TC) method, Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients, trend charts, and scatterplots were used. The main goal of this work was to verify the concordance of cosmic-ray neutron measurements with low-resolution soil moisture data from the CATDS SMOS and GLDAS products. The second objective was to determine the possibility of obtaining comparable subsurface soil moisture products from the aforementioned soil moisture data source. The obtained results show that data from the COSMOS sensor, which assesses soil moisture in an area 600 m in diameter, agree reasonably well with the CATDS SMOS and GLDAS data having spatial resolution of about 25 km. These conclusions suggest that COSMOS Derlo measurements can be particularly useful for validation of low-resolution satellite soil moisture observations as well as modelled values. The results obtained by using the TC method also revealed satisfactory agreement among all studied surface soil moisture data. However, the performed analysis shows some preponderance of SMOS and COSMOS data over GLDAS products. Although GLDAS data show a noticeable smoothing effect, COSMOS and CATDS SMOS more effectively reveal temporal soil moisture changes. Thus, for some applications, the use of CATDS SMOS estimates rather than GLDAS products may be more appropriate. Results retrieved by using an exponential filter are significant and encouraging. In particular, subsurface soil moisture values calculated from CATDS SMOS show stronger correlation with COSMOS Derlo data than those of GLDAS. Furthermore, COSMOS Derlo data also respond more intensively to surface soil moisture changes. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rainfall estimation by inverting {SMOS} soil moisture estimates: {A} comparison of different methods over {Australia
VL  - 121
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture has reached a level of maturity and accuracy for which the retrieved products can be used to improve hydrological and meteorological applications. In this study, the soil moisture product from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is used for improving satellite rainfall estimates obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission multisatellite precipitation analysis product (TMPA) using three different â€œbottom upâ€ techniques: SM2RAIN, Soil Moisture Analysis Rainfall Tool, and Antecedent Precipitation Index Modification. The implementation of these techniques aims at improving the well-known â€œtop downâ€ rainfall estimate derived from TMPA products (version 7) available in near real time. Ground observations provided by the Australian Water Availability Project are considered as a separate validation data set. The three algorithms are calibrated against the gauge-corrected TMPA reanalysis product, 3B42, and used for adjusting the TMPA real-time product, 3B42RT, using SMOS soil moisture data. The study area covers the entire Australian continent, and the analysis period ranges from January 2010 to November 2013. Results show that all the SMOS-based rainfall products improve the performance of 3B42RT, even at daily time scale (differently from previous investigations). The major improvements are obtained in terms of estimation of accumulated rainfall with a reduction of the root-mean-square error of more than 25\%. Also, in terms of temporal dynamic (correlation) and rainfall detection (categorical scores) the SMOS-based products provide slightly better results with respect to 3B42RT, even though the relative performance between the methods is not always the same. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and the spatial variability of their performances are identified in order to indicate the ways forward for this promising research activity. Results show that the integration of bottom up and top down approaches has the potential to improve the quality of near-real-time rainfall estimates from remote sensing in the near future. Â© 2016.

VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - Two perennial forage systems were evaluated in a 3-yr study for their effect on forage biomass and nutritive value, botanical composition, soil nutrients, forage disappearance, beef cow performance, and economic analysis. Spring-calving, dry, pregnant Bos taurus beef cows [yr 1 (n = 60), 632 Â± 8 kg; yr 2 (n = 60), 638 Â± 5 kg; yr 3 (n = 48), 653 Â± 5 kg] were managed in 1 of 2 replicated (n = 3) forage systems: (1) grazing stockpiled perennial forage [TDN = 52.5, CP = 10.7 (\%DM); SPF] in field paddocks or (2) drylot pen feeding round bale hay [TDN = 52.7, CP = 10.0 (\%DM); HY]. Forage utilization was greater (P = 0.01) for HY cows in all years (94\%) compared with yr-1 and yr-2 SPF cows (58 and 78\%, respectively). Forage disappearance was greater (P = 0.01) for yr-3 SPF cows than HY system cows; however, supplement was greater (P = 0.01) for SPF cows compared with HY cows during the study period. Soil NO3-N (P = 0.02) and organic carbon (P = 0.01) amounts at the 0- to 30-cm soil depth were greater in SPF paddocks than HY paddocks. Body weight and BCS did not differ (P {\textgreater} 0.05) for cows in either SPF or HY systems. Averaged over 3-yr, SPF total system costs were 14\% less (P = 0.01) compared with the HY system. Results suggest field grazing stockpiled perennial forages in western Canada can be a viable strategy without any negative effect to beef cow performance.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - With the rapid development of China's economy, there is a rapid increase in demand for mineral resources, and a growing strength of mineral resources development, it will inevitably lead to many environmental problems such as geological environmental disasters, air pollution, etc. Mining environmental issues increasingly become the focus of attention. Soil moisture is one of the key indicators to monitor soil quality of mining area. It is a sensitive indicator of the health factors of the ecological environment and particularly of great importance in land reclamation of mining area. With the development of remote sensing technology, RS has been widely used in mine monitoring. RS can be used effectively in real-time, dynamic, large-scale soil moisture monitoring, it's of great significance to environmental protection and remediation. In this paper, four scenes of Landsat remote sensing images have been selected to make remote sensing quantitative analysis of soil moisture in Nanfen, Benxi City, Liaoning Province, an open-air iron mine Nanfen Opencast. Four images' time series were May 18, 2002, May 29, 2006, June 25, 2010, June 4, 2014. The soil moisture temporal and spatial variation features of Nanfen Opencast have been reflected by The SMMI (soil moisture monitoring index) index basing on SWIR-Nir feature space from 2002 to 2014. The NDVI index has been used to verify the soil moisture result. The result provided a basis for the study of environment monitoring in Nanfen Opencast, and provided a scientific basis for decision making of economic development and environmental protection in this region.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Non-destructive soil water content determination is a fundamental component for many agricultural and environmental applications. The accuracy and costs of the sensors define the measurement scheme and the ability to fit the natural heterogeneous conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate five commercially available and relatively cheap sensors usually grouped with impedance and FDR sensors. ThetaProbe ML2x (impedance) and ECH2O EC-10, ECH2O EC-20, ECH2O EC-5, and ECH2O TE (all FDR) were tested on silica sand and loess of defined characteristics under controlled laboratory conditions. The calibrations were carried out in nine consecutive soil water contents from dry to saturated conditions (pure water and saline water). The gravimetric method was used as a reference method for the statistical evaluation (ANOVA with significance level 0.05). Generally, the results showed that our own calibrations led to more accurate soil moisture estimates. Variance component analysis arranged the factors contributing to the total variation as follows: calibration (contributed 42\%), sensor type (contributed 29\%), material (contributed 18\%), and dry bulk density (contributed 11\%). All the tested sensors performed very well within the whole range of water content, especially the sensors ECH2O EC-5 and ECH2O TE, which also performed surprisingly well in saline conditions.

AB  - The accurate estimation of available soil phosphorus (ASP) is required for the effective management of environmental resources and improving agricultural productivity. Direct measurement of ASP at large scales is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, many empirical models or pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to obtain ASP. This study introduces a new model that estimates ASP from easily measurable soil properties by using the multi-objective group method of data handling (mGMDH) approach. Organic carbon, clay content, calcium carbonate equivalent, pH and ASP were obtained from 100 soil samples, which were collected by the stratified random sampling strategy in Mashhad Plain, Khorasan-e-Razavi Province, Northeast Iran. The suggested model for the prediction of ASP generated satisfactory results in terms of the statistical performance criteria. The coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE) values of the mGMDH model in training step were 0.606 and 4.9671 mg kgâˆ’1, respectively, whereas those were 0.504 and 5.6685 mg kgâˆ’1, in the testing step. It was concluded that only 50 \% of variations of ASP could be described by selecting easy-to-measure soil variables and owing to the key role of phosphorus in soil fertility and precision agriculture, the other related factors such as terrain attributes and fertilizer management should also be considered as they influence the distribution of the soil phosphorus.

TI  - An interoperable wireless sensor network platform for spatio-temporal soil moisture and soil temperature estimation
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatio-temporal root zone soil moisture (STRZSM) plays a vital role in the understanding of land-surface dynamics, climate change, soil-water-balance, hydrologic processes, vegetation growth and yield modeling. STRZSM trails can be captured using remote sensing, in-situ or ground based measurements or through land surface models. Apart from this, new generation of low-cost soil moisture sensors present cost effective way of in-situ measurement of soil moisture, but suffer from inherent heterogeneity between sensing techniques, protocol variations and non-standard calibration methods. Thus, long term monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture trails requires interoperability between sensing platforms, process-based and statistical modeling and inclusion of remote sensing techniques. In this study, an attempt has been made to design and deploy an interoperable sensing platform that complies with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. Proposed system uses sensors to estimate point-based soil moisture and temperature observation at different depths of 15, 30, 45 and 60cm each. Pilot feasibility study was carried out for the duration of three months from Jan-Mar 2016 in the study area. The results include visualizations for soil moisture and soil temperature profiles at different depths over the period of three months. This study also explores the possibility of deploying dense interoperable sensor networks to capture spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture over heterogeneous landscapes. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Effective calibration of low-cost soil water content sensors
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content is a key variable for understanding and modelling ecohydrological processes. Low-cost electromagnetic sensors are increasingly being used to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil water content, despite the reduced accuracy of such sensors as compared to reference electromagnetic soil water content sensing methods such as time domain reflectometry. Here, we present an effective calibration method to improve the measurement accuracy of low-cost soil water content sensors taking the recently developed SMT100 sensor (Truebner GmbH, Neustadt, Germany) as an example. We calibrated the sensor output of more than 700 SMT100 sensors to permittivity using a standard procedure based on five reference media with a known apparent dielectric permittivity (1 {\textless} Ka {\textless} 34.8). Our results showed that a sensor-specific calibration improved the accuracy of the calibration compared to single â€œuniversalâ€ calibration. The associated additional effort in calibrating each sensor individually is relaxed by a dedicated calibration setup that enables the calibration of large numbers of sensors in limited time while minimizing errors in the calibration process.

TI  - Determinants of integrated soil fertility management technologies adoption by smallholder farmers in the {Chinyanja} {Triangle} of {Southern} {Africa
VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) technologies have proven to be viable options for improving land productivity and increasing yield. However, adoption of the set of complementary technologies that are required in ISFM is quite variable and studies tend to focus on single technologies. In this study we used cluster analysis to group technologies and ordered probit to determine the probability of multiple technology adoption. The result show that usage of ISFM in the Chinyanja Triangle (Southern Africa) is grouped into 3 technological sets based on complementarities. The set of nutrient dense technologies of inorganic fertiliser, compost and animal manure (ISFMset3) indicates that they are used by farmers who face similar opportunities of having land that require minimal input, sell produce at farm gate as opposed to market, have more transport and communication facilities, and recover from livestock loss. Loss of crops, however, deter adoption of this set. The technological set comprising of fallow, rotation and grain legumes (ISFMset2) which enhances biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation with complementary effects in cereal dominated farming system, is more likely adopted by households with land that require more inputs, are more educated, own more bicycles and have higher financial capital. Other four technologies (ISFMset1 including mulch, lime, compost and agroforestry) are used by a few individuals to address specific constraints in nutrient and water retention, and acidity. The result also indicated variations in usage of ISFMset3 between sites. These results are instrumental in identifying factors that influence adoption of a set of ISFM technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle and could be of use in targeting research and development initiatives.

TI  - A quick dielectric method to determine insitu soil water content for precision water use under sustainable agricultural practices
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Precise water use systems under sustainable agriculture may only be achieved if in-situ soil water content and availability of the plant can be measured quickly. Soil water content can be determined directly using the gravimetrical method by calculating the loss of water when the soil dries out, and indirectly by measuring other variables from which soil water can be calculated. The indirect methods have some advantages when compared to the direct gravimetrical method because measured; non-destructive soil water data are available instantly. Soil dielectric properties have strong relationships with soil water content and have been used widely as indirect methods of soil water determination, but the cost of the available instrument is too expensive for small-scale farmers. Two studies were conducted in 2011 and 2015 to develop a quick, cheap method to determine in-situ soil water content and precise water use by crops. The method applied a non-linear relation between soil water content (Î¸, in gg-1) and soil electrical impedance (Z, in kÏ‰) as follows: Î¸ = a. Zb where a and b are constants. Parameter Z showed a good predictor for soil water content (R â‰¥ 0.90) therefore can be used to determine soil water content in the field quickly. The dielectric method has been successfully used to determine the water balance in the vegetated soils, in wich changes in soil water content caused by daily rainfall as low as 10 mm was detected up to the depth of 60 cm. The method was also successfully capable of calculating the amount of water used by palm oil nursery grown in media with different levels of soil organic matter.

TI  - Study of soil moisture remote sensing retrieval system based on {Interactive} {Data} {Language
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - It has long been recognized that soil moisture is a significant parameter of climatological, hydrological and ecological systems. In energy exchange and matter exchange between land surface and atmosphere, soil moisture is also a key state variable. It is very important to monitor soil moisture in large range for hydrological and meteorological process and laws research, as well as for agriculture production. The monitoring methods of soil moisture include site observation on the ground and monitoring by remote sensing. The application of site observation is suitable for small range monitoring because it is labor-intensive and equipment-intensive. While, remote sensing has the positive aspects in monitoring surface soil moisture(within several centimeters) status in large range. However, the popular soil moisture data products from remote sensing are so rough in spatial resolution that it is more suitable for global scale rather than regional scale. Being affected by complicated factors, such as meteorology, topography, soil properties and vegetation, soil moisture is a highly variable parameter both temporally and spatially. From the view of regional scale research, it would lead much non-determinacy to relevant research, no matter using soil moisture data from ground-based observation constrained in small range or using those already existing data products from satellite observation rough in spatial resolution. For improving research reliability of regional scale, it demands observation data not only with high spatial resolution but also in large scale. Aiming at this issue, this paper adopting MODIS(moderate-resolution imaging spectrometer) data with middle resolution(1km) as data source, employing thermal inertia model as retrieval model, using Interactive Data Language(IDL) as platform, develops a system of soil moisture retrieval for regional scale research. This system provides functions including fast data preprocessing for massive remote sensing data, processing for measured data, soil moisture data retrieval as well as the rapid output of retrieval result. It would support the soil moisture fast retrieval in regional scale, make up the defects of rough resolution of existing soil moisture data production, realize the fast automatic processing for massive remote sensing data.

TI  - Temperature and probe-to-probe variability effects on the performance of capacitance soil moisture sensors in an oxisol
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Reliable and accurate monitoring of soil water content (Î¸) across the landscape is indispensable for many water resources applications. Capacitance-based in situ soil water content measuring devices are extensively used despite their sensitivity to soil properties besides water content, e.g., temperature and organic matter content. The main goals of this study were to: (i) examine the effects of temperature, hysteresis of the temperature response, and probe-to-probe variability on the performance of three (5TE, EC-5, and EC-TM) single capacitance sensors (SCS) in a Hawaiian Oxisol; and (ii) develop empirical calibration equations to correct for temperature and improve measurement accuracy. The SCS raw output and thermocouple temperature measurements were recorded at 1-min intervals during heating and cooling cycles between 1 and 45Â°C. The three SCS and thermocouples were inserted in uniformly packed soils with Î¸ varying from 0 to 0.55 m3 mâˆ’3. We used three probes for each SCS, and the entire experiment was replicated with two heating and cooling cycles. Temperature, hysteresis, and the probe-to-probe variability effects were highly significant (p {\textless} 0.05) for all three SCS. Estimated Î¸ using soil-specific calibrations at 25Â°C significantly increased with increasing temperature for all SCS. The 5TE sensor showed increasing temperature sensitivity with increasing water content. However, the EC-5 and EC-TM sensors exhibited a bidirectional response to temperature, with the highest sensitivity at 0.10 m3 mâˆ’3 water content. An empirically derived temperature-dependent calibration equation substantially reduced the variability ({\textgreater}90\% reduction in interquartile range) in measured water content due to changing soil temperature. Applying differing temperature corrections for heating and cooling did not improve the calibration any further. Â© Soil Science Society of America 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

TI  - Assessing the effect of scaling methods on retrieval of soil moisture based on {MODIS} images in arid regions
VL  - 98
SN  - NA
AB  - Knowledge of spatial distributions of soil moisture, particularly at large spatial scales, is critical for many practical reasons. Unlike point-scale measurements, remote sensing provides an efficient way to estimate soil moisture over large areas. By resampling MODIS images with different scaling techniques, the impacts of those scaling methods on accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from MODIS data was first investigated using in situ soil moisture measurements. A soil moisture retrieval model was then constructed to obtain and analyse the spatial pattern of soil moisture in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region of China in 2007. The following results were obtained. (1) With the process of spatial scale increases, the value of goodness-of-fit of the model change is relatively large, showing a strong randomness. (2) With resampling scales for 2 and 4 km when compared with measured data, correlation coefficient showed apparent fluctuation. With increased scale sampling, random changes in the model appeared to fluctuate less. Comparison of six different scaling methods, the results indicated that soil moisture retrieval model showed better correlation and higher accuracy of fitting under the scaling method of 2 km, respectively, followed by 1 and 16 km. (3) In order to test the accuracy of the retrieval model, the distribution of soil moisture was analysed by using of satellite image of the study area and retrieval of in situ soil moisture data, the data demonstrated high consistency with fieldwork. Evidence thus indicates that 2 km Ã— 2 km is a significant level for retrieval distribution of soil moisture in the study area. The results also provide some reference for land-use planning and policy-making of sustainable utilisation of land resources. Â© 2016 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - The {Development} and {Evaluation} of a {Time} {Domain} {Reflectometry} {Probe} for {Soil} {Moisture} and {Suction} {Measurement
VL  - 2016-January
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture and suction are two key variables that often need to be measured for unsaturated soil. They are commonly measured by separate soil moisture and suction sensors which require double installation efforts and often result in questionable correlation between the measured moisture and suction. Attempts were made to combine time domain reflectometry (TDR) and porous blocks functioning as tensiometers and have demonstrated a great potential of the TDR for simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and suction. In this study, a new TDR moisture-suction probe is designed based on the previous study, and it was evaluated in laboratory for simultaneous measurements of moisture content and soil suction. The probe has two parts with one half portion embedded in a dental plaster (i.e. gypsum) for soil suction measurements, whose suction is equilibrated with the surrounding soils. The other half portion of the probe is also inserted into the soils to measure moisture content. The probe calibration was completed by the use of pressure plate tests to establish a relationship between suction (Î©) and measured dielectric constant (Ka) of the gypsum block. Then, it was tested in a silty sand to evaluate its function for soil moisture and suction measurement. The preliminary test results demonstrated that the change of Ka of the gypsum corresponded well to suction level from 10 to 750 kPa, and it can measure moisture content and soil suction accurately for the test soils. The new probe can be fabricated easily and fast, without any additional maintenance and has a great potential for field measurement of soil moisture and suction.

TI  - From point to pixel scale: {An} upscaling approach for in situ soil moisture measurements
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Given the high spatial variability of soil moisture content (SMC), direct comparison and integration of observations from different sources and measurement scales is becoming a major challenge. We have developed a spatial upscaling method for SMC that enables the direct combination of in situ measurements and remotely sensed data. The approach is based on the fact that spatial soil moisture patterns are related to ancillary features like topography, land cover, and soil type. This study used in situ data from a well-equipped research site in the northern Italian Alps. One of the main goals was to enable the use of these data for the validation of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products. Dealing with medium- to coarse-resolution satellite imagery, especially in mountain areas, requires compensating for different measurement scales. The study approach was assessed based on Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) data, which were resampled to reproduce the spatial scale of the SMAP data. Results show that the representativeness of in situ data, with respect to the 3- by 3-km SMAP pixel scale, can be improved significantlyâ€”direct correlation between SMC and satellite backscatter was improved from R = 0.05 to 0.28; furthermore, the error of the estimated SMC was improved from RMSE = 0.12 to 0.03 m3 mâˆ’3. This leads to more accurate reference data, which can help to improve the retrieval of SMC from remotely sensed imagery. Â© Soil Science Society of America.

TI  - Long-{Term} effects of controlled-release urea on crop yields and soil fertility under wheatâ€“corn double cropping systems
VL  - 108
SN  - NA
AB  - The long-term effects of controlled-release urea (CRU) on crop yields and soil properties were investigated in lysimeters under wheat and corn rotation system from 2009 to 2014 in northern China. The CRU included polymer-coated urea (PCU), sulfur-coated urea (SCU), and polymer coating of sulfur-coated urea (PSCU) was applied at 147, 210 kg N haâ€“1 for wheat and 262.5, 375 kg N haâ€“1 for corn and the urea was applied at 210 kg N haâ€“1 for wheat and 375 kg N haâ€“1 for corn. Results showed that the N release characteristics of three kinds of CRU in field condition were all closely matched to the N requirement of crops. Consequently, the CRU treatments improved wheat and corn yields by 3.2 to 10.1\% and 4.9 to 11.1\%, increased apparent N use efficiency by 45.9 to 53.8\% in wheat, and 36.2 to 45.4\% in corn, respectively, compared with urea. Furthermore, the PSCU achieved the highest and the most stable crop yields among CRU. Even reducing CRU rate by 30\% produced the same yields as with the 100\% rate of urea. In addition, soil total N and organic matter contents in CRU were effectively increased in the topsoil of 0 to 20 cm after 5 yr. Therefore, long-term application of CRU had great potential to increase wheatâ€“corn yields, N use efficiency, reduce application frequency, improve soil fertility, decrease the leaching of soil NO3â€“â€“N and NH4+â€“N, and also relieve soil pH decreased.

VL  - 162
SN  - NA
AB  - This study evaluates the capability of soil water content predicted from remote sensing to indicate the soil/canopy water content at short time and space scale, through comparisons with daily soil moisture data determined in situ, using dielectric devices. Daily aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the diurnal (daytime and night time) land surface temperature difference (DLST) are employed to retrieving daily volumetric soil moisture content (Î¸) at Sparta experimental station, during the period June-August, of the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Using the concept of apparent thermal inertia (ATI) in the remotely sensed topsoil moisture saturation index, daily Î¸ is obtained from DLST and the volumetric saturated and residual soil moisture content and is compared with the experimental values of volumetric soil moisture content (SM) measured at various depths (10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm). Simple relationships are also calibrated between SM and ATI or DLST or NDVI during the years 2010, 2011 and 2014 and are tested for predicting Î¸, during the year 2012. Especially the three first models predict Î¸ satisfactorily as compared with the measured SM and hence they can offer a considerable guidance in irrigated agriculture and other related fields.

VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrients are essential for crop growth. Spatial variability of nutrients can occur in various scales, between regions, between fields or within the field. RS and GIS techniques enables farm management based on small-scale spatial variability of soil and crop parameters in the field. The present study was carried out in Nagenahalli microwatershed, Doddaballapur taluk, Bangalore rural district with the objective to determine and map the macronutrient status of soils in the watershed using GIS technique. The NPK was analyzed and mapped using Arc GIS to quantify the level of spatial nutrients availability. Results indicated that NPK ranged from 31.36 to 376.32 kg ha-1(N), 21.29 to 390.62 kg ha-1 (P2O5) and 55.10 to 521.47 kg ha-1 (K2O) respectively in the surface soils. Nutrient map showed that the soils were poor in available nitrogen and available potassium whereas sufficient in available phosphorous content. Furthermore NPK map can be used to identify deficient or sufficient areas for efficient fertilizer management.

TI  - Soil moisture content detection based on sensor networks
VL  - 9784
SN  - NA
AB  - With rapidly development of wireless communications and electronics, precision agriculture turns into a promising application of the sensor networks. In this paper, the measurement of volumetric moisture content for soil is explored with the sensor networks. The method of high-frequency capacitance is applied to the moisture content detection for three kinds of arable soil: red soil, moisture soil and paddy soil. First of all, the measuring principle is analyzed: high-frequency equivalent electronic model of soil test plate is serially connected with constant inductor, so as to obtain the relation between the equivalent capacitance and resonance. Then we measure the correspondence between resonance frequency and soil volumetric moisture content through experimental methods, in addition, the impact of resonance frequency range and environmental temperature is analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on soil moisture content detection based on high-frequency capacitance covering circuit theory, hardware simulation, resonance-frequency selection, temperature compensation and sensor networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, thus, our method possesses significant application value. Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Farmersâ€™ perception of soil fertility change and their preferences for soil fertility management techniques for different land use types in {Arsamma} {Watershed}, {Southwestern} {Ethiopian} {Highlands
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - This study aimed to assess farmersâ€™ perception of soil fertility change and their priorities for soil fertility management techniques for different land use types in Arsamma Watershed, Southwestern Ethiopian Highlands. A three-stage random sampling technique was employed to select the sampled households. A smaller proportion of farmers perceived soil fertility decline in perennial cropland than in annual cropland as the farmers appeared to be less aware of below-ground processes of soil degradation. The farmers used physical, chemical and biological indicators to evaluate soil fertility changes. The rate of soil fertility decline and the occurrence of the contributory factors were land use specific. Increasing fertilizer requirement of croplands and decreasing yield per unit of land were the main indicators of soil fertility decline in annual and perennial cropland, respectively. Farmersâ€™ preference for soil fertility management techniques was also found to depend on the type of land use. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and agroforestry were the top priorities of the farmers, respectively, for annual and perennial cropland management. Farmers lack knowledge of below-ground processes of soil degradation by leaching, nutrient mining and soil acidity; and agricultural extension services should respond to this need. Further, ISFM for annual cropland and agroforestry for perennial cropland need to be encouraged in the study catchment. Â© 2015 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Soil nutrient additions increase invertebrate herbivore abundances, but not herbivory, across three grassland systems
VL  - 180
SN  - NA
AB  - Resource availability may influence invertebrate communities, with important consequences for ecosystem function, such as biomass production. We assessed: (1) the effects of experimental soil nutrient additions on invertebrate abundances and feeding rates and (2) the resultant changes in the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass at three grassland sites spanning the North American Central Plains, across which plant tissue chemistry and biomass vary. Invertebrate communities and rates of herbivory were sampled within a long-term nutrient-addition experiment established at each site along the broad Central Plains precipitation gradient. Additionally, the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass were determined under ambient and elevated nutrient conditions. At the more mesic sites, invertebrate herbivore abundances increased and their per capita rate of herbivory decreased with nutrient additions. In contrast, at the semi-arid site where plant biomass is low and plant nutrient concentrations are high, invertebrate herbivore abundances did not vary and per capita rates of herbivory increased with nutrient additions. No change in the effect of invertebrate herbivores on aboveground plant biomass was observed at any of the sites. In sum, nutrient additions induced shifts in both plant biomass and leaf nutrient content, which altered invertebrate abundances and feeding rate. However, due to the inverse relationship between changes in herbivore abundance and per capita rates of herbivory, nutrient additions did not alter the effect of invertebrates on aboveground biomass. Overall, we suggest that this inverse response of herbivore abundance and per capita feeding rate may buffer ecosystems against changes in invertebrate damage in response to fluctuations in nutrient levels.

TI  - DisPATCh} as a tool to evaluate coarse-scale remotely sensed soil moisture using localized in situ measurements: {Application} to {SMOS} and {AMSR}-{E} data in {Southeastern} {Australia
VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - Validating coarse-scale satellite soil moisture data still represents a big challenge, notably due to the large mismatch existing between the spatial resolution ({\textgreater} 10 km) of microwave radiometers and the representativeness scale (several m) of localized in situ measurements. This study aims to examine the potential of DisPATCh (Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical scale Change) for validating SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth observation system) level-3 soil moisture products. The âˆ½40â€“50 km resolution SMOS and AMSR-E data are disaggregated at 1 km resolution over the Murrumbidgee catchment in Southeastern Australia during a one year period in 2010â€“2011, and the satellite products are compared with the in situ measurements of 38 stations distributed within the study area. It is found that disaggregation improves the mean difference, correlation coefficient and slope of the linear regression between satellite and in situ data in 77\%, 92\% and 94\% of cases, respectively. Nevertheless, the downscaling efficiency is lower in winter than during the hotter months when DisPATCh performance is optimal. Consistently, better results are obtained in the semi-arid than in a temperate zone of the catchment. In the semi-arid Yanco region, disaggregation in summer increases the correlation coefficient from 0.63 to 0.78 and from 0.42 to 0.71 for SMOS and AMSR-E in morning overpasses and from 0.37 to 0.63 and from 0.47 to 0.73 for SMOS and AMSR-E in afternoon overpasses, respectively. DisPATCh has strong potential in low vegetated semi-arid areas where it can be used as a tool to evaluate coarse-scale remotely sensed soil moisture by explicitly representing the sub-pixel variability.

TI  - Towards pervasive soil moisture sensing using {RFID} tag antenna-based sensors
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - An RFID-based passive sensor for pervasive soil moisture monitoring is proposed. Variations in moisture cause a change in soil permittivity which in turn affects the impedance match/mismatch between the tag chip and the sensor probe. This manifests itself as a change in the RFID tag backscatter signal strength which can be detected at the reader. The concept is validated through a series of experiments conducted on sand and clay in two different settings. Variations in soil moisture content, as small as 20mL could be detected from a distance of 0.8 m. Â© 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The JOLISAA project analysed a number of multi-stakeholder innovation cases in smallholder agriculture in Benin, Kenya and South Africa through a Collaborative Case Assessment process. The overriding assumption was that a comparative analysis of wide ranging innovation experiences may provide useful insights into the way that innovation processes are triggered and unfold in smallholder agricultural systems. One of the cases investigated in South Africa was from Limpopo Province. This was a project-based innovation processes, initiated to redress how agricultural and social development in rural communities should be addressed through the adoption of the Participatory Extension Approach (PEA). The approach focused on the reorientation of mindsets in Limpopo Department of Agricultural, which were still founded on the teaching of linear transfer of technology models, and where farmers were approached with a believe that extension have all the answers to farmer problems. Participatory Rural Appraisal methodologies were used to interview smallholder farmers and key informants. It was revealed that this was a case of an innovation bundle where the main innovation was an institutional innovation, with the introduction of PEA through the GTZ/BASED program. The aim was to broaden agricultural service and extension delivery to smallholder farmers in the Vhembe district. In the unpacking of the soil fertility management innovation it was revealed that the innovation consists of a number of innovations, which include technical and organisation innovations. The GTZ/BASED program trained some 700 extensionists in the PEA methodology, capacitating them to facilitate technical innovations amongst smallholders in one of four technical areas. A total of 397 villages were eventually served. The extensionists specialising in soil fertility management teamed up with a local university to redress a severe decline in soil fertility in two smallholder irrigation schemes, Rammbuda and Mphaila. Together with farmers they experimented with innovative ways like green manuring with forage legumes. These technical innovation processes created capacity amongst smallholders that triggered spontaneous farmer-initiated experimentation and innovation processes to improve smallholder farming systems and livelihoods. The key challenge identified was that decisive institutional ownership is required to sustain an enabling environment allowing innovation processes to continue beyond the project phase. The key lesson was that project initiated innovations could trigger farmer innovations and that developmental change strategies should explore such opportunities.

TI  - Determinants of the adoption of integrated soil fertility management technologies in {Mbale} division, {Kenya
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - The agro-climatic conditions in western Kenya present the region as a food surplus area yet people are still reliant on food imports, with the region registering high poverty levels. Depletion of soil fertility and the resulting decline in agricultural productivity in Mbale division has led to many attempts to develop and popularize Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) technologies that could restore soil fertility. These technologies bridge the gap between high external inputs and extreme forms of traditional low external input agriculture. Some of the ISFM components used by farmers are organic and inorganic inputs and improved seeds. However, the adoption of these technologies is low. The study aimed to examine the factors that influence the adoption of ISFM technologies by smallholder farmers in Mbale division, Kenya. The study was conducted in 9 sub-locations in Mbale division. Purposive sampling was used in selecting the 80 farmers to get the data based on a farm-household survey. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on the determinants of the adoption of ISFM technologies from the sampled farmers in the study area. The study sought to answer the research question: What factors influence the uptake of ISFM technologies by farmers in Mbale division? The hypothesis tested was that the adoption of ISFM technologies is not influenced by age, education, extension services, labour, off-farm income and farm size. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Cross tabulation was used for examining the relationship between categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables, and the bivariate correlations procedure was used to compute the pair wise associations between scale or ordinal variables. Probit regression was used to predict the socio-economic factors influencing the adoption of ISFM technologies among smallholder farmers. Results of the study indicated that education of household head, membership in social groups, age of the household head, off-farm income and farm size were the variables that significantly influenced the adoption of ISFM technologies. The findings show that there is need for a more pro-poor focused approach to achieve sustainable soil fertility management among smallholder farmers. The findings will help farmers, extension officers, researchers and donors in identifying region-specific entry points that can help in developing innovative ISFM technologies.

TI  - Soil nitrogen and tea leaf properties in organic and conventional farming systems under humid sub-tropical conditions
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - The effects of organic (OFS) and conventional (CFS) farming systems on soil nitrogen and tea (Camellia sinensis L.) leaf physiological as well as biochemical properties under humid sub-tropical conditions were studied at the experimental field of Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat, Assam, India. A part of the field under CFS was converted to organic in 2008 by using different organic manures, viz., vermicompost, P-enriched vermicompost, de-oiled neem cake, and inserting green crop, besides phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) solubilizing bacteria. After 4 years of conversion process, OFS resulted in significantly higher values for leaf total catechin (262.03 mg gâˆ’1), (âˆ’)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, 159.97 mg gâˆ’1), and (âˆ’)-epicatechin gallate (ECG, 42.93 mg gâˆ’1) contents although there was up to 22 \% reduction in tea yield. On the other hand, CFS resulted in significantly higher values for soil available nitrogen (154 mg kgâˆ’1) contents as well as for leaf chlorophyll a (2.51 mg kgâˆ’1), chlorophyll b (1.02 mg kgâˆ’1), and total chlorophyll (3.53 mg kgâˆ’1), contents. No significant difference was observed for caffeine, (âˆ’)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (+)-catechin (C), and (âˆ’)-epicatechin (EC) contents between the two farming systems studied. Correlation analysis indicated that (âˆ’)-EGCG was the major catechin fraction significantly correlated with leaf chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents. The present study has provided knowledge on soil available nitrogen as well as leaf physiological and biochemical contents in tea shoots under humid sub-tropical conditions in Northeast India.

TI  - Sampling layer for soil fertility evaluation in long-term no-tillage systems
VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - In no-tillage (NT) systems, there is no plowed layer since the soil is not tilled. Thus, the soil layer for fertility evaluation can be defined as the one in which the fertility indices are affected by the surface application of lime and fertilizers and soil properties have the closest relationship with crop yields. The objective of this study was to determine the most appropriate soil layer under long-term NT for sampling for fertility evaluation in the South-Central region of ParanÃ¡, Brazil. A total of 99 field experiments of crop rotations were performed, including soybean, corn, barley, wheat, and white oat, all on Oxisols (Hapludox). Despite the surface application, lime and fertilizers increased base saturation (V) and available K to a depth of 0.20 m. The relationship with crop yields was high for V and low for available K for both soil layers (0.00-0.10 and 0.00-0.20 m); for P, however, the relationships with soybean and corn yields were strongest in the 0.00-0.20 m layer. Thus, considering the soil layer fertilized by the surface application of lime and potassium fertilizers and the highest relationship of soil P contents with the yield of the main crops of the crop rotation, the 0.00-0.20 m layer is the most appropriate for soil fertility evaluation under long-term no-tillage systems.

TI  - Relation between various soil phosphorus extraction methods and sorption parameters in calcareous soils with different texture
VL  - 566-567
SN  - NA
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil texture on phosphorus (P) extractability and sorption from a wide range of calcareous soils across Hamedan, western Iran. Fifty seven soil samples were selected and partitioned into five types on the basis of soil texture (clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam and mixed loam) and the P extracted with calcium chloride (PCaCl2), citrate (Pcitrate), HCl (PHCl), Olsen (POls), and Mehlich-3 (PM3) solutions. On the average, the P extracted was in the order PHCl {\textgreater} PM3 {\textgreater} Pcitrate {\textgreater} POls {\textgreater} PCaCl2. The P extracted by Pcitrate, PHCl, POls, and PM3 methods were significantly higher in sandy, sandy clay loam and sandy loam textures than clay and mixed loam textures, while soil phosphorus buffer capacity (PBC) was significantly higher in clay and mixed loam soil textures. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between silt content Freundlich sorption coefficient (KF), maximum P sorption (Qmax), linear distribution coefficient (Kd), and PBC. All extractions were highly correlated with each other and among soil components with silt content. The principal component analysis (PCA) performed on data identified five principal components describing 74.5\% of total variation. The results point to soil texture as an important factor and that silt was the crucial soil property associated with P sorption and its extractability in these calcareous soils. DPSM3-2 (PM3PM3+QmaxÃ—100) and DPScitrate (PcitratePcitrate+QmaxÃ—100) proved to be good indicators of soil's potential P release in these calcareous soils. Among the DPS, 21\% of soils reported DPSM3-2, values higher than the environmental threshold, indicating build-up of P and P release. Most of the studied sandy clay loam soils had exceeded the environmentally unacceptable P concentration. Various management practices should be taken into account to reduce P losses from these soils. Further inorganic and organic P fertilizer inputs should be reduced in some parts of studied area. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil phosphorus compounds in integrated crop-livestock systems of subtropical {Brazil
VL  - 274
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) utilization may be affected by agricultural complexity, in particular when combining annual crops and livestock grazing on the same land area and at overlapping times. Our objectives were to qualify and quantify soil organic and inorganic P compounds using sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extraction and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P NMR) in response to increasing complexity with integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) in subtropical Brazil. Soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was collected from three long-term (7 to 12 years) cropping studies with and without ruminant grazing of cover crops. All sites were managed under no tillage, and treatments with livestock were managed with moderate grazing intensity. In these agro-ecosystems, grazing compared with no-grazing had greater soil P content as total and bioavailable orthophosphate and lower soil organic P and fewer monoesters, including inositol phosphates. Grazing increased P bioavailability and reduced recalcitrant organic P concentration in soil; therefore, cropping systems that integrate livestock (ICLS) can be a sustainable alternative to improve P use in farming systems of subtropical Brazil.

TI  - Spatial distribution of soil nutrients in a watershed of {Himalayan} landscape using terrain attributes and geostatistical methods
VL  - 75
SN  - NA
AB  - Terrain attributes derived from digital terrain model (DTM) were used to study spatial variation of total soil C, N and available P in surface soils of a watershed of Himalayan landscape. Terrain attributes elevation, slope gradient and upslope catchment area (UCA) and terrain indices [terrain wetness index (TWI), water power index (WPI) and sediment transport index (STI)] were derived from DTM and evaluated for their potential in soil nutrients mapping. These nutrients showed positive correlation with UCA, TWI, SPI and STP terrain indices. Among these terrain indices, TWI showed highest correlation coefficient for TC (r2 = 0.71), N (r2 = 0.67) and P (r2 = 0.66) followed by WPI and STI. Geostatistical analyses used to map these nutrients, co-kriging with TWI + NDVI, TWI and slope as co-variables, had improved the spatial prediction to 60.46, 55.81, 44.18 \% for TC and 33.63, 21.78, 17.82 \% for N, respectively, contrary to ordinary kriging. The prediction accuracy for P was improved with co-variables of TWI + NDVI and TWI by 30.03 and 4.50 \%, respectively. The study clearly revealed that by integrating NDVI as co-variable has significantly improved the accuracy for TC followed by N and P. TWI alone as co-variable has improved the spatial prediction significantly. Â© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Doubled-up legume rotations improve soil fertility and maintain productivity under variable conditions in maize-based cropping systems in {Malawi
VL  - 145
SN  - NA
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Malawi must cope with small farm size, low soil fertility and production risks associated with rainfed agriculture. Integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems is advocated as a means to increase production of diverse nutrient-dense grains and improve soil fertility. It is difficult to achieve both aims simultaneously, however. Short-duration grain legumes rarely produce enough biomass to appreciatively improve soils, and long duration pigeonpea, commonly grown in Malawi as a dual purpose crop, produces little or no edible grain as a consequence of grain-filling into the dry season. A novel technology is the doubled-up legume rotation (DLR) system in which two legumes with complementary phenology are intercropped and grown in rotation with maize. Initial performance from on-farm research is favorable; however, it is crucial to understand competition for resources in mixed cropping systems under variable soil and climate conditions. We used soil and crop yield data from farmer participatory trials to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and evaluate its performance in simulating observed treatments at three locations in central Malawi. We used the calibrated APSIM model to investigate the performance of DLR and other maize-based systems across 26 growing seasons (1979-2005) in the three agroecologies. We simulated two DLR systems (maize rotated with a groundnut/pigeonpea or soybean/pigeonpea intercrop), maize rotated with groundnut or soybean, maize intercropped with pigeonpea, and continuous maize under a range of N fertilizer inputs. We extended findings to the household level by determining calorie and protein yields of these systems, and calculating the chance that an average household could meet their food requirements by dedicating all available farmland to a given system. Simulated maize grain yields in DLR and maize-grain legume rotations were essentially equivalent, and exceeded yields in maize/pigeonpea intercrop and sole cropped maize receiving comparable fertility inputs. All rotation systems were more likely to meet household calorie and protein needs than other systems receiving equivalent inputs. DLR systems accumulated higher total soil C and N over time than traditional rotation systems in areas where pigeonpea performed well. However, the effects of improved soil fertility on maize yields were counterbalanced by factors including N immobilization and water availability. We conclude that where growing conditions allow, DLR can harness the complementary phenology of pigeonpea to build soil quality for the future without reducing maize yields or compromising household food production in the immediate term.

TI  - The {LAB}-net soil moisture network: {Application} to thermal remote sensing and surface energy balance
VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - A set of Essential Climate Variables (ECV) have been defined to be monitored by current and new remote sensing missions. The ECV retrieved at global scale need to be validated in order to provide reliable products to be used in remote sensing applications. For this, test sites are required to use in calibration and validation of the remote sensing approaches in order to improve the ECV retrievals at global scale. The southern hemisphere presents scarce test sites for calibration and validation field campaigns that focus on soil moisture and land surface temperature retrievals. In Chile, remote sensing applications related to soil moisture estimates have increased during the last decades because of the drought and water use conflicts that generate a strong interest on improved water demand estimates. This work describes the Laboratory for Analysis of the Biosphere (LAB)â€”NETwork, called herein after â€˜LAB-netâ€™, which was designed to be the first network in Chile for remote sensing applications. The test sites were placed in four sites with different cover types: vineyards and olive orchards located in the semi-arid region of Atacama, an irrigated raspberry crop in the Mediterranean climate zone of Chimbarongo, and a rainfed pasture in the south of Chile. Over each site, well implemented meteorological and radiative flux instrumentation was installed and continuously recorded the following parameters: soil moisture and temperature at two ground levels (10 and 20 cm), air temperature and relative humidity, net radiation, global radiation, radiometric temperature (8â€“14 Âµm), rainfall and soil heat flux. The LAB-net data base post-processing procedure is also described here. As an application, surface remote sensing products such as soil moisture data derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) extracted from the MODIS-MOD11A1 and GOES LST from Copernicus products were compared to in situ data in Oromo LAB-net site. Moreover, land surface energy flux estimation is also shown as an application of LAB-net data base. These applications revealed a good performance between in situ and remote sensing data. LAB-net data base also contributes to provide suitable information for land surface energy budget and therefore water resources management at cultivars scale. The data based generated by LAB-net is freely available for any research or scientific purpose related to current and future remote sensing applications.

TI  - Soil nitrogen and its fractions between long-term conventional and no-tillage systems with straw retention in dryland farming in northern {China
VL  - 269
SN  - NA
AB  - Knowledge about the changes in soil nitrogen pools under different tillage managements is necessary to assess the feasibility of adoption of conservation practices for sustaining productivity and protecting the environment in dryland farming in northern China. We investigated the long-term effects (22 years) of no-till with residue retention (NTR) on total soil N and its fractions in a dry-land winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in northern China. Compared with conventional tillage without residue retention (CT), significantly higher soil total N (STN) concentrations were observed in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) under NTR. Meanwhile, more soil N accumulated for the whole soil profile (0 to 60 cm) in the NTR (3.38 Mg ha-1) treatment relative to the CT (3.17 Mg ha-1) treatment. The particulate organic matter N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), and water extractable organic N (WEON) levels in the NTR treatments were 52.3\%, 116\%, and 69.4\% greater at a depth of 0-5 cm and 41.6\%, 108\%, and 44.9\% greater at a depth of 5-10 cm, respectively, compared with the CT treatment. However, no differences were observed below the 10 cm layer. At a depth of 0-60 cm, the soil NH4-N content under CT was higher than that under NTR. However, the soil NO3-N contents in the NTR treatments were significantly greater at a depth of 0-10 cm and were not significantly different at a depth of 10-60 cm, relative to the CT treatment. Significantly positive correlations were observed between the STN and the labile organic N fractions. Overall, the results show that no-till coupled with residue retention is an effective management method for improving soil N stocks and increasing soil fertility. Nonetheless, other benefits associated with NT and residue retention present greater challenges regarding their popularization and application in the dryland farming areas in northern China.

AB  - Traditional yam-based cropping systems (shifting cultivation, slash-and-burn, and short fallow) often result in deforestation and soil nutrient depletion. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of yam-based systems with herbaceous legumes on dry matter (DM) production (tubers, shoots), nutrients removed and recycled, and the soil fertility changes. We compared smallholders' traditional systems (1-year fallow of Andropogon gayanus-yam rotation, maize-yam rotation) with yam-based systems integrated herbaceous legumes (Aeschynomene histrix/maize intercropping-yam rotation, Mucuna pruriens/maize intercropping-yam rotation). The experiment was conducted during the 2002 and 2004 cropping seasons with 32 farmers, eight in each site. For each of them, a randomized complete block design with four treatments and four replicates was carried out using a partial nested model with five factors: Year, Replicate, Farmer, Site, and Treatment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the general linear model (GLM) procedure was applied to the dry matter (DM) production (tubers, shoots), nutrient contribution to the systems, and soil properties at depths 0-10 and 10-20 cm. DM removed and recycled, total N, P, and K recycled or removed, and soil chemical properties (SOM, N, P, K, and pH water) were significantly improved on yam-based systems with legumes in comparison with traditional systems.

TI  - Optimizing {Soil} {Fertility} {Gradients} in the {Enset} ({Ensete} ventricosum) {Systems} of the {Ethiopian} {Highlands}: {Trade}-offs and {Local} {Innovations
VL  - 63
SN  - NA
AB  - Ensete ventricosum is a perennial, security crop that feeds about 13 million people in Ethiopia. It is grown in the homesteads, covering about 18\% of the farm, in mixture with Coffee, kale, and other vegetables. The recent shift from enset to cereals and continual soil fertility decline in the outfields caused food deficit for at least three months in a year. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of soil fertility gradients on enset growth, identify the major growth limiting nutrients, and identify farmersâ€™ decision making criteria in allocating resources to various enterprises. The research was conducted on farmerâ€™s fields of resource rich (G1) and poor (G3) for four years (2001â€“2004). Enset transplants were planted in homestead and outfields. Application of fertilizers by farmers to different units over seasons and years was recorded. Enset growth and nutrient content was measured. The results showed that the G1 group produced about 2xs more organic waste than G3, and purchased chemical fertilizers 5xs more than the G3 farmers. About 80\% of the organic resource produced was allocated for maintaining soil fertility, while 20\% being allocated as cooking fuel. Of this 65\% is allocated for the enset field in the homestead. There were significantly higher N, P, K and Ca contents in the homestead soils than in the outfield, regardless of farmersâ€™ resource endowment. The P content of the outfield was the lowest, less than 25\% of the P content of the homestead. Similarly organic matter in the outfield was only about 40\% of the homestead. Enset plants grown in the outfields experienced about 90\% height reduction and 50\% reduction in pseudo stem diameter, regardless of resource categories, while the NPK content of the plant tissues grown in the outfield was significantly higher, in some case up to 150\% than those planted in homestead. We thus concluded that growth reduction in the outfield was not directly related to NPK deficiency, but it could have been caused by off-season moisture stress in the outfields, manifested by low soil organic matter. The attempt to attract resources to the outfield using enset as an attractant crop failed, not because of labour shortage but because of unavailability of enough organic resources in the system. Hence on spot management of nutrients was initiated by farmers. Â© 2007 Springer.

TI  - A method for retrieving soil moisture from {GNSS}-{R} by using experiment data
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter in agricultural irrigation. The L band (1.58 GHz) on board global position system (GPS) satellite is well suited for monitoring the change of soil moisture. In order to investigate the potential of retrieving soil moisture using the L-band GPS bistatic radar, this paper analyzed a retrieval method by using field experiment data. In order to investigate the relationship between the soil moisture (corresponding roughly to the 0 5 cm top soil layer) and the signal-to-noise ratio (Pr-SNR) to the direct GPS signal-to-noise ratio (Pd-SNR), an experiment was conducted in Hulunber grassland of China in 2009 and 2011. Six field sites in the soil moisture experiment were utilized to analyze the relationship between soil moisture and the ratio of Pr-SNR to Pd-SNR and the square of correlation coefficient was about 0.9 when the surface type was known and the elevation angle of the satellite ranged from 65 to 85 degrees approximately. The analysis shows that ratio of Pr-SNR to Pd-SNR can be used to monitor the soil moisture, because the ratio of Pr-SNR to Pd-SNR maximized the elimination of the influence of different signals from different GPS satellites. The estimation accuracy could be improved if we make full use of the empirical knowledge on elevation angles of GPS satellites and ground roughness of different surface types.

TI  - Investigating temporal field sampling strategies for site-specific calibration of three soil moisture-neutron intensity parameterisation methods
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - The Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) can provide soil moisture information at scales relevant to hydrometeorological modelling applications. Site-specific calibration is needed to translate CRNS neutron intensities into sensor footprint average soil moisture contents. We investigated temporal sampling strategies for calibration of three CRNS parameterisations (modified N0, HMF, and COSMIC) by assessing the effects of the number of sampling days and soil wetness conditions on the performance of the calibration results while investigating actual neutron intensity measurements, for three sites with distinct climate and land use: a semi-arid site, a temperate grassland, and a temperate forest. When calibrated with 1 year of data, both COSMIC and the modified N0 method performed better than HMF. The performance of COSMIC was remarkably good at the semi-arid site in the USA, while the N0mod performed best at the two temperate sites in Germany. The successful performance of COSMIC at all three sites can be attributed to the benefits of explicitly resolving individual soil layers (which is not accounted for in the other two parameterisations). To better calibrate these parameterisations, we recommend in situ soil sampled to be collected on more than a single day. However, little improvement is observed for sampling on more than 6 days. At the semi-arid site, the N0mod method was calibrated better under site-specific average wetness conditions, whereas HMF and COSMIC were calibrated better under drier conditions. Average soil wetness condition gave better calibration results at the two humid sites. The calibration results for the HMF method were better when calibrated with combinations of days with similar soil wetness conditions, opposed to N0mod and COSMIC, which profited from using days with distinct wetness conditions. Errors in actual neutron intensities were translated to average errors specifically to each site. At the semi-arid site, these errors were below the typical measurement uncertainties from in situ point-scale sensors and satellite remote sensing products. Nevertheless, at the two humid sites, reduction in uncertainty with increasing sampling days only reached typical errors associated with satellite remote sensing products. The outcomes of this study can be used by researchers as a CRNS calibration strategy guideline. Â© Author(s) 2015.

VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - The importance of different agroforestry systems in conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated tree diversity, carbon stocks, and major soil nutrients in cocoa-dominated and mixed food crops agroforests compared to a natural forest in southern Ghana. Significant decreases in tree species diversity and dominance and carbon stocks in the agroforestry systems compared to natural forest were recorded. The magnitude of carbon stocks declined from natural forest through cocoa-dominated agroforest to mixed food crops agroforest. Soil nitrogen content was greatest in cocoa-dominated agroforest and least in natural forest whereas phosphorus was greatest in natural forest and least in cocoa-dominated agroforest. However, potassium in soil did not vary significantly with land use. The results suggest that, though a poor substitute for natural forest, both cocoa-dominated agroforest and mixed food crops agroforest contained significant levels of tree diversity, carbon stocks and soil nutrients but their value as potential replacements for the natural forest differ. There are implications of the findings of the study for sustainable management of tropical agricultural production landscapes as well as planning carbon projects for mitigation of global climate change.

VL  - 63
SN  - NA
AB  - Field experiments in 2010 and 2011 was conducted to evaluate the effect of integrated weed management practices on productivity, nutrient uptake, nutrient harvest index and residual soil fertility status in wetland rice (Oryza sativa L.) under different establishment methods. Wetland rice under system of rice intensification (SRI) method gave significantly higher grain productivity. However, hand weeding twice at 20 and 40 days after transplanting (DAT) was similar with butachlor 50 EC at 1.5 kg a.i. ha-1 at 3 DAT + cono-weeding at 20 DAT. Total uptake of N, P and K by wetland rice was recorded higher with SRI followed by integrated crop management and conventional rice culture. Hand weeding twice at 20 and 40 DAT recorded significantly higher N, P and K uptake in grain and straw followed by butachlor 50 EC at 1.5 kg a.i. ha-1 at 3 DAT + cono-weeding at 20 DAT. The highest nitrogen harvest index (NHI), phosphorus harvest index (PHI) and potassium harvest index (KHI) (79.8, 58.8 and 36.6\%), respectively were recorded with cono-weeding twice at 20 and 40 DAT. The residual soil pH, OC, MBC and available N, P and K was significantly higher in SRI method with hand weeding twice at 20 and 40 DAT. Hence, integrated weed management with butachlor 50 EC at 1.5 kg a.i. ha-1 + cono-weeding at 20 DAT performed well under SRI method. However, hand weeding twice at 20 and 40 DAT performed better under ICM method in terms of productivity and better soil health in wetland rice ecosystem. Â© 2015, IndianJournals.com.

AB  - The 'Risk management through soil moisture monitoring' project has demonstrated the capability of current technology to remotely monitor and communicate real time soil moisture data. The project investigated whether capacitance probes would assist making informed pre- and in-crop decisions. Crop potential and cropping inputs are increasingly being subject to greater instability and uncertainty due to seasonal variability. In a targeted survey of those who received regular correspondence from the Department of Primary Industries it was found that i) 50\% of the audience found the information generated relevant for them and less than 10\% indicted with was not relevant; ii) 85\% have improved their knowledge/ability to assess soil moisture compared to prior to the project, with the most used indicator of soil moisture still being rain fall records; and iii) 100\% have indicated they will continue to use some form of the technology to monitor soil moisture levels in the future. It is hoped that continued access to this information will assist informed input decisions. This will minimise inputs in low decile years with a low soil moisture base and maximise yield potential in more favourable conditions based on soil moisture and positive seasonal forecasts Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Can agroforestry improve soil fertility and carbon storage in smallholder banana farming systems?
VL  - 178
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility depletion is a major constraint to agricultural production for smallholder farming households in many sub-Saharan countries, and it is worsened by climate variability. In order to sustain food security for a growing population, measures have to be taken against C and nutrient losses from soils. This study examines whether banana-coffee agroforestry systems can improve soil fertility and C pools in smallholder farms in E Africa amidst observed climate variability. We selected 20 farms in Central Uganda, where soil samples were obtained from the top and subsoil layers. Samples were analyzed for several soil fertility parameters including soil organic matter (SOM), total soil organic C, pH, total N, plant-available P, exchangeable K, texture, and bulk density. Soil C stocks were calculated based on soil organic C concentrations and bulky density. We measured tree diameter and height and calculated aboveground plant biomass using allometric equations. Belowground biomass was estimated using equations based on the respective aboveground plant biomass. Our results show that banana-coffee agroforestry farming systems had significantly higher total SOM and total N compared to the banana monoculture. Similar trends were observed for soil C stocks and total C pools. The former contained 1.5 times higher soil C stocks than the latter. Likewise, the mean total C pools for the banana-coffee agroforestry farm plots were 26\% larger than that under banana monoculture. However, exchangeable K was higher in the soil of banana monocultures. Plant-available P levels were limiting under both farming systems. The study demonstrates that beyond socio-economic benefits banana-coffee agroforestry farming systems have beneficial effects on soil fertility and C sequestration compared to banana monocultures in the study area. However, precautions to avoid P depletion have to be taken under current climate conditions. Copyright Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

VL  - 26

AB  - Application of nutrients is an important way to increase crop productivity. In our study area, Tigray, development agents recommend fertilizer application to boost productivity and counteract nutrient depletion. We analysed soil fertility from different perspectives, using responses and nutrient balances on the basis of on-farm experimentation. Three perspectives, embedded in the People-Planet-Profit framework and with different temporal and spatial scales and ownership, were considered. Taking a farmer perspective, we found no significant differences in response between recommended and current farmer practices. Taking an agronomist perspective, phosphorus seemed to limit productivity. It however also became obvious that closing nutrient balances at field scale to achieve sustainability is difficult. Only by using considerable amounts of manure and at the cost of productivity this can be achieved. From a long-term environmentalist perspective, the traditional agricultural system seems sustainable in combining mixed farming and relatively low yields. We conclude that depending on the perspective taken, different interventions will be appropriate. All perspectives however indicate that gradually strengthening the existing mixed farming system by using fertilizers, organic manure and legume fallows supports crop productivity while maintaining other aspects of sustainability such as food security and profitability. In line with this, our analysis of different perspectives suggests that in our study area, farmers will only consider transitions with low risk and this specifically should be addressed in proposing pathways of transition. In processes where stakeholders with different perspectives cooperate, it is important to be aware and make use of the possibilities of comparable multi-perspective analyses.

VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Since 2008, a 5-year crop rotation experiment (winter wheat, pea, potato, barley undersown with red clover, and red clover) has been run in Tartu, Estonia, to evaluate the changes in soil chemical parameters under four fertilizer managements: (1) unfertilized conventional plots (conventional I), (2) conventional plots with addition of mineral fertilizers (conventional II), (3) organic plots with cover crops during the winter period (organic I), and (4) organic plots with the same cover crops plus a yearly amendment of 40 t haâ€“1 of cattle manure (organic II). After the first rotation, results showed significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) in soil acidity dependent on the system with mean values ranging between 5.67 (conventional II) and 6.10 (organic II). In the organic II system, manure had a significant effect on the system, increasing the organic carbon (C) content by 0.34\%, but in both organic systems, both cover crops and cattle manure were insufficient for maintaining a constant level of plant-available phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) in the soil. In the conventional II system, mineral fertilizers provided a sufficient amount of nitrogen (N) to the system and increased the concentration of P to 8.7 mg per kg. The yearly mineral or organic amendments did not counteract the significant decrease in soil-available K after the first rotation. Lastly, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) availability, strongly influenced by the soil pH local conditions, decreased with time for all systems even though organic ones presented greater concentrations of both compounds. In conclusion, the four fertilization systems managed independently would not guarantee a constant soil nutrient concentration after the first rotation. Copyright Â© Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Emerging methods for noninvasive sensing of soil moisture dynamics from field to catchment scale: a review
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial system because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this study, we review recent advances in noninvasive techniques that allow continuous noninvasive and contactless measurements of soil moisture dynamics at the field to basin scale. In particular, we report on (1) cosmic-ray neutron probes, (2) Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry, (3) ground-based microwave radiometry, (4) gamma-ray monitoring, (5) terrestrial gravimetry, and (6) low-frequency electromagnetic surface waves. Each method is described in terms of its basic principle, measurement scales, calibration issues, measurement accuracy, and applications. We hope that this review will further stimulate the community to invest in the continued development of novel soil moisture sensing methods that address the need for large-scale soil water content measurements with sufficiently high temporal resolution.

TI  - Linkage between root systems of three pioneer plant species and soil nitrogen during early reclamation of a mine site in {Lusatia}, {Germany
VL  - 23
SN  - NA
AB  - In 2005, a 7-ha artificial watershed (Chicken Creek) was built on a post mined landscape in Lusatia, Germany from sandy substrates of Pleistocene origin, commonly used in reclamation. The watershed was developed to investigate the initial phase of soil and ecosystem development under natural conditions. At this early stage, mineral nitrogen in young sandy soils is primarily limited and nitrogen fixing legumes become key components of natural succession. Local abundant pioneering legumes Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium arvense and one pioneer grass species Calamagrostis epigeios were investigated 5 years after watershed construction. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial root and nodule distribution of these species on soil nitrogen accumulation. Soil, including roots, was sampled from field monoliths covered with the aforementioned plant species. Root systems of both legumes were mainly restricted to the upper 20 cm of soil, whereas roots of C. epigeios also developed strongly at greater depths. A positive relationship was found, with higher plant densities associated with higher root densities which were associated with higher nodule densities for legumes and which were all associated with significantly higher soil nitrogen content relative to non-vegetated areas. This research provides rare information on the role root systems of pioneer legumes play in soil nitrogen input in the early stage of soil and ecosystem development during revegetation by natural succession.

TI  - Evaluating the utility of satellite soil moisture retrievals over irrigated areas and the ability of land data assimilation methods to correct for unmodeled processes
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Earth's land surface is characterized by tremendous natural heterogeneity and human-engineered modifications, both of which are challenging to represent in land surface models. Satellite remote sensing is often the most practical and effective method to observe the land surface over large geographical areas. Agricultural irrigation is an important human-induced modification to natural land surface processes, as it is pervasive across the world and because of its significant influence on the regional and global water budgets. In this article, irrigation is used as an example of a human-engineered, often unmodeled land surface process, and the utility of satellite soil moisture retrievals over irrigated areas in the continental US is examined. Such retrievals are based on passive or active microwave observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, WindSat and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The analysis suggests that the skill of these retrievals for representing irrigation effects is mixed, with ASCAT-based products somewhat more skillful than SMOS and AMSR2 products. The article then examines the suitability of typical bias correction strategies in current land data assimilation systems when unmodeled processes dominate the bias between the model and the observations. Using a suite of synthetic experiments that includes bias correction strategies such as quantile mapping and trained forward modeling, it is demonstrated that the bias correction practices lead to the exclusion of the signals from unmodeled processes, if these processes are the major source of the biases. It is further shown that new methods are needed to preserve the observational information about unmodeled processes during data assimilation. Â© Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Variation in soil fertility influences cycle dynamics and crop diversity in shifting cultivation systems
VL  - 215
SN  - NA
AB  - Smallholder farming in Amazonia is practised mostly through shifting cultivation, which under low population pressure is well adapted to the low-fertility soils that predominate in uplands and to the lack of external inputs. In this paper we investigate the effects of soil heterogeneity (in terms of fertility and texture) on shifting cultivation systems in Central Amazonia. We focus on the effect of soil variation between anthropogenic upland soils (Amazonian Dark Earths, ADE) and surrounding soils on the size and location of cultivation plots, on the cultivation cycle, and on the diversity and assemblage of crops. We found that more fertile soils are cultivated more intensively (with shorter fallow periods, higher frequency of cultivation, shorter cycles and higher labour requirements) and with different crop assemblages, and have similar or larger numbers of crop species and/or landraces. Current smallholder farming systems along soil gradients between ADE and non-anthropogenic soils show that enhanced soil fertility can favour synergies between intensification and diversification in shifting cultivation.

TI  - Particulate organic matter affects soil nitrogen mineralization under two crop rotation systems
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - Changes in the quantity and/or quality of soil labile organic matter between and after different types of cultivation system could play a dominant role in soil nitrogen (N) mineralization. The quantity and quality of particulate organic matter (POM) and potentially mineralizable-N (PMN) contents were measured in soils from 16 paired rice-rapeseed (RR)/cotton-rapeseed (CR) rotations sites in Hubei province, central China. Then four paired soils encompassing low (10th percentile), intermediate (25th and 75th percentiles), and high (90th percentile) levels of soil PMN were selected to further study the effects of POM on soil N mineralization by quantifying the net N mineralization in original soils and soils from which POM was removed. Both soil POM carbon (POM-C) and N (POM-N) contents were 45.8\% and 55.8\% higher under the RR rotation compared to the CR rotation, respectively. The PMN contents were highly correlated with the POM contents. The PMN and microbial biomass N (MBN) contents concurrently and significantly decreased when POM was removed. The reduction rate of PMN was positively correlated with changes in MBN after the removal of POM. The reduction rates of PMN and MBN after POM removal are lower under RR rotations (38.0\% and 16.3\%, respectively) than CR rotations (45.6\% and 19.5\%, respectively). Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy indicated that compounds with low-bioavailability accumulated (e.g., aromatic recalcitrant materials) in the soil POM fraction under the RR rotation but not under the CR rotation. The results of the present study demonstrated that POM plays a vital role in soil N mineralization under different rotation systems. The discrepancy between POM content and composition resulting from different crop rotation systems caused differences in N mineralization in soils. Â© Copyright 2015 Bu et al.

TI  - Soil fertility status and wheat nutrient content in {Vertisol} cropping systems of central highlands of {Ethiopia
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - Background: Land degradation reduces agricultural productivity and poses a serious threat on food security status of households. In Ethiopia, farmers have been using only urea and di-ammonium phosphate for more than 15years. Several reports that indicate lack of response to these fertilizers, which could be due to limitation of nutrients other than nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, the present study was initiated to evaluate the soil fertility status of ten sites in central highlands Vertisols of Ethiopia and wheat nutrient content. Results: The physico-chemical properties of soils showed that the soils were clayey in texture, neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.2-7.9) and low to medium in their organic matter (1.6-3.2\%) content. Total N content was low in 100\% of the samples while 80\% of the soil samples showed P deficiency ({\textless}10mgkg-1). Exchangeable K, Ca and Mg in all soil samples were high, while available sulfur was low. On the other hand, K to Mg ratio varied from 0.13:1 to 0.44:1, indicating Mg induced K deficiency. All soil samples were adequate when analyzed by ammonium bicarbonate di-ethylene tri-amine penta-acetic acid extractable Cu ({\textgreater}0.5mgkg-1), Fe ({\textgreater}5mgkg-1), and Mn ({\textgreater}1mgkg-1) contents. However, 70\% of the samples were deficient in Zn ({\textless}1.5mgkg-1) content. Mehlich 3 extractable B ({\textless}0.5mgkg-1) and acid ammonium oxalate extractable Mo ({\textless}0.1mgkg-1) were found to be low in all soil samples. The plant analysis data showed that all samples were low in N, P and K, while high in Ca and Mg concentrations. The deficiency of tissue K content was not predicted by the soil exchangeable K test. Plant micronutrient analysis showed that Cu, Fe, Mn and Cl concentrations were within the sufficiency range while Zn was deficient in all of the samples. Conclusions: Soil and/or tissue test results are indicative of deficiency of N, P, K, S, Zn, B and Mo that could be amended by fertilizer application, although more data are needed to thoroughly support this conclusion. The highest correlation (r{\textgreater}0.90) between soil and plant nutrient content was observed for P, K, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, implying that flag leaves at flowering stage can be used to calibrate soil and plant contents for the deficient nutrients.

TI  - RF} spectroscopy technique for soil nutrient analysis
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The manuscript describes RF Spectroscopy approach to determine the nutrients in the soil. Two different soil nutrients namely urea and potash are considered in this study. In order to obtain the frequency spectra of each of the soil nutrient a cell is designed, which is well shielded from external electromagnetic interferences and has a capability of giving a steady response for a given soil nutrient. The RF responses of each of the nutrients with different concentrations in the range of 10MHz-4.4GHz are obtained using a signal generator and a spectrum analyzer. The results obtained show that at specific frequencies, the RF response of the soil nutrient under study changes in accordance with the changes in the concentration of the soil component and at other frequencies, it shows a flat response. Since the response varies in accordance with the concentration, these results can be used for the prediction of an unknown concentration of a nutrient using a multivariate analysis technique based on the PLSR model, where different concentrations of the nutrients are used as variables.

TI  - A data-driven method to remove temperature effects in tdr-measured soil water content at a mongolian site
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - As a convenient, easy-to-use tool, time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is becoming extensively used to measure soil water content. Used not only in hydrological applications, the measurements are also used as ground truth for satellite remote sensing of soil moisture. However, TDR measurements usually include diurnal fluctuation caused by diurnal change of temperature. Though this is an old problem, there is not a general solution. The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm to remove temperature effects of TDR measurements by analyzing its relationship with meteorological variables. From data observed at a Mongolian site, it is found that impact of soil temperature on soil water content is nearly proportional to soil temperature itself and soil water content. An algorithm is developed and applied to the Mongolian data set. The temperature effects can be effectively removed under dry and wet conditions.

TI  - An assessment of remotely sensed surface and root zone soil moisture through active and passive sensors in northeast {Asia
VL  - 160
SN  - NA
AB  - Active and passive microwave remote sensing techniques provide an effective way to observe soil moisture contents. We validated Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor products using estimations from nine different stations located in the Korean peninsula, in northeast Asia from May 1 to September 30, 2010. The results of the surface soil moisture (SSM) products showed a reasonable agreement with the average correlation coefficient (R) values of 0.39, 0.42, and 0.53 for the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - National Aeronautics and Space Administration (VUA-NASA) AMSR-E, and ASCAT SSM datasets, respectively. The root zone soil moisture (RZSM) products, derived using the NSIDC soil water index (SWI), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) AMSR-E, and the ASCAT SWI datasets showed relatively high R values of 0.47, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively, with in situ soil moisture at a depth of 20cm. In particular, AMSR-E USDA RZSM data show best agreements with in-situ data at 20cm, among the four depths (10, 20, 30, and 50cm). In this study, the ASCAT SSM and SWI were rescaled based on the porosity and the effective saturation according to soil texture. Renormalized soil moisture products using three renormalization methods: the linear regression correction (REG), average-standard deviation (Î¼-Ïƒ), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) provided an improvement in biases and RMSEs, with SSM (SWI) RMSEs of 0.04 (0.02), 0.05 (0.03), and 0.05 (0.03)m3/m3 for REG, Î¼-Ïƒ, and CDF matching, respectively. A Taylor diagram was used to assess the accuracy of four satellite soil moisture products with in situ data on a plot. Based on these results, ASCAT soil moisture products were potentially proven to be more appropriate than AMSR-E products in northeast Asia. Remotely sensed soil moisture datasets from passive (AMSR-E) and active (ASCAT) sensors are beneficial to operational hydrological investigations and water management activities.

TI  - Geostatistical approach for management of soil nutrients with special emphasis on different forms of potassium considering their spatial variation in intensive cropping system of {West} {Bengal}, {India
VL  - 187
SN  - NA
AB  - A large part of precision agriculture research in the developing countries is devoted towards precision nutrient management aspects. This has led to better economics and efficiency of nutrient use with off-farm advantages of environmental security. The keystone of precision nutrient management is analysis and interpretation of spatial variability of soils by establishing management zones. In this study, spatial variability of major soil nutrient contents was evaluated in the Ghoragacha village of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India. Surface soil samples from 100 locations, covering different cropping systems of the village, was collected from 0 to 15 cm depth using 100 Ã— 100 m grid system and analyzed in the laboratory to determine organic carbon (OC), available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents of the soil as well as its water-soluble K (KWS), exchangeable K (KEX),and non-exchangeable forms of K (KNEX). Geostatistical analyses were performed to determine the spatial variation structure of each nutrient content within the village, followed by the generation of surface maps through kriging. Four commonly used semivariogram models, i.e., spherical, exponential, Gaussian, and linear models were fitted to each soil property, and the best one was used to prepare surface maps through krigging. Spherical model was found the best for available N and P contents, while linear and exponential model was the best for OC and available K, and for KWS and KNEK, Gausian model was the best. Surface maps of nutrient contents showed that N content (129â€“195 kg haâˆ’1) was the most limiting factor throughout the village, while P status was generally very high (10â€“678 kg haâˆ’1) in the soils of the present village. Among the different soil K fractions, KWS registered the maximum variability (CV 75 \%), while the remaining soil K fractions showed moderate to high variation. Interestingly, KNEX content also showed high variability, which essentially indicates reserve native K exploitation under intensive cultivation. These maps highlight the necessity of estimating the other soil K fractions as well for better understanding of soil K supplying capacity and K fertilization strategy rather than the current recommendations, based on the plant-available K alone. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the variability of nutrient distribution was a consequence of complex interactions between the cropping system, nutrient application rates, and the native soil characteristics, and such interactions could be utilized to develop the nutrient management strategies for intensive small-holder system.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the critical parameters to be considered in civil, geological and agricultural works. Unfortunately, the challenging issue is found on a suitable model in determining the soil moisture accurately. In this article, the concept and development of soil moisture measurements via ground penetrating radar (GPR) principle is presented. This work is implemented is simulation and lab measurement. The result of the research is promising with high percentage of agreement with Topp theoretical value. The values are 31\% to 61\% for sand, 5\% to 42\% for clay, and 44\% to 54\% for loamy. In order to validate the proposed system, a new type of soil have been prepared and used for measurement, and the result has an accuracy of 93\%. By using the proposed developed models, soil moisture estimation can be easily determined with minimal data input in real time through a novelty GPR soil moisture method. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Alpine algorithms-time series of innovative remote sensing products for {Alpine} areas: {Snow} cover leaf area index and soil moisture
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The derivation of bio-physical parameter time series from remote sensing data is of high importance for the monitoring and understanding of mountain ecosystems. However, their retrieval in mountain environments represents a challenging task due to the heterogeneous landscape and the topography. Already available global products may therefore present limitations in mountain areas. In this paper, innovative approaches for the derivation of snow cover, leaf area index (LAI), and soil moisture over the Alps are described, taking into account the peculiarity of the mountain areas. In order to account for the high heterogeneity, snow and leaf area index products rely on the use of 250 m spatial resolution MODIS data, in conjunction with elevation data and, in the case of soil moisture, radar data. Further, the correction of the topography on the remote sensing signal in implemented in all algorithms. Special conditions of mountain vegetation, such as snow in forests or the biophysical conditions of mountain grasslands, are also accounted for. The time series are used in conjunction in order to better understand key processes such as water and carbon cycles or vegetation phenology. Â© 2015 IEEE.

TI  - On-farm participatory evaluation of technologies for soil fertility management in the sahel, west africa
VL  - 9
SN  - NA
AB  - We conducted on-farm participatory experiments over three years at six villages in the Fakara commune of Western Niger to demonstrate, verify, and evaluate the relevance of soil fertility management methods based on millet/cowpea intercropping. We tested six methods using one of three organic fertilizers (millet husks, manure, or neither) with or without mineral fertilizer and one using millet/hibiscus intercropping with millet husks. We evaluated farmersâ€™ preferences by measuring the self-selected proportions of plots that farmers used for each condition. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of millet/cowpea intercropping; the application of mineral fertilizer, manure, and millet husks; and alternating-year applicationâ€”all of them are affordable for farmers in the Sahel. Both the demonstration and farmerdirected trials made farmers aware of the effects of these methods. Farmersâ€™ selection of methods depended on availability. The dissemination of agricultural methods mainly depends on the availability of input materials in the absence of other constraints such as money and accessibility.

TI  - Salinity and soil moisture retrieval algorithms in western {Jilin} {Province} of {China} using passive microwave remote sensing data
VL  - 9610
SN  - NA
AB  - Researches on soil moisture and salinity are mainly concerned in the observation of soil salinization. Passive microwave remote sensing data can reflect the dielectric properties of different land surfaces. Meanwhile, soil dielectric properties have high sensitivity to changes of soil moisture and salinity. As a result, passive microwave remote sensing data can be used for retrieval of surface soil moisture and salinity. Western Jilin Province of China was selected as the study area in this paper. By the iteration between the rough surface reflectivity calculated based on satellite data and the rough surface reflectivity calculated based on land surface model, three parameters, including surface roughness parameter, soil moisture and salinity can be retrieved simultaneously. After comparing the retrieval results to the field measurement of salinity and FY satellite soil moisture product, the experimental results show that the surface roughness parameters of the study area were concentrated in the vicinity of 0.31. The error between the average of retrieved salinity and the average of the field measurement of salinity was about 10.52g/kg. The error between the average of retrieved soil moisture and the average of FY satellite soil moisture product was approximately 0.005cm3/cm3. Â© 2015 SPIE.

VL  - 9637
SN  - NA
AB  - Due to the lack of observation data which match the pixels size of satellite remote sensing data, the inversion accuracy of satellite inversion products in Tibet plateau is lack of an effective verification. Hence, the in situ observations are required to support their calibration and validation. For this purpose, a multi-level and multi-scale soil moisture and temperature regular automatic monitoring network (MS-SMTRMN) was established on Qiangtang grassland of northern Tibet area to support multiple satellite remote sensing application, climate modeling or assimilation, and land surface process studies. In this paper, MS-SMTRMN aim at multi-satellite remote sensing application was detailed and the observation data with quality control were used to the verification for multiple satellite retrieval products (FY3, AMSR2 and SMOS). This study will contribute to the understanding of the quality of products and lays the foundation for the satellite data assimilation results in the TP area. Â© 2015 SPIE.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - This study evaluated four sensor technologies (near-infrared (NIR), Raman spectroscopy, electro-chemical, and colorimetry) to determine a feasible approach for an in-field soil phosphorus (available P) measurement system. The dataset consisted of 12 North American Proficiency Testing Program (NAPT) soils and 12 wet Kansas soils (P range of 5 to 156.0 mg kg-1). An NIR spectrometer showed an R2 â‰¥ 0.43 and a ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of 1.372, which did not reach the goal (RPD = 2 and R2 â‰¥ 0.70). For a Raman spectrometer, a partial least squares (PLS) regression and a simple linear regression method of calibration were tested; however, both methods showed poor results (RPD = 1.21 and R2 = 0.27 or lower). Customized cobalt ion-selective electrodes were tested in Mehlich 3 extraction solutions and resulted in poor results (R2 = 0.44 and RPD = 1.33) for NAPT soils. A rapid colorimetric method was developed consisting of a shortened extraction (1 min), rapid filtration (syringe filter), and rapid color development (1 min with stirring at 50Â°C), which had an excellent R2 of 0.98 for each change independently. The rapid colorimetric method was compared to the standard colorimetric analysis. This test resulted in an R2 of 0.85 and an RPD of 1.94 for all NAPT samples, and soils with P {\textless} 80 mg kg-1 had an R2 of 0.95 and an RPD of 4.74. For field soils, the R2 was 0.85 and the RPD was 1.91 for all ranges, and an R2 of 0.83 and an RPD of 2.12 was found for soils with P {\textless} 80 mg kg-1. Considering that it is not necessary to measure soil P contents precisely in areas where fertilizer does not need to be applied, this rapid colorimetric method would be used for in-field soil P measurement systems.

VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - Nitrate-N (NO3-N) leaching in intensive crop production systems is an important issue due to its potential as a pollutant and a valuable resource. This study aimed at evaluating NO3-N leaching using on-farm measurements and modeling of 12 commercial fields of leafy vegetables characterized by an array of farm management. Real-time monitoring of the soil moisture, temperature and bulk electrical conductivity using a capacitance/resistance sensor was carried out to verify the temperature index and the leaching constant integrated in the soil nitrogen balance estimation system. Results showed that measured soil temperature strongly correlated to model estimates. Values of the leaching constant were 0.0006 kg kg-1 and 0.00075 kg kg-1 (in 2013) both of which were close to the model value of 0.0007 kg kg-1. Values in 2012 were either too high (0.00127 kg kg-1) or too low (0.0010 kg kg-1). NO3-N leaching ranged from 13.50 kg ha-1 to 72.71 kg ha-1 in 2012 and 8.66 kg ha-1 to 41.10 kg ha-1 or 0.00 kg ha-1to 41.10 with or without rye, respectively. NO3-N leaching in single cropping systems of 2012 was higher than in double cropping systems of 2013.

TI  - Merging two passive microwave remote sensing ({SMOS} and {AMSR}\_E) datasets to produce a long term record of {Soil} {Moisture
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - This study investigated the use of physically based statistical regressions to retrieve a global and long term (e.g. 2003â€“2014) surface soil moisture (SSM) record based on a combination of passive microwave remote sensing observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E; 2003-Sept. 2011) and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS; 2010â€“2014) sensors. Statistical regression methods based on bi-polarization (horizontal and vertical) brightness temperatures (Tb) observations obtained from AMSR-E. The coefficients of these regression equations were calibrated using SMOS level 3 SSM maps (SMOSL3) as a reference. This calibration process was carried out over the June 2010-Sept. 2011 period, over which both SMOS and AMSR-E observations coincide. Based on these calibrated coefficients global SSM maps could be computed from the AMSR-E Tb observations over the whole 2003â€“2011 period. In this study, the SSM maps were successfully evaluated against the SMOSL3 SSM products over the period of calibration (Jun. 2010-Sept. 2011). Correlations (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were computed between the AMSR-E retrievals and the reference (SMOSL3) SSM products. The R (mostly {\textgreater} 0.75) and RMSE (mostly {\textless} 0.04 m3/m3) maps showed a good agreement between the retrieved and SMOSL3 SSM products particularly over Australia, central USA, central Asia, and the Sahel. In conclusion, the statistical regression method is capable of retrieving a coherent "SMOS-AMSR-E" SSM time series for the period 2003â€“2014.

TI  - Comparison of the gravimetric sampling and impedance methods for measuring soil moisture content
VL  - 62
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper was focused on determining whether gravimetric sampling and impedance method of measuring soil moisture content provided different results and if they did, what was the size of the differences between particular methods on rendzinas and cambisols. The means of moisture content should be equal when using both methods on similar spots. During the research, an Eijkelkamp Penetrologger penetrometer equipped with impedance probes and gravimetric sampling cylinders from Eijkelkamp were used. The samples were taken from the undisturbed stand, ruts, and the centre of the skid trail. The impedance probes were inserted six centimetres deep into the soil. Soil samples were taken from similar depth in order to calculate the moisture content through the gravimetric method. 138 measurements were carried out for each method. The minimal difference of moisture contents measured by individual methods was 0.01\%, maximal difference was 22.06\%, and on average it was 7.42\%. Oneway ANOVA was used for first stage analysis of the statistical sample. It proved that the differences between measurements were statistically significant in two out of three considered stands. Tukeyâ€™s HSD test was used to identify which data groups contributed to refuting the aforementioned hypothesis. The test showed that in one stand all relevant pairs of data were significantly different, while in the other stand only data pairs from the ruts were significantly different. The calibration method provided by the producers did not refine the accuracy of the impedance probes sufficiently and different calibration procedures have to be used.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of the NASA Soil Moisture Active \& Passive (SMAP) mission is to provide global measurements of soil moisture and its freeze/thaw state. The SMAP measurement approach is to integrate L-band radar and radiometer as a single observation system combining the respective strengths of active and passive remote sensing for enhanced soil moisture mapping. Airborne instruments will be a key part of the SMAP validation program. Here, we present an airborne campaign in the Rur catchment, Germany, in which the passive L-band system Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR2) and the active L-band system DLR F-SAR were flown on six dates in 2013. The flights covered the full heterogeneity of the area under investigation, i.e. all types of land cover and experimental monitoring sites. The obtained data sets are used as a test-bed for the analysis of existing and development of new active-passive fusion techniques. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring soil moisture through assimilation of active microwave remote sensing observation into a hydrologic model
VL  - 9669
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture can be estimated from point measurements, hydrologic models, and remote sensing. Many researches indicated that the most promising approach for soil moisture is the integration of remote sensing surface soil moisture data and computational modeling. Although many researches were conducted using passive microwave remote sensing data in soil moisture assimilation with coarse spatial resolution, few researches were carried out using active microwave remote sensing observation. This research developed and tested an operational approach of assimilation for soil moisture prediction using active microwave remote sensing data ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) in Heihe Watershed. The assimilation was based on ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a forward radiative transfer model and the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The forward radiative transfer model, as a semi-empirical backscattering model, was used to eliminate the effect of surface roughness and vegetation cover on the backscatter coefficient. The impact of topography on soil water movement and the vertical and lateral exchange of soil water were considered. We conducted experiments to assimilate active microwave remote sensing data (ASAR) observation into a hydrologic model at two field sites, which had different underlying conditions. The soil moisture ground-truth data were collected through the field Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) tools, and were used to assess the assimilation method. The temporal evolution of soil moisture measured at point-based monitoring locations were compared with EnKF based model predictions. The results indicated that the estimate of soil moisture was improved through assimilation with ASAR observation and the soil moisture based on data assimilation can be monitored in moderate spatial resolution.

TI  - On the use of repeated {EMI} measurements for mapping soil moisture and implications for soil mapping
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Electromagnetic induction (EMI) methods are widely used for mapping soil properties at the field scale, including soil moisture (Î¸), with benefits for precision agriculture. Recent studies showed ambiguous results on the influence of Î¸ on the measured bulk electrical conductivity (ECa). At the SchÃ¤fertal hillslope site (Germany), spatial distribution of soil properties as well as the spatial and temporal dynamics of Î¸ patterns were studied in detail within an intensive hydrological monitoring. At the same time, repeated EMI surveys were conducted. with the aim to asses the suitability of repeated EMI surveys for mapping Î¸, and to investigate the limitations of its applicability for soil mapping. Results suggest that i) stable soil properties have the major effect on the EMI signal, while Î¸ plays a minor role; ii) soil moisture may strenghten the ECa pattern when local soil properties control the Î¸ pattern; iii) when the contribution of other factors is considerable, ECa patterns related to stable soil properties may be partially hidden. In conclusion, EMI measurements carried out under unsuitable hydrological conditions may lead to misinterpretation of soil properties, therefore combined pedological and hydrological expertise is necessary to support proximal soil sensing campaigns, with benefits for precision agriculture practices.

TI  - Joint use of soil moisture and vegetation growth condition by remote sensing on the agricultural drought monitoring
VL  - 9815
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing is one of important methods on the agricultural drought monitoring for its long-term and wide-area observations. The detection of soil moisture and vegetation growth condition are two widely used remote sensing methods on that. However, because of the time lag in the impact of water deficit on the crop growth, it is difficulty to indicate the severity of drought by once monitoring. It also cannot distinguish other negative impact on crop growth such as low temperature or solar radiation. In this paper, the joint use of soil moisture and vegetation growth condition detections was applied on the drought management during the summer of 2013 in Liaoning province, China, in which 84 counties were affected by agricultural drought. MODIS vegetation indices and land surface temperature (LST) were used to extract the drought index. Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which only contain the change in vegetation index, and Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI), which combined the information of vegetation index and land surface temperature, were selected to compare the monitoring ability on drought during the drought period in Liaoning, China in 2014. It was found that VCI could be a good method on the loss assessment. VSWI has the information on the change in LST, which can indicate the spatial pattern of drought and can also be used as the early warning method in the study. Â© 2015 SPIE.

TI  - An automated system for monitoring soil moisture and controlling irrigation using low-cost open-source microcontrollers
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - Substrate volumetric water content (VWC) is a useful measurement for automated irrigation systems. We have previously developed automated irrigation controllers that use capacitance sensors and dataloggers to supply plants with ondemand irrigation. However, the dataloggers and accompanying software used to build and program those controllers make these systems expensive. Relatively new, low-cost open-source microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensorbased irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications. We designed and built an automated irrigation system using a microcontroller, capacitance soil moisture sensors, and solenoid valves. This system effectively monitored and controlled VWC over a range of irrigation thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m3.mL3) with â€˜Panama Redâ€™ hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella) in a peat:perlite substrate. The microcontroller can be used with both regular 24-V alternating current (AC) solenoid valves and with latching 6- to 18-V direct current (DC) solenoid valves. The technology is relatively inexpensive (microcontroller and accessories cost 107, four capacitance soil moisture sensors cost 440, and four solenoid valves cost 120, totaling 667) and accessible. The irrigation controller required little maintenance over the course of a 41-day trial. The low cost of this irrigation controller makes it useful in many horticultural settings, including both research and production Â© 2015, Hort Technology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling of soil nutrient balances, flows and stocks revealed effects of management on soil fertility in south {Ecuadorian} smallholder farming systems
VL  - 101
SN  - NA
AB  - Linking nutrient balances and flows to soil nutrient stocks creates a valuable indicator for sustainability assessment in agricultural land-use systems. Therefore, we investigated the impact of management on soil fertility at farm/field scale using the Nutmon approach. A detailed methodology for the adaptation of the difficult-to-quantify flows to the local conditions is described. Research was carried out in the three farming systems of Yantzaza (low-external-input), El Tambo (irrigated cash crops) and San Lucas (integrated nutrient management) in southern Ecuador. For each land-use within a farm (annual and perennial crops, pasture, forest), soil nutrient balances and flows were modeled with Nutmon and soil nutrient stocks were calculated for NPK. Soil nutrient balances were evaluated using potential socio-economic and soil fertility explanatory variables. Balances for the different land-uses in the three research areas varied between âˆ’151 to 66 kg haâˆ’1 aâˆ’1 for N, âˆ’4 to 33 kg haâˆ’1 aâˆ’1 for P and âˆ’346 to 39 kg haâˆ’1 aâˆ’1 for K and were mainly negative. Up to 70 \% of the balancesâ€™ variability was explained by soil fertility variables and financial flows. Highest external inputs existed in land-uses with a strong market orientation. Land-uses benefiting from a surplus of within-farm flows had the highest soil nutrient stocks. The focus on N fertilization induced highly negative PK balances in annual crops of El Tambo. In contrast, the application of organic fertilizers and nutrient recycling in San Lucas resulted in positive NP balances particularly for perennial crops. NP balances in annual crops of Yantzaza were most negative due to nonexistent fertilization, leaching and burning of crop residues. A non-sustainable land-use of annual crops in Yantzaza was illustrated by total N stock decreases of 4.9 \% aâˆ’1 and decreased soil organic carbon stocks to 85 \% of adjacent forest sites. Results indicated a potential risk regarding sustainable management of soils in the research area and provide a basis for policy and decision makers to develop appropriate management strategies.

TI  - Multitemporal soil moisture retrieval from 3-days {ERS}-2 data: {Comparison} with {ASCAT}, {SMOS} and in situ measurements
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of soil moisture maps derived from satellite remote sensing measurements in operational applications (e.g. hydrology) was generally limited to instruments providing low resolution data (scatterometers, microwave radiometers) so far, because only these instruments offered a suitable temporal resolution. However, with the launch, in 2014, of a new generation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems working at L- and C-bands (i.e., SMAP, Sentinel-1), it is expected the availability of soil moisture maps characterized by high spatial resolution and short revisit time. This kind of data give also the opportunity to improve the quality of SAR-derived soil moisture maps by applying multitemporal inversion techniques that, using a time series of SAR data, allows for dealing with the well-known ill-posedness of the retrieval problem. In anticipation of the availability of Sentinel-1 images, this study uses a dataset of ERS-2 SAR data with a revisit time of only three days to test a multitemporal soil moisture retrieval algorithm, already designed within the framework of project funded by European Space Agency, when vegetation is well-developed. As validation data, the in situ measurements of a set of stations belonging to the International Soil Moisture Network are used. To provide further insights on soil moisture retrieval from satellite microwave data, SAR retrievals and stations measurements are also compared with the estimates provided by ASCAT and SMOS.

TI  - A remote sensing technique to determine the soil moisture saturation index
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture saturation index (SMSI) is an important indicator that demonstrates the status of the soil water content for drought monitoring. However, at present, most of the methods to calculate the SMSI from the in situ measurement data are inadequate or inaccurate. This paper proposed a simple method to determine the SMSI from the remotely sensed data. Combining the theory of thermal inertia and triangle method, the apparent thermal inertia and fractional vegetation cover can construct a triangular space. In this space, SMSI can be determined easily. Validation was performed with in situ measurements for 19 meteorological stations in the study area. Results indicated that the method can obtain the accurate soil water status that reflects the variation in soil moisture to some extent and is suitable for monitoring the regional surface soil moisture.

TI  - Rough surface effects on active and passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture at {L}-band using {3D} fast solution of {Maxwell}'s equations
VL  - 9260
SN  - NA
AB  - The forthcoming Water Cycle Observation Mission (WCOM) is to understand the water cycle system among land, atmosphere, and ocean. In both active and passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture, the surface roughness plays an important role. Electromagnetic models of roughness provide tables of emissivities and backscattering coefficients that can be used to retrieve soil moisture. In this paper, a fast and accurate three dimensional solution of Maxwell's equations is developed and employed to solve rough soil surface scattering problem at L-band. The algorithm combines QR Pre-Ranked Multilevel UV(MLUV) factorization and Hierarchical Fast Far Field Approximation. It is implemented using OpenMP interface for fast parallel calculation. In this algorithm, 1) QR based rank predetermined algorithm is derived to further compress the UV matrix pairs obtained using coarse-coarse sampling; 2) at the finer levels, MLUV is used straightforwardly to factorize the interactions between groups, while at the coarsest level, interactions between groups in the interaction list are calculated using an elegantly derived Hierarchical Fast Far Field Approximation (HFAFFA) to accelerate the calculation of interactions between large groups while keeping the accuracy of this approximation; 3) OpenMP interface is used to parallelize this new algorithm. Numerical results including the incoherent bistatic scattering coefficients and the emissivity demonstrate the efficiency of this method. Â© 2014 SPIE.

TI  - Geostatistical mapping of soil fertility constraints for yam based cropping systems of {North}-central and {Southeast} {Nigeria
VL  - 2-3
SN  - NA
AB  - An extensive survey covering the area of 92,764 km2 was conducted in the fields of over 385 yam grower farmers under yam based cropping system of the North-central and Southeast Nigeria. Using geo-statistical mapping tools, we aimed to quantify the degree of spatial variability of selected soil fertility parameters under yam based copping system and to pave the way to develop an appropriate recommendation for a profitable fertilizers management for the small farmer of the region. Spatial analysis of the data showed that the best fit semi-variogram models for nutrients N and K were rational quadratic and hole effect for available P. Relative nugget effect (RNE) and nugget-to-sill ratio (Co/Co + C) of the total N concentration in soil were 70\% and 45\%, respectively for exchangeable K. The available P in soil (Bray-P) showed a weak spatial dependence with RNE of 83\% and a range of 1.8 km. The moderate spatial dependence observed for N and exchange K recommends for developing a strategy for site-specific management of N and K nutrients taking into account the structural and random factors dominant in the study areas. The management of P nutrient to improve yam production in north-south and southeast of Nigeria is generalized at regional scale, given the weak spatial dependence observed for this nutrient.

TI  - Combining cosmic-ray neutron and capacitance sensors and fuzzy inference to spatially quantify soil moisture distribution
VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper combines data from soil moisture capacitance probes and a cosmic-ray neutron probe in a fuzzy inference system to estimate spatially variable soil moisture in a (âˆ¼ 28) ha circular area at an hourly interval in northeast Tasmania, Australia. The technique uses hourly counts of cosmic-ray neutrons, a network of 25 capacitance probes measuring soil moisture at half hourly intervals and at five depths (0-50 cm), and a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. We quantified soil moisture in the top portion of the soil during wet and dry periods for training and testing periods. After training, the technique provided reliable estimates of temporal pattern of soil moisture at 10- and 20-cm depths during a wet period using input data only from the cosmic-ray neutron probe. There was over-prediction of soil moisture during a dry period, which suggests a longer training period representative of the full range of likely conditions might be required. Spatial maps of soil water content produced from the single cosmic-ray neutron probe were similar to those of the capacitance probe. Â© 2014 IEEE.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - A permanent plot experiment was being conducted since 1988 on Inceptisols of College of Agriculture, Rajendranagar to study the long term effects of chemical fertilizers alone and in combination with organic sources on the sustainability and soil fertility under rice-rice cropping system. The study was made with 12 treatments in which major nutrients were supplied either through fertilizers alone or in conjunction with FYM, paddy straw or gliricidia at 50\% and 25\% substitution level of nitrogen during kharif and with fertilizers alone to supply 75 and 100\% recommended dose of fertilizer during rabi. The system productivity of rice averaged over 24 years was highest in plots which received 50\% N through gliricidia+50\% RDF in kharif and 100\% RDF in rabi seasons. However, the sustainability yield index of rice-rice system was highest (0.67) when all the nutrients were applied through fertilizers during both the seasons, and also when 25\% N was substituted through gliricidia during kharif and 25\% NPK was saved during rabi season. However, improvement in soil organic carbon content was more prominent when 25\% or 50\% of N was substituted through paddy straw and FYM during kharif season With all the nutrient management practices, available nitrogen in the soil was maintained, there was a build-up of available phosphorus, while available potassium was depleted considerably.

AB  - Passive microwave remote sensing is one of the most effective methods for inversing soil moisture. Under the condition of laboratory, firstly, C band microwave radiation was used to achieve the trial of ground-based remote sensing soil moisture, and then regression analysis was carried out according to the data measured, finally, got the C band experience regression model of soil moisture inversion. The results showed that: in the level-off state of soil surface, soil humidity and soil microwave emission rate is linear negative correlation, in the other words, soil microwave emission rate decreased while the soil moisture increased. Besides, with the increasing of soil surface roughness, both the value of microwave polarization index (MPDI) and microwave emission rate polarization difference Î”e have the same trend of quick drop, stabilization and slow raise, and it presented the relationship of quadratic curve with the change of roughness.

In this research, a remote sensing inversion model of soil nitrogen storage were built with an index of Rain-Use Efficiency (NDVImax/Ln(RainMarch-July)) through analyzing the influence of precipitation and soil nitrogen storage of steppe ecosystem on aboveground biomass and making use of the MODIS-NDVI with resolution of 1000 m and the spatial interpolation of rainfall from March to July recorded by 47 weather stations in Inner Mongolia. With this model, we monitored the soil nitrogen storage of the typical steppe in Inner Mongolia in the period from 2010 to 2012. Comparison shows that the soil nitrogen storage obtained from remote sensing monitoring accords with field measured value well. The difference between remote sensing monitoring result and measured value is probably related with the spatial resolution of remote sensing images and the number of sampling points, so the error of remote sensing monitoring can be further reduced by increasing the spatial resolution of remote sensing images or increasing the number of sampling points in verification pixels.

TI  - A new method to inverse soil moisture based on thermal infrared and passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - 9260
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the main factors in the water, energy and carbon cycles. It constitutes a major uncertainty in climate and hydrological models. By now, passive microwave remote sensing and thermal infrared remote sensing technology have been used to obtain and monitor soil moisture. However, as the resolution of passive microwave remote sensing is very low and the thermal infrared remote sensing method fails to provide soil temperature on cloudy days, it is hard to monitor the soil moisture accurately. To solve the problem, a new method has been tried in this research. Thermal infrared remote sensing and passive microwave remote sensing technology have been combined based on the delicate experiment. Since the soil moisture retrieved by passive microwave in general represents surface centimeters deep, which is different from deeper soil moisture estimated by thermal inertia method, a relationship between the two depths soil moisture has been established based on the experiment. The results show that there is a good relationship between the soil moisture estimated by passive microwave and thermal infrared remote sensing method. The correlation coefficient is 0.78 and RMSE (root mean square error) is 0.0195cm3Â· cm-3. This research provides a new possible method to inverse soil moisture. Â© 2014 SPIE.

TI  - The capacitive soil moisture sensor research
VL  - 584-586
SN  - NA
AB  - To meet the requirements of a large-scale soil moisture monitoring system, this dissertation developed a new type of capacitive soil moisture sensor based on the detection and amplification of the singal peak-to-peak value named PA-1 sensor. PA-1 sensor was calibrated and evaluated under static laboratory conditions. A new type of soil moisture sensor named PA-1 is developed, which is based on the relationship between soil moisture and soil relative permittivity. Circuit design, operating features and exterior design of the sensor are introduced. PA-1 is calibrated in solution samples using the standard calibration method. Calibration experiment results show that PA-1 has a very linear measurement curve. The performance of PA-1 is studied and compared to the widely used Decagon Company's EC-5 capacitive soil moisture sensor. Experiment results show that PA-1 has advantages of high sensitivity, low temperature drift, strong tolerance to electromagnetic interference and low power consumption.

TI  - Soil moisture content inversion research using multi-source remote sensing data
VL  - 9260
SN  - NA
AB  - The method of apparent thermal inertia and the method of vegetation water supply index were used respectively for inversion of soil moisture content on the whole study area using the MODIS remote sensing data. The threshold value of NDVI that divided coverage of vegetation into high and low classification was determined as 0.3 after the correlative analysis between the result of the apparent thermal inertia model, the vegetation water supply index and the vegetation index of NDVI. Land use classification was worked out using the TM remote sensing data by ENVI software before the coverage of vegetation was divided into high and low classification. According to the result of land use classification, the VSWI method was used to retrieval soil moisture in the high vegetation coverage area using daily MODIS L1B data and the apparent thermal inertia model was used in low vegetation coverage using MODIS composite products data. The inversion results of two vegetation coverage types are integrated into a raster image after data normalization processing. Combining with the measured data, the precision of the result shows that the RMSE of this method is 8.3\% and the MRE is 9.19\% .Results show that the inversion accuracy is improved highly on the whole by the method adopted in this research.

TI  - A method for ground soil moisture inversion based on integration of active and passive remote sensing data
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - A soil moisture inversion method of collaborative active and passive remote sensing based on genetic neural network algorithm was proposed. First it created a BP neural network and optimized node weights of BP network by genetic algorithm. Then TM data (TM3, TM4 and TM6) and different ASAR data of polarization and polarization ratio (VV, VH and VH/VV) were used as inputs of neural network, the outputs were ground soil moisture and part of measured data were used to train network and inverse to get soil moisture distribution. Finally it verified the effectiveness of genetic neural network optimization algorithm and the inversion results based on integration of active and passive remote sensing. The results showed that: it was efficient and effective of the new optimization algorithm and the inversion results based on integration of TM and ASAR data was obviously better than inversion individual that embodied advantages and potential of soil moisture inversion based on integration of active and passive remote sensing.

TI  - Soil fertility, physical and chemical organic matter fractions, natural {13C} and {15N} abundance in biogenic and physicogenic aggregates in areas under different land use systems
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - The dynamics of soil aggregation, including aggregate formation by biogenic and physicogenic processes, is affected by the soil management system. The present study aimed to divide soil aggregates into biogenic and physicogenic, and to characterise the aggregates in terms of soil exchange complex, distribution of total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (N) levels, and natural 13C and 15N abundance, and determine C levels in the soil organic matter (SOM) fractions of the aggregates. The areas studied were under a no-till system (NTS) established 15 years before, conventional tillage system (CTS) managed with ploughing and harrowing for 56 years, and a secondary forest (Forest) and pasture grass (Axonopus compressus) (Pasture) (both â‰¥30 years old). Undisturbed soil samples were collected at 0-5 and 5-10cm. CTS was unsuitable for biogenic aggregate formation, and NTS and Forest areas showed similar biogenic and physicogenic aggregate content. The Pasture area promoted the formation of biogenic aggregates. In contrast to CTS, NTS increased TOC, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Considering the parameters evaluated, the Forest area showed the most variation (differences) between biogenic and physicogenic aggregates. Biogenic aggregates exhibited higher TOC and nutrient levels than their physicogenic counterparts. In the CTS area, the absence of legumes and the long-term and constant use of N-fertilisers resulted in 15N soil enrichment (at 0-5cm). In the Pasture area, the absence of legumes and the constant deposition of cattle manure also increased 15N content relative to NTS and Forest areas. The Forest area had the lowest 15N values in the two layers and aggregate types studied. The levels of 13C reflect the type of material incorporated in the soil (mostly C3 plants in Forest and NTS areas and C4 plants in Pasture and CTS areas). The Pasture area favoured the formation of stable SOM, with higher levels of C content in humin fraction (C-HUM) and mineral-associated OC (MOC). CTS compromised SOM stabilisation, producing lower levels of C-HUM, MOC, and moderately oxidisable and resistant fractions. The biogenic aggregates enhanced soil fertility and contained higher C content in SOM fractions than the physicogenic aggregates. We conclude that biogenic rather than physicogenic aggregates can be considered reliable indicators of soil quality. Â© CSIRO 2014.

AB  - Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) is often used as a test bed for innovative modeling and assimilation capabilities. So its reliability is very important, the validation and the evaluation of product from GLDAS often use in-situ observations. Now remote sensing has been an important observation source, but satellite observations have not directly relation with the output of GLDAS, their relationships are so complex even fuzzy with many parameters. This study analyzed the reliability of soil moisture and land surface temperature simulated by GLDAS using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data for the periods of one year based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory, Results demonstrate that both of them are relatively believable, and the land surface temperature is more reliable than the soil moisture.

TI  - Analysis of soil moisture retrieval from airborne passive/active {L}-band sensor measurements in {SMAPVEX} 2012
VL  - 9260
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key component in the hydrologic cycle and climate system. It is an important input parameter for many hydrologic and meteorological models. NASA'S upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, to be launched in October 2014, will address this need by utilizing passive and active microwave measurements at L-band, which will penetrate moderately dense canopies. In preparation for the SMAP mission, the Soil Moisture Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) was conducted from 6 June to 17 July 2012 in the Carment-Elm Creek area in Manitoba, Canada. Over a period of six weeks diverse land cover types ranging from agriculture over pasture and grassland to forested sites were re-visited several times a week. The Passive/Active L-band Sensor (PALS) provides radiometer products, vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures, and radar products. Over the past two decades, successful estimation of soil moisture has been accomplished using passive and active L-band data. However, remaining uncertainties related to surface roughness and the absorption, scattering, and emission by vegetation must be resolved before soil moisture retrieval algorithms can be applied with known and acceptable accuracy using satellite observations. This work focuses on analyzing the Passive/Active L-band Sensor observations of sites covered during SMAPVEX12, investigating the observed data, parameterizing vegetation covered surface model, modeling inversion algorithm and analyzing observed soil moisture changes over the time period of six weeks. The data and analysis results from this study are aimed at increasing the accuracy and range of validity of SMAP soil moisture retrievals via enhancing the accuracy for soil moisture retrieval.

AB  - The present study entitled "Response of soil nutrient status on leaf nutrient content and fruit yield of 'Kinnow'" was conducted at different locations of seven 'Kinnow' orchards at SriGanganagar district of Rajasthan state of India under drip irrigation system at the orchards of private fruit growers during 2005-06. The study included analysis of soil profile with respect to physical and chemical characteristics, determination of important essential plant nutrients, and analysis of 'Kinnow' fruits at fruiting time. The soil pH and calcium carbonate content were found high whereas, organic carbon, available nitrogen, available iron, available zinc were found low. The available phosphorus, available potassium, available copper and available manganese found low to medium. Analysis of leaf samples showed that phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, copper was found to be sufficient in majority of samples whereas nitrogen, zinc and manganese content were found low. The content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium in leaves ranged from 2.25 to 2.59\%, 0.13 to 0.34\%, 0.31 to 0.54\%, 1.35 to 1.94\% and 0.25 to 0.36\%, respectively whereas iron, zinc, copper and manganese lied between 17.30 to 23.60 ppm, 22.92 to 38.65 ppm, 2.80 to 4.50 ppm and 29.77 to 39.40, respectively. The correlation between leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, zinc and copper were positive and significantly correlated with available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, available iron, available zinc and available copper contents of soils. The average fruit weight, T.S.S., acidity, ascorbic acid, juice content and fruit yield varied between 108.96 to 151.39 g, 10.40 to 11.60 Â°B, 0.98 to 1.02\%, 32.93 to 36.02 mg/100 g pulp, 51.80 to 55.70 ml and 47.53 to 71.33 kg tree-1, respectively. The fruit weight and fruit yield were significantly and positively correlated with nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, zinc and copper contents of leaf.

VL  - 13
SN  - NA
AB  - Organic farming aims to stimulate soil fertility by avoiding the use of synthetic fertiliser inputs, relying instead on locally available natural resources. It is regarded by many as a sustainable alternative to conventional farming because it ensures higher biodiversity, restricts environmental pollution, prevents land degradation and is easy to apply for smallholder and subsistence farmers. Although widely practiced and studied in temperate regions, little is known about the potential overall benefits of organic farming in the tropics and subtropics. This paper addresses this gap by undertaking an analysis of the differences between organic and conventional agriculture in the tropics and sub-tropics based on an extensive literature review including 88 papers with 458 data pairs. The comparison is based on three main indicators: yield, gross margin and soil organic carbon (SOC). The differences between the organic and conventional systems for each of these main indicators is represented by the ratio of the value of the indicator in the organic system divided by the corresponding value in the conventional system. This was initially calculated for each data pair individually, and grouped by a variety of explanatory factors, such as precipitation, human development level, soil texture, crop type, organic input type, time after conversion and certification. The results demonstrate that under organic management, yields were on average 26\% higher, gross margins 51\% higher and soil organic carbon 53\% higher than under conventional management. The highest yield increases in organic cropping systems were achieved in the least developed countries, in arid regions and on coarse soils. For gross margins, certification was the main reason for differences between organic and conventional systems. Certified farmers, mostly located in developed countries, receive significantly higher prices. Furthermore, organic farming in the driest regions results in higher profits than in other regions. Even though soil organic carbon was significantly higher overall under organic management, the results do not show significant differences when grouped by the explanatory factors. They do however suggest that the highest carbon sequestration potential occurs in systems that had a high level of inputs, in regions with 1 000-1 500 mm of rainfall and on clayey soils.

TI  - An overview of neural network applications for soil moisture retrieval from radar satellite sensors
VL  - 9243
SN  - NA
AB  - Frequent and spatially distributed measurements of soil moisture (SMC), at different spatial scales, are advisable for all applications related to the environmental disciplines, such as climatology, meteorology, hydrology and agriculture. Satellite sensors operating in the low part of microwave spectrum are very suitable for this purpose, and their signals can be directly related to the moisture content of the observed surfaces, provided that all the contributions from soil and vegetation to the measured signal are properly accounted for. Among the algorithms used for the retrieval of SMC from both active (i.e. Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR or real aperture radars) and passive (radiometers) microwave sensors, the artificial neural networks (ANN) represent the best compromise between accuracy and computation speed. ANN based algorithms have been developed at IFAC, and adapted to several radar and radiometric satellite sensors, in order to generate SMC products at different spatial resolutions, varying from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. These algorithms, which use the ANN techniques for inverting theoretical and semi-empirical models, such as Advanced Integral Equation (AIEM), Oh models, and Radiative transfer Theory (RTT), have been adapted to the C-band acquisitions from SAR (Envisat/ASAR) and real aperture radar (ASCAT) and to the X-band SAR acquisitions of Cosmo-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X. Moreover, a specific ANN algorithm has also been implemented for the L-band active and passive acquisitions of the incoming SMAP mission. The latter satellite will carry onboard simultaneously one radar and one radiometer operating at the same frequency, but with different spatial resolutions (3 and 40 km, respectively). Large datasets of co-located satellite acquisitions and direct SMC measurements on several test sites located worldwide have been used along with simulations derived from forward electromagnetic models for setting up, training and validating these algorithms. An overall quality assessment of the obtained results in terms of accuracy and computational cost was carried out, and the main advantages and limitations for an operational use of these algorithms have been evaluated.

VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - A study was conducted to explore the spatial variability of major soil nutrients in a soybean grown region of Malwa plateau. From the study area, one hundred sixty two surface soil samples were collected by a random sampling strategy using GPS. Then soil physico-chemical properties i.e., pH, EC, organic carbon, soil available nutrients (N, P, K, S and Zn) were measured in laboratory. After data normalization, classical and geo-statistical analyses were used to describe soil properties and spatial correlation of soil characteristics. Spatial variability of soil physico-chemical properties was quantified through semi-variogram analysis and the respective surface maps were prepared through ordinary Kriging. Exponential model fits well with experimental semi-variogram of pH, EC, OC, available N, P, K, S and Zn. pH, EC, OC, N, P, and K has displayed moderate spatial dependence whereas S and Zn showed weak spatial dependence. Cross validation of kriged map shows that spatial prediction of soil nutrients using semi-variogram parameters is better than assuming mean of observed value for any un-sampled location. Therefore it is a suitable alternative method for accurate estimation of chemical properties of soil in un-sampled positions as compared to direct measurement which has time and costs concerned.

TI  - The {Soil} {Moisture} {Active} {Passive} ({SMAP}) radar: {Measurements} at high latitudes and of surface freeze/thaw state
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission is scheduled for a late 2014 launch date. The mission will use both active radar and passive radiometer instruments at L-Band in order to achieve the science objectives of measuring soil moisture and land surface freeze-thaw state. To achieve requirements for a wide swath at sufficiently high resolution for both active and passive channels, an instrument architecture that uses a large rotating reflector is employed. In this paper, focus will be placed on the radar design. The radar will employ synthetic-aperture processing to achieve a 'moderate' resolution dual-pol product over a 1000 km swath. Because the radar is operating continuously, very frequent temporal coverage will be achieved at high latitudes. This data will be used to produce a surface freeze/thaw state data product.

TI  - Spatial upscaling of in-situ soil moisture measurements based on {MODIS}-derived apparent thermal inertia
VL  - 138
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture plays an essential role in the terrestrial water cycle. It is very important to obtain soil moisture for many applications. Soil moisture acquired by remote sensing, land surface modeling, and data assimilation must be evaluated against in-situ measurements before being used, but a procedure should be performed to upscale the point-scale measurements to the grid-scale or footprint-scale. In this study, a new upscaling algorithm is developed by introducing MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia (ATI). First, a functional relationship between the station-averaged soil moisture and the pixel-averaged ATI is constructed. Second, this relationship is used to calculate the representative soil moisture time series at a certain spatial scale. Last, the Bayesian linear regression is applied to obtain the upscaled area-averaged soil moisture by using in-situ measurements as independent variables. The algorithm is evaluated using a network of in-situ moisture sensors in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that it can effectively obtain the area-averaged soil moisture, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.023m3/m3 before upscaling to 0.013m3/m3 after upscaling. Finally, the algorithm is implemented to the 100kmÃ—100km grid box where the network is installed, and the temporal pattern of the upscaled soil moisture agrees with the hydro-meteorological knowledge of this region.

TI  - Comparison of three methods for soil fertility quality spatial simulation with uncertainty assessment
VL  - 77
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatial information of soil fertility quality is crucial for sustainable agriculture management. This study compared three methods based on sequential Gaussian simulation for spatial simulation of soil fertility quality index (SFQI) with uncertainty assessment through a case study in Hanchuan County, China. These methods are different in data utilization and simulation procedure: Method 1 first calculates SFQI sample data from the sample data of soil fertility indicators and then simulates the spatial distribution of SFQI with incorporation of land use information; Method 2 is similar to Method 1 except that land use information is not used; and Method 3 first simulates soil quality indicators using their sample data and then derives each SFQI realization from randomly grouped realizations of different soil quality indicators. Validation showed that Method 1 had the best performance in optimal prediction in terms of correlation coefficients between measured and predicted data, global prediction errors (mean error [ME], mean absolute error [MAEE], and root mean square error [RMSE]) and uncertainty modeling (accuracy plots and goodness statistic), and Method 3 was the worst. Methods 1 and 2 achieved, respectively, relative improvements of 32.27 and 12.72\% in optimal prediction over Method 3. Probability maps estimated from simulated realizations using Method l showed that paddy fields generally had high quality grades while thefertility quality grades of dry farmlands were usually low in the study area. It is concluded that Method 1 may be a more effective method for SFQI predictionwith uncertainty assessment and Method 2 may be adopted when land use information is unavailable.

TI  - How many measurements of soil moisture within the footprint of a ground-based microwave radiometer are required to account for meter-scale spatial variability?
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Validation of ground-based microwave remote sensing measurements with point measurements of soil moisture remains an important task. We investigated the spatial process of soil moisture and sampling strategies for estimating the mean soil moisture of an area on the order of tens of square meters, over various soil moisture conditions. Validation of ground-based microwave remote sensing measurements with point measurements of soil moisture remains an important task. The number of point measurements needed to characterize the mean soil moisture of an area on the order of tens of square meters, and the manner in which these observations should be made remain unknown. We conducted a field experiment in central Iowa to characterize the spatial process of soil moisture and sampling strategies for estimating the mean soil moisture of an area that represents the footprint of a ground-based microwave radiometer. We determined the spatial dependence of the moisture content of bare soil at this scale, which allows the determination of the mean soil moisture from point measurements. This spatial dependence can be described by an exponential variogram model. The parameters of this model vary according to mean moisture conditions. The accuracy of the estimate of mean soil moisture depends on the number of point measurements, what sampling technique is used, and mean moisture conditions. When we use spatial dependence, we increase the accuracy and precision of our estimates of the mean. Lattice and stratified sampling schemes require fewer measurements than random sampling when a higher level of accuracy in the estimate of mean soil moisture is desired. Practically, if measurements of soil moisture are made in random locations and spatial dependence is not used, we found that approximately 20 measurements within a 7 by 9 m footprint would estimate the mean to within close to 0.01 m3 m-3 of the true value for the entire range of soil moisture conditions that we observed.

TI  - A physically-based algorithm for surface soil moisture retrieval in the {Tibet} {Plateau} using passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - A physically-based algorithm for surface soil moisture retrieval in the Tibetan Plateau using passive microwave remote sensing was presented. The algorithm is based on a radiative transfer model and the assumption that the vegetation optical depth is polarization independent. It combines the effects of vegetation and roughness as a single parameter and uses the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) to eliminate the effects of surface temperature and obtain soil moisture through a nonlinear iterative procedure. The advantage of this algorithm is that it needs only one frequency brightness temperature observations, and requires no field observations of roughness, soil moisture or vegetation data sets during the whole retrieval process. Finally, the algorithm was tested with the 6.9 GHz dual-polarized brightness temperature data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and compared with NASA official algorithm using in situ soil moisture from 20 stations in the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the soil moisture retrieved by the algorithm is more consistent with ground measurements than the NASA soil moisture products.

TI  - Influence of biochar incorporation on {TDR}-based soil water content measurements
VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - The incorporation of biochar (BC) into agricultural soil changes the soil's physical properties, which leads to changes in the soil's hydraulic properties, such as water retention and permeability, and alters the soil moisture environment in agricultural fields. To elucidate the effects of the incorporation of BC on the soil moisture environment, measurements of the soil water in biochar-amended agricultural fields are needed. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a widely used and established technique for the continuous measurement of the soil water content (SWC) in agricultural fields. However, TDR measurements are affected by the conductivity of soils. Biochar formed at higher pyrolysis temperatures is known to be very conductive. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the incorporation of BC on TDR-based SWC measurements. We examined calcaric dark red soil and the BC produced by pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse at 400, 600 and 800Â°C. The apparent relative permittivity (Îµa) of the BC (800Â°C)-amended soil was greater than that of the non-amended soil at a given water content, whereas the Îµa values of the soils amended with the BC (400Â°C) and BC (600Â°C) were the same as that of the non-amended soil at a given water content. We concluded that when a calibration curve obtained from a non-amended soil is used, TDR-based measurements tend to over-estimate the SWC containing the BC formed at higher pyrolysis temperatures because of conductive and dielectric losses. Therefore, the use of the real component (Îµ r â€²) of the soil's complex relative permittivity instead of Îµa is effective when making TDR-based water content measurements of soils that contain BC formed at higher pyrolysis temperatures.

AB  - The paper proposed a soil moisture retrieval model with S-band field experimental data and volumetric water content measured in field. Focused on the problem that antenna irradiated region may not meet the minimum radar resolution pixel, the research applied the multiple independent samples measuring method and analyzed the relevance between soil moisture and backscattering coefficient of S-band VV polarization. The inversion equation obtained was applied to inverse soil moisture from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) S-band images of HJ-1C (a satellite designed for environment and disaster monitoring). The inversion results were verified by the multiple independent samples data measured and agreed well with the experimental data, which shows the S-band VV polarization data can be used to monitor the soil moisture in a large scale.

TI  - Managing soil fertility to adapt to rainfall variability in smallholder cropping systems in {Zimbabwe
VL  - 154
SN  - NA
AB  - Adaptation options that address short-term climate variability are likely to lead to short-term benefits and will help to deal with future changes in climate in smallholder cropping systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this study we combined field experimentation and long-term rainfall analyses in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate cropping adaptation options to climate variability. Analyses of long-term rainfall data closely supports farmers' perceptions that the mean annual total rainfall has not changed, but the pattern of rainfall within-season has changed: the number of rainfall days has decreased, and the frequency of dry spells has increased at the critical flowering stage of maize. On-farm experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to assess the effects of planting date, fertilization and cultivar on maize production. Three maize cultivars were sown in each of the early, normal and late planting windows defined by farmers. Each of the nine cultivar-planting date combinations received N, P, K and manure combinations at either zero, low or high fertilization rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in maize development or grain yield among cultivars. Maize grain yield was increased by increasing the amount of nutrients applied. Average yield was 2.5tha-1 for the low rate and 5.0tha-1 for the high rate on early planted cultivars on relatively fertile soils in Makoni in 2009/10 season. Yields on poorer soils in Hwedza were small, averaging 1.5tha-1 for the low rate and 2.5tha-1 for the high rate. Maize grain yields for the early and normal planted cultivars were similar for each fertilization rate, suggesting there is a wide planting window for successful establishment of crops in response to increased rainfall variability. Yield reduction of {\textgreater}50\% was observed when planting was delayed by 4 weeks (late planting) regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Soil nutrient management had an overriding effect on crop production, suggesting that although the quality of within-season rainfall is decreasing, nutrient management is the priority option for adaptation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems.

TI  - Soil nitrogen mineralisation dynamics under long-term different irrigation methods in greenhouses
VL  - 63
SN  - NA
AB  - Irrigation is the only source of soil water in greenhouse cultivation. The objective of this study is to illustrate the differences in soil organic nitrogen mineralisation caused by irrigation volume and frequency, and provide theoretical bases for the process of nitrogen transformation and nitrogen fertiliser application under different irrigation methods. The soil nitrogen mineralisation process was studied by the long-term intermittent leaching aerobic incubation method which was used by Standford and Smith in 1972. Parameters of soil nitrogen mineralisation potential (N0), the mineralisation rate constant (k) and half-life period (t1/2) in different soil layers were studied in greenhouse tomato cultivation for seven years, irrigated in three ways: subsurface irrigation (SI), drip irrigation (DI) and furrow irrigation (FI). The results showed that the first-order reaction kinetic model can be used to predict the soil organic nitrogen mineralisation characteristics in a greenhouse. There were five soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 cm) in this study. In 0-20 cm soil layers, the N0 value of DI was highest, then FI, and SI was lowest. Apart from 10 to 20 cm soil layer, the k values of SI and DI were higher than for FI in other soil layers, while the t1/2 value of FI was highest, then DI, and t1/2 of SI was the lowest. The main reasons were that large amounts of water in FI would lead to increased soil bulk density and reduced soil temperature. DI with property ratio of the temperature and moisture was beneficial to organic nitrogen mineralisation. For SI, due to the overall upward movement of water for many years, nitrate accumulated and the pH value decreased in 0-20 cm soil layers. DI could increase the proportion of N0 value to the soil's total nitrogen. Therefore, according to the results of this study, DI gives the best effect on soil fertility, followed by SI and then by FI. Â© 2014 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Whole-farm management of soil nutrients drives productive grazing systems: {The} {Cicerone} farmlet experiment confirms earlier research
VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - The Cicerone Project included a study of three 53-ha farmlets, each subjected to a different management system. The systems varied first in their input of fertilisers and sown pastures and second in their grazing management. Farmlet A undertook a high level of pasture renovation and had soil fertility targets of 60 mg/kg Colwell phosphorus (P) and 10 mg/kg KCl-40 sulfur (S), while farmlets B and C both had a low rate of pasture renovation and targets of 20 mg/kg P and 6.5 mg/kg S. In addition, both farmlets A and B adopted a flexible rotational grazing regime over the eight paddocks of each farmlet, whereas farmlet C, which had 37 paddocks, adopted intensive rotational grazing. This paper first reviews the literature relating to soil fertility research in the summer-dominant rainfall region of the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. It then examines whether the soil fertility targets set for the farmlets were attained and how the consequences of fertiliser management measured in this trial related to earlier research findings. Fertiliser applications, comprising both capital and maintenance rates, were based on soil test results but at times were constrained by the availability of finance. Soil tests over 5 years indicated that only nitrogen (N), P and S varied with time within the farmlets while the other indices of soil fertility remained similar. Phosphorus and S levels increased in response to fertiliser applications whereas N levels responded to increases in legume composition, which was stimulated by the higher P and S levels. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated that farmlet productivity was driven by P and S fertility and thus the two farmlets with lower P and S fertility (farmlets B and C) had similar but lower levels of farmlet productivity compared with farmlet A. Significant increases in several measured pasture productivity parameters were observed in response to the higher P and S fertility on farmlet A, especially when climatic conditions were favourable. The results of the Cicerone farmlet experiment confirm the findings of earlier research on the Northern Tablelands, and elsewhere in the high rainfall zone, that has demonstrated that higher soil fertility levels and pasture renovation enhance the productivity of grazing enterprises more than grazing management, without imposing significant risks to the environment.

TI  - Biomass production and soil nutrients in organic and inorganic fertilized willow biomass production systems
VL  - 57
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of organic waste materials as nutrient sources for willow biomass production is an attractive means to decrease fertilization costs, increase biomass production and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the system. In this study, changes in soil nutrients and biomass production of two willow varieties (Salix miyabeana-SX64 and Salix purpurea-9882-34) in organic and synthetic fertilized systems were compared at three locations in Northeastern U.S.A: Middlebury VT (MID), Delhi NY (DEL) and Fredonia NY (FRE). A 150 and 200kg available Nha-1 of urea as commercial fertilizer (CF), biosolid compost (BC) and digested dairy manure (DM) and a control (CT0) treatments were applied in June 2008 to the willow which was re-sprouting after coppice. There was no significant difference (p{\textgreater}0.05) in biomass production among the fertilization treatments at any of the three sites and for either of the varieties. First rotation biomass production of 9882-34 ranged from 9.0 to 11.6Mgha-1yr-1 at DEL, 3.4-8.8Mgha-1yr-1 at MID and 3.5-7.7Mgha-1yr-1 at FRE. For SX64, biomass production ranged from 13.2 to 19.0Mgha-1yr-1 at DEL, 9.0-15.0Mgha-1yr-1 at Mid and 5.5-9.3Mgha-1yr-1 at FRE. SX64 deployed small numbers of large stems and produced more biomass than 9882-34 which deployed large numbers of small stems. Application of BC significantly increased soil N and P levels at MID in both 2008 and 2009 (p{\textless}0.05). At DEL, BC and DM treatments increased soil N, Ca, Mg and OM levels in both 2008 and 2009 (p{\textless}0.05). The fertilization treatments had no significant effect on any soil nutrients at FRE. This study indicates that willow biomass can be produced without fertilizer additions in the first rotation across this range of sites due to the nutrient status of these sites and high internal nutrient cycling in these systems.

TI  - Characterizing farming systems around {Kakamega} {Forest}, {Western} {Kenya}, for targeting soil fertility-enhancing technologies
VL  - 176
SN  - NA
AB  - Kakamega district in Western Kenya represents the smallholder farming systems typical for much of the densely populated humid highlands in East Africa. A specific feature, however, is the presence of a protected forest reserve (Kakamega Forest National Park), covering some 20\% of the district area. Year-round crop production with little use of external inputs is resulting in declining soil fertility and crop yields. Technologies to counteract fertility constraints are rarely implemented, as they do not consider system diversity or farm-specific characteristics. We surmised that farm type-specific targeting of technology options to address soil fertility-related production constraints would reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the resources of the adjacent Kakamega rainforest reserve. Based on Kenyan national census data, we selected 168 farms in physical proximity of the Kakamega forest and characterized them regarding production system and soil attributes. Cluster and principal component analyses identified five distinct farm categories. Three representative farms from each cluster group were subsequently selected to establish labor-use patterns, draw resource-flow maps, and determine NPK balances. Small subsistence-oriented farms were most common ({\textgreater} 50\%), with maize yields of 0.9 t ha-1 (Cluster 1). Most farmers relied on the forest to provide fire wood, animal feed, and medicinal plants. Mixed farms, combining subsistence maize with industrial crops, were differentiated by soil type, with tea being grown on Ferralsol (Cluster 3), and sugar cane being grown on Acrisol (cluster 4). The dependence on forest resources was limited to animal grazing and the collection of feed stuff (Cluster 3), or the extraction of medicinal plants (Cluster 4). Only few farms showed a high degree of market orientation of the food-crop production. These comprised either small farms with high investments in fertilizer and maize yields close to 2 t ha-1 (Cluster 2), or larger farms (1.6-3.9 ha) with low fertilizer but high hired-labor use (Cluster 5). Their reliance on forest resources was generally low. Resource flows showed mainly patterns of nutrient export in subsistence farms, and more complex flow patterns, involving several farm compartments, in the diversified farms. Partial nutrient balances were strongly negative for N and K, irrespective of soil or farm type. Soil-fertility characteristics reflected the nutrient balances with generally low C and N in all farms on Acrisol, and low P in farms not applying mineral fertilizers or farmyard manure. The proposed typology is expected to improve the targeting of technologies addressing soil fertility-related production constraints, and to reduce the pressure on forest resources. This is of particular importance in the case of small-scale subsistence and mixed farms close to the forest margin. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

TI  - Performance test of the soil nitrogen balance estimation system using lysimeter experiments conducted in andosol-based cropping systems
VL  - 51
SN  - NA
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of a simple empirical model that was previously developed to support rational fertilizer management in upland farms in Japan. Statistical criteria and graphical displays were used to evaluate the capability of the soil nitrogen (N) balance estimation system to estimate nitrate-N (NO-3-N) leaching. Longterm lysimeter experimental data of three Andosol-based cropping systems in Abashiri, Mito and Miyakonojo were used in this study. Input data included soil characteristics, crop properties, climatic data and evaluation period. Results showed good fitness (low relative root mean square error) and precision (R 2=0.57, 0.93) in Abashiri and Mito, respectively. Simulated NO- 3-N leaching agreed with observed trends for all N management schemes at the three locations. Overestimations followed by underestimations in Miyakonojo affected the system's precision (R2=0.30), thereby exposing its weakness. Simulated soil residual N strongly correlated to crop uptake and simulated and observed leached nitrate-nitrogen in Abashiri and Mito. Monthly leaching estimates showed peaks in March to April, June to July and September to October demonstrating the system's usefulness as a tool for rational fertilizer management. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the system's ability to respond to N input and output data. RRMSE and R2 for high nutrient-input treatments indicated the system's ability to estimate NO- 3-N leaching.

VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - This study conducted a long-term field trial to evaluate the effects of three farming methods (i.e., conventional farming, organic farming, and intermediate farming) on soil fertility and plant growth under a crop rotation of vegetables, sweet corn, and rice. The nitrogen (N) uptake of crops grown with chemical fertilizers (CFs) and organic fertilizers was also compared carefully over 7 consecutive years. The results revealed that only a fraction of the nitrogen N in chicken manure compost was available to crops immediately following application. Therefore, the fresh weight production and absorption of N by amaranth, water convolvulus, and sprouting broccoli plants were relatively minimal compared to those grown with chemical N fertilizers. However, the amount of N from the chicken manure compost met the nutrient requirements of rice and sweet corn. Application of chicken manure compost increased the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) and available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) content, which is essential for enhancing soil quality. Because of the rapid decomposition of rapeseed seed meal (RSM), most of the N in RSM was mineralized immediately following application, which induced the rapid growth of leafy vegetables and increased yields. Application of compost with chemical fertilizers not only results in yields as high as those from pure chemical fertilizer treatment, but also improves SOM accumulation and soil fertility.

TI  - Promoting cassava as an industrial crop in ghana: {Effects} on soil fertility and farming system sustainability
VL  - 2012
SN  - NA
AB  - Cassava is an important starchy staple crop in Ghana with per capita consumption of 152.9 kg/year. Besides being a staple food crop, cassava can be used as raw material for the production of industrial starch and ethanol. The potential of cassava as an industrial commercial crop has not been exploited to a large extent because of perceptions that cassava depletes soils. Recent finding from field studies in the forest/savannah transitional agroecological zone of Ghana indicates that when integrated in the cropping system as a form of rotation, cassava contributes significantly to maintenance of soil fertility, and thus large scale production of cassava for industrial use can contribute to poverty reduction in an environmentally responsive way. This paper discusses the role of cassava cultivation in soil fertility management and its implication for farming system sustainability and industrialization. Â© 2012 S.

AB  - Two parallel needle moisture sensors has been widely used in Soil moisture detection equipment, for example, frequency domain (FD), time domain reflectometry (TDR) and standing wave ratio (SWR) measurement. The design of probe's port impedance is key technology parameters to soil moisture sensor. In this study, according to the relationships between the length and impedance characteristics of terminal open and closed state probe were presented based on two-pin probe structure of parallel resistance model. The best probe structure was simulated by high frequency structure simulator software HFSS, which based on Maxwell's equations and finite element method. According to experiment of soil water content by organic solution, the theoretical analysis of the best structure of probe was further validated.

TI  - Influence of plant density on variability of soil fertility and nutrient budgets in low input {East} {African} highland banana ({Musa} spp. {AAA}-{EA}) cropping systems
VL  - 95
SN  - NA
AB  - The productivity of East African highland (EAH) banana cropping systems is declining, particularly in areas with low inherent soil fertility. Soil fertility management requires knowledge of nutrient flows at the interface between the soil surface and the soil system. The magnitude of soil fertility dynamics and nutrient depletion was studied for a short-term banana plant density trial in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall with low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility) using nutrient stock and partial nutrient balance calculations. Plant density did not influence significantly nutrient mass fractions in plant parts (fruit, leaves and pseudostems) but nutrients contained through shredded leaves and pseudostems and those removed through bunch dry matter increased with plant density. Plant density responses to variation in soil fertility and partial nutrient balances seemed to depend on diversity in climate and soil type. Partial N and K balances (kg ha-1 year-1) were estimated to be strongly negative at Rubona and Ruhengeri while Ca and Mg were positive at Kibungo and Ruhengeri but negative at Rubona. This study showed that partial nutrient balances associated with soil nutrient stocks can provide the first order of magnitude of nutrient depletion in low input EAH banana cropping systems. This brings attention from agricultural researchers and farmers to develop options that can improve the productivity of these systems, where resource availability for improved nutrient management is scarce.

TI  - Evaluation of standard calibration functions for eight electromagnetic soil moisture sensors
VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Eight commercially available electro-magnetc water content sensors were evaluated in seven well-characterized soils ranging from sand to clay textures, including an organic soil. Factory supplied calibrations were compared and sensor response to soil properties demonstrated. Soil-specific calibrations yielded measurement accuracies from 0.015 to 0.025. An increasing number of electromagnetc (EM) sensors are deployed to measure volumetric soil water content (q) for agricultural, ecological, and geotechnical applications. While impedance and capacitance sensors generally operate at frequencies between 20-300 MHz, time domain-refectometry (TDR) and-transmissometry (TDT) function in the GHz range. In general, lower frequency sensors are less expensive but more sensitive to confounding effects of salinity, temperature, and soil textural variations. To simplify sensor application, factory-supplied calibrations are often provided for different porous media types such as mineral, organic, and saline soils, or soilless-substrates. The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the performance of eight commercially available EM moisture sensing systems (TDR 100, CS616, Theta Probe, Hydra Probe, SM300, Wet2, 5TE, 10HS) in seven well-characterized and texturally varying soils using a standardized approach. The validity of factory supplied-calibraton relatonships was evaluated and the influence of soil properties on the EM responses for q measurements was observed. Results indicate that the factory-supplied calibraton relatonships for groups of mineral and organic soils in general performed well, but some inconsistences were identified and suggestions for improvement are discussed. Soil-specific calibrations from this study yielded accuracies of around 0.015 m3m-3 for 10HS, SM300, and Theta Probe, while lower accuracies of about 0.025 m3 m-3 were found for TDR100, CS616, Wet2, 5TE, and the Hydra Probe. These results are based on mineral soils having a large variaton in texture, electrical conductvites below 2 dS m-1, organic mater below 10\%, and specific surface areas of less than 50 m2 g-1.

VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - The research on coupling both data source is very important for improving the accuracy of Image information interpretation and target recognition. In this paper a classifier is presented, which is based on integration of both active and passive remote sensing data and the Maximum Likelihood classification for inversion of soil moisture and this method is tested in Heihe river basin, a semi-arid area in the north-west of china. In the algorithm the wavelet transform and IHS are combined to integrate TM3, TM4, TM5 and ASAR data. The method of maximum distance substitution in local region is adopted as the fusion rule for prominent expression of the detailed information in the fusion image, as well as the spectral information of TM can be retained. Then the new R, G, B components in the fusion image and the TM6 is taken as the input to the Maximum Likelihood classification, and the output corresponds to five different categories according to different grades of soil moisture. The field measurements are carried out for validation of the method. The results show that the accuracy of completely correct classification is 66.3\%, and if the discrepancy within one grade was considered to be acceptable, the precision is as high as 92.6\%. Therefore the classifier can effectively be used to reflect the distribution of soil moisture in the study area.

VL  - 368 AICT
SN  - NA
AB  - The detection method of the soil nutrients (organic matter and available N, P, K) were analyzed based on the near infrared spectroscopy technology in order to decision-making for precision fertilization. 54 samples with 7mÃ—7m was collected using DGPS receiver positioning in a soybean field. The soil organic matter, available nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K) content was determined, the near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectrum of the soil samples were obtained by FieldSpec3 spectrometer. 54 samples were randomly divided into 40 prediction sets and 14 validation sets. After smoothing, the eight principal components of original spectra were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA). Prediction model of soil organic matter, available nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K) were respectively established with the eight principal component as input and soil nutrients by measured as the output, and the 14 validation samples were predicted. The results showed that the soil organic matter, available nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K) prediction model were set up with principal component analysis and LS-SVM, which the correlation coefficients between the prediction value and measurement value were 0.8708, 0.7206, 0.8421 and 0.6858, the relative errors of the LS-SVM prediction was smaller and those mean values were 1.09\%, 1.06\%, 4.08\% and 0.69\%. The method of soil organic matter content prediction is feasible. Â© 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

TI  - Extractable soil nutrient effects on feed quality traits of crop residues in the semiarid rainfed mixed crop-livestock farming systems of {Southern} {India
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - In the mixed crop-livestock systems, while general relation among feed quality, productivity and soil nutrient management have been reported, information on the effects of extractable soil nutrients on crop residue (CR) feed quality traits is scarce (e. g. in semiarid regions of Karnataka, India). In view of the increasingly important role of CR as feed components, in these farming systems, generating such information is a relevant research issue for sustainable development. Here, we report the occurrence and strength of relationships among extractable nutrients in soils and CR feed quality traits, and the effects of improved nutrients input on feed availability and feed quality of CR. Soil samples were collected from farmers' fields in the semiarid zone of Karnataka and analyzed for available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) using standard laboratory methods. Soil test results were clustered as low, medium or high based on the level of nutrient concentration. Four major farming systems involving nine crops and 419 farms were selected for on-farm trials. Under every sample farm, a plot with farmer's practice (control) and improved fertilizer inputs (combined application of nutrients found deficient by soil testing) were laid. Performance of crops was recorded. Samples were collected for CR feed quality trait analysis using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy. The result showed that for cereal and oil crops, extractable soil S was significantly negatively associated with anti-feed quality traits such as neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) (P {\textless} 0. 01), but significantly positively related to metabolizable energy (ME) and in vitro digestibility (P {\textless} 0. 01). Extractable B and K levels were associated positively and significantly with NDF, ADF and ADL for oil crops and cereals. Crop level associations, for most crops, showed similar trend. Improved fertilizer inputs affected CR yield much more than it did the quality. It increased ME productivity (ME ha-1) and thereof the potential milk yield ha-1 by as high as 40 \% over the control. Therefore, balanced nutrient inputs on crop land positively impact productivity of the livestock compartment of mixed crop-livestock farming system, and this knowledge can build on the currently perceived need and benefits of balanced nutrient replenishment in crop-livestock system.

TI  - Mature hybrid poplar riparian buffers along farm streams produce high yields in response to soil fertility assessed using three methods
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - This study had three main objectives: (1) to evaluate the aboveground biomass and volume yield of three unrelated hybrid poplar clones in 9 year-old riparian buffer strips located on four farms of southern QuÃ©bec, Canada; (2) to compare yield data at 9 years with previous data (at 6 years); (3) to evaluate how soil fertility, measured using three different soil testing methods (soil nutrient stocks, soil nutrient concentrations, soil nutrient supply rates), is related to yield. Across the four sites, hybrid poplar productivity after 9 years ranged from 116 to 450 m3ha-1, for stem wood volume, and from 51 to 193 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha-1), for woody dry biomass. High volume and woody dry biomass yields (26.3 to 49.9 m3ha-1yr-1, and 11.4 to 21.4 Mg ha-1yr-1) were observed at the three most productive sites. From year 6 to 9, relatively high yield increases (8.9-15.1 m3ha-1yr-1) were observed at all sites, but the productivity gap between the less fertile site and the three other sites was widened. Clone MxB-915311 was the most productive across the four sites, while clone DxN-3570 was the least productive. However, at the most productive site, clone MxB-915311 experienced severe stem and branch breakages. Independently of the soil testing method used, available soil P was always the first soil factor explaining volume yield. Â© by the authors.

TI  - Do we need soil moisture measurements in the vegetation-environment studies in wetlands?
VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - Questions: Water level parameters are normally used as explanatory variables in ecological studies, but soil moisture may be more causally connected with species composition. Can measurements of volumetric soil moisture in vertical profiles using electromagnetic sensors improve vegetation-environment analyses in fens and bogs? Are there inter-habitat differences in water level-moisture relationships that could explain different sensitivities of particular vegetation types to water level changes? Location: Calcareous fens, poor fen grasslands, poor fens and ombrotrophic bogs in the Czech Republic. Methods: Monitoring of soil moisture (Profile Probe PR2), water level, pH and electrical conductivity of the water; measurements of soil pH and organic carbon; vascular plant and bryophyte data sampling; Pearson's correlations; ANOVA with post-hoc tests; PCA of environmental factors; CCA and partial CCA that controlled for the effects of pH, conductivity, and year and region of sampling; Monte Carlo permutation tests. Results: The median volumetric soil moisture correlated with the log-transformed organic carbon concentration. This correlation was particularly strong when all vegetation types were merged or when poor fens and poor fen grasslands were analysed separately. The latter vegetation types further displayed the strongest correlations between water level and uppermost soil moisture. Calcareous fens had the highest water level and the lowest correlation between water level and soil moisture. In bog profiles the moisture continuously increased downwards and its variability over time correlated with water level fluctuation less strongly than in the case of Sphagnum fens. The median water level explained most variation in species data in all cases, except for separately analysed poor fen grasslands, whose variation was best explained by soil organic carbon. Moisture characteristics became insignificant whenever water level was included into the forward selection model. Conclusions: In fens and bogs, water level still describes hydrological conditions better than directly measured moisture, and serves as a useful proxy of complex environmental conditions related to the hydrological regime, especially in Sphagnum fens with a shallow peat layer. Our results validate existing knowledge of species-environment relationships based on water table measurements. We tested whether volumetric soil moisture, measured directly in vertical profiles using electromagnetic sensors (photo), correlates with mire vegetation composition better than water table. We found that water level still serves as a better proxy of complex conditions related to the hydrological regime. Sphagnum-fens displayed stronger correlation between water level and soil moisture than bogs and, especially, than calcareous fens. Â© 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring over a semiarid region using {Envisat} {ASAR} data
VL  - 8531
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is of fundamental importance to many agricultural, hydrological and climate studies. In this paper, a simple approach for mapping near-surface SM from Envisat ASAR data was developed. Four high-resolution images covering a semiarid region in Algeria were acquired with the same sensor configuration. We performed the pretreatment using the Basic Envisat SAR Toolbox of the European Space Agency. Then, we extracted the backscattering coefficient Ïƒ0 (dB) from the filtered and calibrated images. On the other hand, five training sites with different soil physical properties and vegetation cover were selected for monitoring SM. The field campaigns were conducted concurrent to satellite image acquisitions to measure soil water content in the top five centimeters using the gravimetric method. The study of linear regressions associated to the change detection approach allowed the expression of the backscattering coefficient as a function of volumetric soil moisture (Ïƒ0 = a*Î¸ + b). The coefficients "a" and "b" of the equation slightly differ from one site to another and also from one season to the next. This difference is mainly due to the effects of surface roughness and vegetation biomass variations. Our study confirms a good agreement between the volumetric nearsurface SM and the radar backscattering coefficient for all the test fields. The comparison between measured and estimated SM proves the accuracy of the inversion models used here with a mean average error of less than 5\%. At the end, high resolution maps of soil moisture distribution were obtained from the acquired radar images. Â© 2012 SPIE.

VL  - 610-613
SN  - NA
AB  - The research on the distribution of soil nutrient contents in arable land regionally is the basis for the proper fertilization. The study, taking Hainan Island as the study area, analyzes the distribution and variation of soil nutrient contents in arable land spatially and temporally by applying GIS spatial analysis. As the study shows, from the 1980s to the year of 2005, the TN, TP, TK, and Available N contents in soil of arable land have declined to certain degree, while Available P and Available K kept increasing. Generally, the soil nutrients have declined in quality during last two decades but remain in a mediate level. Spatial analysis can reflect the distribution characteristics of the regional soil nutrient elements in an objective manner. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval by active/passive microwave remote sensing data
VL  - 8531
SN  - NA
AB  - This study develops a new algorithm for estimating bare surface soil moisture using combined active/passive microwave remote sensing on the basis of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission was jointly launched by NASA and NASDA in 1997, whose main task was to observe the precipitation of the area in 40 Â° N-40 Â° S. It was equipped with active microwave radar sensors (PR) and passive sensor microwave imager (TMI). To accurately estimate bare surface soil moisture, precipitation radar (PR) and microwave imager (TMI) are simultaneously used for observation. According to the frequency and incident angle setting of PR and TMI, we first need to establish a database which includes a large range of surface conditions; and then we use Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) to calculate the backscattering coefficient and emissivity. Meanwhile, under the accuracy of resolution, we use a simplified theoretical model (GO model) and the semi-empirical physical model (Qp Model) to redescribe the process of scattering and radiation. There are quite a lot of parameters effecting backscattering coefficient and emissivity, including soil moisture, surface root mean square height, correlation length, and the correlation function etc. Radar backscattering is strongly affected by the surface roughness, which includes the surface root mean square roughness height, surface correlation length and the correlation function we use. And emissivity is differently affected by the root mean square slope under different polarizations. In general, emissivity decreases with the root mean square slope increases in V polarization, and increases with the root mean square slope increases in H polarization. For the GO model, we found that the backscattering coefficient is only related to the root mean square slope and soil moisture when the incident angle is fixed. And for Qp Model, through the analysis, we found that there is a quite good relationship between Qpparameter and root mean square slope. So here, root mean square slope is a parameter that both models shared. Because of its big influence to backscattering and emissivity, we need to throw it out during the process of the combination of GO model and Qp model. The result we obtain from the combined model is the Fresnel reflection coefficient in the normal direction gama(0). It has a good relationship with the soil dielectric constant. In Dobson Model, there is a detailed description about Fresnel reflection coefficient and soil moisture. With the help of Dobson model and gama(0) that we have obtained, we can get the soil moisture that we want. The backscattering coefficient and emissivity data used in combined model is from TRMM/PR, TMI; with this data, we can obtain gama(0); further, we get the soil moisture by the relationship of the two parameters-gama(0) and soil moisture. To validate the accuracy of the retrieval soil moisture, there is an experiment conducted in Tibet. The soil moisture data which is used to validate the retrieval algorithm is from GAME-Tibet IOP98 Soil Moisture and Temperature Measuring System (SMTMS). There are 9 observing sites in SMTMS to validate soil moisture. Meanwhile, we use the SMTMS soil moisture data obtained by Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to do the validation. And the result shows the comparison of retrieval and measured results is very good. Through the analysis, we can see that the retrieval and measured results in D66 is nearly close; and in MS3608, the measured result is a little higher than retrieval result; in MS3637, the retrieval result is a little higher than measured result. According to the analysis of the simulation results, we found that this combined active and passive approach to retrieve the soil moisture improves the retrieval accuracy. Â© 2012 SPIE.

TI  - Off- and on-ground {GPR} techniques for field-scale soil moisture mapping
VL  - 200-201
SN  - NA
AB  - Precise measurement of shallow volumetric soil water content (VSWC) is essential in different research fields, including agriculture, hydrology and meteorology. In this research three different approaches were applied for mapping the shallow VSWC of a bare soil at the field-scale, namely, (1) the direct ground wave (DGW) method using on-ground ground-penetrating radar (GPR), (2) the surface reflection coefficient (SRC) method also using on-ground GPR, and (3) the surface reflection inversion using off-ground GPR. Measurements were conducted in an agricultural field in both relatively dry and wet conditions. Soil sampling was performed at different depths (5, 10, 20, 30, 40cm) for determining the reference VSWC. The on-ground GPR was setup using two transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) 400MHz bowtie antennas with Tx and Rx offsets of 0.16 and 1.26m, respectively, thereby setting up a multi-offset system. A vector network analyzer combined with a 0.2-2GHz TEM-horn antenna located at 1.1m above the ground was used as off-ground GPR. GPR measurements were performed following more than 10 transects in the entire field and positioning was performed using a dGPS. In addition, on-ground GPR measurements were conducted in the laboratory over a sandy soil layer including 10 different VSWC, ranging 0.02-0.18cm3.cm-3, in order to examine the SRC method for the on-ground GPR configurations. The Topp's model (1980) was used in order to transform the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil to the VSWC. Laboratory results showed that SRC method can be confidently used also for the on-ground GPR configurations when the air direct-coupling wave is subtracted from all signals. For the field data, the validation graphs using the ground-truths of the shallowest layer showed relatively reliable VSWC-maps with the RMSE values of 0.042, 0.044, and 0.059 in terms of VSWC for the SRC, DGW, and full-wave methods, respectively. In addition, the existence of a very shallow bedrock made a confusion on the detection of the DGW from the GPR data in the dry condition, but had no effect in the wet condition. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Almost all existing soil fertility management information systems run on PC with a poor mobility, which can not be used directly in the fields. This paper proposed a method using the embedded GIS technology, embedded database technology and soil nutrient balance model, to develop soil fertility management information system of Jianshui County in Yunnan Province, China. This system could run on Windows mobile 6.5 phones, PDA and other smart terminal devices. Functions of the system included viewing soil fertility information, getting fertilization formula, etc. The application of the system was good, which could guide farmers to fertilize more rationally and also help governor to develop agricultural policy.

TI  - Soil fertility and crop yields in long-term organic and conventional cropping systems in {Eastern} {Nebraska
VL  - 27
SN  - NA
AB  - Organic agriculture aims to build soil quality and provide long-term benefits to people and the environment; however, organic practices may reduce crop yields. This long-term study near Mead, NE was conducted to determine differences in soil fertility and crop yields among conventional and organic cropping systems between 1996 and 2007. The conventional system (CR) consisted of corn (Zea mays L.) or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.)-sorghum or corn-soybean, whereas the diversified conventional system (DIR) consisted of corn or sorghum-sorghum or corn-soybean-winter wheat (wheat, Triticum aestivum L.). The animal manure-based organic system (OAM) consisted of soybean-corn or sorghum-soybean-wheat, while the forage-based organic system (OFG) consisted of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa-corn or sorghum-wheat. Averaged across sampling years, soil organic matter content (OMC), P, pH, Ca, K, Mg and Zn in the top 15 cm of soil were greatest in the OAM system. However, by 2008 OMC was not different between the two organic systems despite almost two times greater carbon inputs in the OAM system. Corn, sorghum and soybean average annual yields were greatest in either of the two conventional systems (7.65, 6.36 and 2.60 Mg ha -1, respectively), whereas wheat yields were greatest in the OAM system (3.07 Mg ha -1). Relative to the mean of the conventional systems, corn yields were reduced by 13 and 33\% in the OAM and OFG systems, respectively. Similarly, sorghum yields in the OAM and OFG systems were reduced by 16 and 27\%, respectively. Soybean yields were 20\% greater in the conventional systems compared with the OAM system. However, wheat yields were 10\% greater in the OAM system compared with the conventional DIR system and 23\% greater than yield in the OFG system. Alfalfa in the OFG system yielded an average of 7.41 Mg ha -1 annually. Competitive yields of organic wheat and alfalfa along with the soil fertility benefits associated with animal manure and perennial forage suggest that aspects of the two organic systems be combined to maximize the productivity and sustainability of organic cropping systems.

TI  - Data assimilation with soil water content sensors and pedotransfer functions in soil water flow modeling
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water flow models are based on simplified assumptions about the mechanisms, processes, and parameters of water retention and flow. That causes errors in soil water flow model predictions. Data assimilation (DA) with the ensemble Kalman fi lter (EnKF) corrects modeling results based on measured state variables, information on uncertainty in measurement results and uncertainty in modeling results. The objectives of this work were (i) to evaluate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) as a source of data to generate an ensemble of Richards' equation-based models for the EnKF application to the assimilation of soil water content data and (ii) to research how effective assimilation of soil moisture sensor data can be in correcting simulated soil water content profi les in field soil. Data from a field experiment were used in which 60 two-rod time domain refl ectometry (TDR) probes were installed in a loamy soil at fi ve depths to monitor the soil water content. The ensemble of models was developed with six PTFs for water retention and four PTFs for the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). Measurements at all fi ve depths and at one or two depths were assimilated. Accounting for the temporal stability of water contents substantially decreased the estimated noise in data. Applicability of the Richards' equation was confi rmed by the satisfactory calibration results. In absence of calibration and data assimilation, simulations developed a strong bias caused by the overestimation of Ksat from PTFs. Assimilating measurements from a single depth of 15 cm or of 35 cm provided substantial improvements at all other observation depths. An increase in data assimilation frequency improved model performance between the assimilation times. Overall, bringing together developments in pedotransfer functions, temporal stability of soil water patterns, and soil water content sensors can create a new source of data to improve modeling results in soil hydrology and related fields.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The Argentine pampas is a wide plain with more than 40 million ha of land suitable for cattle rearing and cropping. Several watersheds with different hydrological characteristics and agricultural practices cover this huge region. Last decades have shown an increase in extreme conditions (droughts and floods) and the need for improving prediction models. This work is part of an ongoing project related to mapping and monitoring flooding events in La Plata Basin using spaceborne instruments, including SACD/Aquarius. Measurements of AMSR-E, SMOS, and ENVISAT/ASAR over several locations of the Pampas were analyzed. Precipitations, NDVI, PR (polarization ratios for L, C and X band), as well as both SMOS and AMSR-E soil moisture (SM) products trends were evaluated. The sensitivity and the correlation of the different trends were studied. When comparing between frequencies, the measured PRs present trends which agree with theoretical results. SMOS PRs present both higher sensitivity and dynamic range. SMOS optical depth is also shown. Finally Envisat ASAR images collected during the period analyzed are discussed. Â© 2012 IEEE.

VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - On a large scale, there is contradiction between the cost and accuracy of detection during the course of acquiring soil water content (Î¸) online. This conflict is one of the core issues of automatic water-saving irrigation technology. To solve this problem, EC-5 sensor soil temperature compensation function and soil conductivity compensation function are determined by the indoor experiments; At the same time, the area radius of information sharing for soil temperature and conductivity is determined by the outdoor experiments. The effect of soil moisture detection method of information sharing is verified on the farmland based on the determined area radius of information sharing. As the experimental results shown, the method that determines the compensation function with the least square support vector machine has a good effect, and the soil moisture detection method based on information sharing of WSN can measure soil moisture with at a lower cost and high-precision.

VL  - 40
SN  - NA
AB  - The availability of soil nutrients can have significant influence on water quality and wetland productivity. Nitrogen mineralization is the important process transferred from organic nitrogen to plant-available inorganic forms by soil animals and microorganism. Soil nitrogen mineralization processes in coastal wetlands will be greatly impacted by the significant changes of soil water and salt conditions caused by global climate change in the future. However, further studies concerning the effects of water and salt on soil nitrogen mineralization is still needed. The influences of other soil physical-chemical properties and plant community on soil nitrogen mineralization processes are also concluded. The influencing mechanism of soil nitrogen mineralization can be explained using the laboratory incubation, whereas the in situ incubation can contribute to reflecting the real nitrogen mineralization information in the field. The laboratory and in situ incubation methods combined with 15N tracing-isotope technique should be combined and applied to better reflect and explain soil nitrogen mineralization processes. Moreover, the applications of modern molecular biology techniques are also very necessary to quantitatively and accurately study nitrogen mineralization. The combined application of laboratory and in situ incubation could better reflect the real nitrogen mineralization process. Moreover, modern molecular biology techniques and 15N tracing-isotope technique are more accurate to reflect the real information of microorganism and enzyme activity.

VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry has been widely applied in the Loess Plateau of China as a means of reducing soil and water losses, restoring ecological balance, and improving both land-use efficiency and economic returns. However, agroforestry also introduces a degree of competition for soil moisture and nutrients. Walnut (Juglans regia L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and walnut-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) intercropping systems that have been used throughout the Loess Plateau were selected as the basis for a study of agroforestry system-its advantages and its disadvantages with respect to soil moisture, soil nutrients, root distributions, yields, and economic returns. The results showed that soil moisture and nutrient levels were affected by intercropping with walnut trees, and that the degree to which they were affected decreased as distance from the trees increased. On the other hand, intercropping with walnut trees can increase land-use efficiency by 75\% and economic returns by 17\%. On the basis of the study findings, we conclude that walnut-peanut and walnut-soybean intercropping can be practical and beneficial in the study region, but irrigation and fertilization methods need to be further studied and improved, root barriers should be installed at the tree-crop interface, and the distance between crops and tree rows should be adjusted to minimize competition for soil moisture and nutrients.

TI  - Soil moisture extraction from remote sensing images on compute unified device architecture support graphic processing unit
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable for understanding hydrological cycle climate change, and agricultural activities. Remote sensing images are usually utilized to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in specific areas. In many application cases, the soil moisture must be extracted as soon as possible in order to predict the characteristics of the target areas, which requires massive data processing capabilities, especially for the multiple spectral images. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming framework is emerging as a promising platform for remote sensing image processing due to its common parallel computing support, flexibility, lower cost, and compatibility with C programming language. In this paper we provide a prototypical implementation for soil moisture extraction in remote sensing images on a CUDA support platform. This prototypical implementation includes the preprocessing and analysis of remote sensing image file format, calibration, CUDA programming and pixel computation and transferring, and results storing. Based on the implementation, a case study of soil moisture estimation is provided and it suggests the applicability and efficiency of CUDA computing platform in remote sensing image processing.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - The lowland rice system in Asia makes a major contribution to the global rice supply and is often cited as an example of a sustainable system in which two or three crops of rice are grown in sequence under submerged conditions. However, water shortages are becoming critical in some regions for lowland rice cultivation; and there is high potential in exploring rice cultivation under moisture regimes that save water and also increase productivity. The objective of this article therefore is to analyze the consequences of switching growing of rice from flooded to aerobic conditions on soil fertility and its management. Fertility advantages of submerged rice include amelioration of chemical fertility, preferential accumulation of organic matter and improved availability of major, secondary and selected micronutrients, which contribute to the long-term maintenance of soil fertility and sustainability of the lowland rice system. However, the fertility problems under aerobic rice are better addressed with the crop as a component of a cropping system because continuous growing of aerobic rice in sequence does not seem sustainable due to complex, site-specific chemical and biological constraints.

TI  - A new {NIR} technique for rapid determination of soil moisture content
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - As soil moisture prediction model with the whole near-infrared spectral regions is complex and the single-band prediction model is susceptible to environmental impact, a dual-band method for measuring soil moisture content (MC) rapidly was proposed in this study. A total of 116 soil samples were collected and the NIR reflectance spectra of all soil samples were measured. The spectral data were transformed to new spectral data with logarithmic transformation and logarithmic of reciprocal transformation. The spectral bands of the new spectral data and the original spectral data that is sensitive and insensitive to soil moisture content were achieved by correlation coefficient method. The models for prediction of soil MC were developed based on single linear regression (SLR) with the sensitive spectral band and insensitive spectral band. The results show that the prediction precision of the models was high and the highest correlation coefficient of the models reached 0.9913 with the root mean square error of prediction RMSEP of 1.1983\%. Thus, it is concluded that the methods used in this paper are available methods for rapid detection of soil MC and also provides theoretical basis for developing a low-cost portable near-infrared moisture meter.

TI  - An {Observing} {System} {Simulation} {Experiment} ({OSSE}) for the {Aquarius}/{SAC}-{D} soil moisture product
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - An Observing System Simulation Experiment for the Aquarius/SAC-D mission is being developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from passive and active L-band remote sensing. The implementation of the OSSE is based on: a 1-km land surface model over the Red-Arkansas River Basin, a backscatter model and a forward microwave emission model to simulate the radiometer and scatterometer observations, a realistic orbital and sensor model to resample the measurements, and an inverse soil moisture retrieval model. The simulation implements zero-order radiative transfer model for emission and Dubois model for backscattering. Retrieval is done by direct inversion. The Aquarius OSSE attempts to capture the influence of different error sources: land surface heterogeneity, instrument noise and retrieval ancillary parameter uncertainty. In order to assess the impact of these error sources on the estimated volumetric soil moisture, a quantitative error analysis is performed through the comparison between of footprint-scale synthetic soil moisture product and high spatial resolution degraded at coarse resolution true soil moisture product. The root mean squared errors are evaluated for all the conditions. Â© 2012 IEEE.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The objective of the NASA Soil Moisture Active \& Passive (SMAP) mission is to provide global measurements of soil moisture by fused active and passive L-band microwave measurements. With an airborne campaign conducted in the Rur catchment, Germany, in 2012, an active and passive L-band microwave data set is generated. The passive Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR2) and the active L-band system DLR F-SAR were installed on the DLR Dornier DO 228 aircraft. Despite of the differences between the airborne and the future spaceborne sensors, the data set will serve as a test bed for the analysis of existing and development of enhanced future active/passive data fusion techniques. Moreover, the derivation of (vegetation) parameters for the fusion approaches is planned. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Soil fertility management effects on maize productivity and grain zinc content in smallholder farming systems of {Zimbabwe
VL  - 361
SN  - NA
AB  - Background and aims: Low soil zinc (Zn) threatens crop production and food nutrition in most cereal-based cropping systems in Africa. Agronomic management options that include farmers' locally available organic nutrient resources need to be evaluated in the context of Zn nutrition in staple cereals. A three-year study (2008-11) was conducted in two smallholder farming areas of eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate the influence of farmers' diverse soil fertility management practices on soil Zn status and effect on uptake patterns and nutritional value in maize (Zea mays L.). Methods: Participatory research approaches and formal surveys enabled identification of farmers' diverse soil fertility management practices, which were then classified into five main domains: manure or woodland litter + mineral fertilizer; sole mineral fertilizer; legume - maize rotation; and a non-fertilized control. Over 60 randomly selected farms in each study area were then surveyed for influence of identified practices on soil Zn status across the domains. Maize growth, yield and Zn uptake patterns were monitored on a sub-sample of 20 farms covering the five management domains in each study area. Results: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extractable soil Zn ranged from 0. 50 to 2. 43 mg kg-1. Different farmer management practices significantly influenced Zn uptake (p {\textless} 0. 01). Combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizer yielded {\textgreater}2. 1 t ha-1 maize grain, against {\textless};0. 8 t ha-1 in the non-fertilized control. Maize grain Zn concentrations increased by 46-64 \% over the control. Regardless of management practice, resultant phytic acid to Zn (PA: Zn) ratios were above the critical value of 15 suggesting inadequacies in current farmer management options. Conclusions: We conclude that the current farmer soil fertility management regimes are insufficient to influence Zn nutrition in maize grown without external Zn fertilization on Zimbabwean sandy soils.

TI  - A review of the methods available for estimating soil moisture and its implications for water resource management
VL  - 458-459
SN  - NA
AB  - The maintenance of elevated soil moisture is an important ecosystem service of the natural ecosystems. Understanding the patterns of soil moisture distribution is useful to a wide range of agencies concerned with the weather and climate, soil conservation, agricultural production and landscape management. However, the great heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture and the lack of standard methods to estimate this property limit its quantification and use in research. This literature based review aims to (i) compile the available knowledge on the methods used to estimate soil moisture at the landscape level, (ii) compare and evaluate the available methods on the basis of common parameters such as resource efficiency, accuracy of results and spatial coverage and (iii) identify the method that will be most useful for forested landscapes in developing countries. On the basis of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods reviewed we conclude that the direct method (gravimetric method) is accurate and inexpensive but is destructive, slow and time consuming and does not allow replications thereby having limited spatial coverage. The suitability of indirect methods depends on the cost, accuracy, response time, effort involved in installation, management and durability of the equipment. Our review concludes that measurements of soil moisture using the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) methods are instantaneously obtained and accurate. GPR may be used over larger areas (up to 500 Ã— 500. m a day) but is not cost-effective and difficult to use in forested landscapes in comparison to TDR. This review will be helpful to researchers, foresters, natural resource managers and agricultural scientists in selecting the appropriate method for estimation of soil moisture keeping in view the time and resources available to them and to generate information for efficient allocation of water resources and maintenance of soil moisture regime.

AB  - Low yield and nitrogen deficiency coexist in corn crop, especially under subsistenceoriented systems. Thus, this work aimed to assess the effect of different types of green manure in maize succession, under minimum and conventional tillage, on soil nutrient input, nutritional state, and maize productive features for ear production. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, in a split-plot scheme, with three replications, under field conditions in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The main plots were constituted by the following types of green manure: sunnhep [Crotalaria juncea), jack beans (Canavalia ensiformes), fodder turnip (Rafhanus sativus), and green manure mixture (sunnhep + jack beans + fodder turnip), besides a treatment with weeds under fallow conditions. The subplots were constituted by conventional and minimum tillage management. Yield was affected by the different types of green manure, with lower values being identified in weed succession. In general, greater plant growth was observed in minimum tillage and higher maize plant density in conventional tillage. However, ear yield was not affected by soil tillage. Higher contents of potassium and phosphorus in 0-10 cm layer depth were observed under minimum tillage, while better K/Mg balance was observed on maize plants under conventional management.

AB  - Agricultural management cropping systems play an important role in affecting a crop plantâ€™s ability to tolerate or resist insect pests. Field studies were conducted to examine the effect of two strategies management systems: fertilizer treatment and intercropping soybean with corn on soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) population and soybean growth and yield parameters. The intercropping treatments were: soybean alone; 2:1 soybean/corn intercrop; and 3:1 soybean/corn intercrop. While the soil fertility treatments were the combination of NPK (urea 100 kg ha-1 + SP-36 200 kg ha-1 + KCl 200 kg ha-1) levels, dolomite (4 ton ha-1), compost (10 ton ha-1), and chicken manure (10 ton ha-1). The results of the first study showed that the intercropping soybean with corn significantly reduced the population density of soybean aphids. However, there were no significant effects of intercropping systems on soybean growth (plant height) and yield (number seed per pod and thousand seed weight) performances except on the number of soybean pods per plant. Meanwhile, the result of the second study indicated that soil fertilizer treatments had a significant effect on the soybean plant characteristics: leaf numbers; pod numbers; and plant height. Combining intercropping methods and soil fertilizer management offer an opportunity to protect the soybean plants by natural and sustainable pest management.

AB  - Soil Moisture (SM), being one of the main variables within the system that controls the hydrological interactions among soil, vegetation and atmosphere, plays a key role in the water cycle. Satellite systems, both active and passive, have already demonstrated their capability to provide reliable SM measurements. The European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched in November 2009, was the first specific SM satellite mission. In this work we assessed the capability of SMOS data to accurately capture SM dynamics over a long time period by comparing them with in situ observations. To better assess the performance of such results, they were also compared with those obtained with alternative satellite-based SM products, considering in particular those generated by Advanced Microwave Sounding Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) data.

TI  - Long term analysis of {PALS} soil moisture campaign measurements for global soil moisture algorithm development
VL  - 121
SN  - NA
AB  - An important component of satellite-based soil moisture algorithm development and validation is the comparison of coincident remote sensing and in situ observations that are typically provided by intensive field campaigns. The planned NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has unique requirements compared to previous soil moisture satellite programs because both active and passive microwave observations are needed. The primary source of these combined observations has been an aircraft-based SMAP simulator called PALS (Passive and Active L-band System). This paper presents an overview of the field experiment data collected using PALS that spans 10. years. Data from the various campaigns were merged to form a single data set. Analyses showed that the data set contains an extensive range of soil moisture values collected under a variety of conditions and that the quality of both the PALS and ground truth data meets the needs of SMAP algorithm development and validation. The study suggests that the data set should be expanded in order to achieve globally representative land cover diversity and that more observations under dense vegetation conditions and longer time series would be desirable.

AB  - This paper mainly focuses on the evaluation of the soil fertility levels based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method and production forecasting by neural networks. By combining these two methods (the PCA and the neural networks), we propose a model to describe the relationship between the soil fertility and the crop yield, and present predictions on the yield under different fertilizer models. Some experiments are also given, demonstrating the validity of the combination method. Results show that the proposed model could improve the evaluation accuracy, and optimize the data structure of the neural network model. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Multi-factor evaluation and modeling correction of {EC}-5 and {5TE} soil moisture content sensors
VL  - 28
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil property information is vital to plant growth and is a fundamental eco-system resource for terrestrial vegetation, especially soil moisture content (SMC), soil electrical conductivity (EC) and near-surface soil temperature. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology enables monitoring soil water content changes with a high spatial and temporal resolution; however, WSN specifically requests sensors with features of low-cost, energy efficiency, dependability, and ease-of-use. In this paper, after evaluating different sensors under the demand of WSN application, a pair of ECH 2O sensors were chosen and tested under experiments based on a standardized sensor characterization methodology using liquid medium. The results show that the electronics of the EC-5 and the 5TE are sensitive to temperature, electric conductivity and pH variations. In terms of the 5TE, conductivity correction is more necessary than temperature and pH, and the R 2 of the conductivity correction equation reaches 0.918. However, though encountering the same temperature stability as the 5TE, EC-5 exhibits an opposite characteristic when it comes to conductivity and pH correction where pH compensation plays a more essential part with a calibrated R 2 of 0.978. Moreover, the inherent temperature measuring ability of 5TE is dissatisfying and the calibration with a R 2 of 0.993 is well generated, but the conductivity measuring function is well acceptable. Generally, it is concluded that both the 5TE sensor and the EC-5 sensor are suitable for WSN applications. Besides, this paper also suggested that temperature, electric conductivity and pH effects have to be compensated using appropriate correction functions respectively and various compensation models were provided accordingly.

TI  - Heated optical fiber for distributed soil-moisture measurements: {A} lysimeter experiment
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - An Actively Heated Fiber Optics (AHFO) method to estimate soil moisture is tested and the analysis technique improved on. The measurements were performed in a lysimeter uniformly packed with loam soil with variable water content profiles. In the first meter of the soil pro- file, 30 m of fiber optic cable were installed in a 12 loops coil. The metal sheath armoring the fiber cable was used as an electrical resistance heater to generate a heat pulse, and the soil response was monitored with a Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system. We study the cooling following three continuous heat pulses of 120 s at 36 W m-1 by means of long- time approximation of radial heat conduction. The soil volumetric water contents were then inferred from the estimated thermal conductivities through a specifically calibrated model relating thermal conductivity and volumetric water content. To use the pre-asymptotic data we employed a time correction that allowed the volumetric water content to be esti- mated with a precision of 0.01-0.035 (m3 m-3). A comparison of the AHFO measurements with soil-moisture measurements obtained with calibrated capacitance-based probes gave good agreement for wetier soils [discrepancy between the two methods was less than 0.04 (m3 m-3)]. In the shallow drier soils, the AHFO method underestimated the volumetric water content due to the longer time required for the temperature increment to become asymp- totic in less thermally conductive media [discrepancy between the two methods was larger than 0.1 (m3 m-3)]. The present work suggests that future applications of the AHFO method should include longer heat pulses, that longer heating and cooling events are analyzed, and, temperature increments ideally be measured with higher frequency.

TI  - Effects of chicken manure application on crop yields and soil nutrients accumulation in wheat-corn rotation system
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Aimed at resolving the unreasonable disposition and disadvantage to environment of poultry manures, the research on the effect of different chicken manure rates on crop yields and the soil nutrients accumulation were carried out by a field plot experiment. The results showed that a appropriate application rate of chicken manure significantly increased the yield of wheat. No obvious differences of corn yield were observed among the treatments of different chicken manure application rates. The soil organic matter, total nitrogen(N), total phosphorus (P), total Zinc (Zn) and nitrate (NO3 - N), available P and available Zn contents significantly increased with the increasing rates of the chicken manure respectively. The soil organic matter, N, P and Zn supply could be maintained by the combined application of the low chicken manure rate (15 t/hm2) and chemical fertilizer in the wheat season. Compared with the check treatment (CK) with no chicken manure, the contents of soil nitrate, available P and available Zn increased when the rate of chicken manure were 90 t/hm2 and 150 t/hm2, respectively. After one cycle of wheat-corn rotation, compared with CK, the chicken manures application at a rate of 90 t/hm2 increased soil NO3 - N, available P and available Zn content by 68.29\%, 91.37\% and 77.02\%, respectively. For the chicken manures treatment at 150 t/hm2, soil NO3 - N, available P and available Zn content were increased by 69.58\%, 133.16\%and 177.7\%, respectively. Â© 2012 IEEE.

TI  - Sensor technologies for precision soil nutrient management and monitoring
VL  - 7
SN  - NA
AB  - Problem statement: Growing concerns about the need to increase crop productivity without causing environmental injury have led to the deployment of site-specific strategies in soil nutrient management, where nutrients are applied in variable rates to fit local requirements. Variable rate application of nutrients is typically based on a rigorous sampling regime and time-consuming data analyses. The ability to monitor soil nutrient concentration efficiently is highly desirable. Approach: Onsite monitoring of soil nutrient concentration offers the opportunity for higher density measurements at relatively lower costs. This would allow for an efficient mapping of nutrient variability to facilitate variable-rate nutrient application. Results: Implementation of nutrient management programs using sensor technology potentially promotes environmental stewardship while maintaining crop productivity and profitability. Rapid and non-destructive quantification of spatially-variable soil nutrients has been made possible with on-the-go sensors such as optical, electromagnetic and electrochemical sensors. Conclusion: This review demonstrates the potential of on-the-go sensors for non-destructive and rapid characterization of soil nutrient variability within crop fields. Â© 2012 Science Publications.

TI  - Soil nutrient dynamics and loss risks in a chicken-forage mulberry-medicinal plant intercropping system
VL  - 32
SN  - NA
AB  - Miyun Reservoir is the main source of drinking water for Beijing. However, it is increasingly threatened by losses of nitrogen and phosphorus from slope farmland in the drinking water source protection catchment. A contour hedgerow intercropping system of forage mulberry (Morus multicaulis Perr.) and medicinal plant was planted to control and mitigate the non-point source contaminants in the catchment. Free-range Beijing Fatty Chickens were raised in the intercropping areas (free-range mode) to feed on mulberry additives in the adjacent areas (feeding mode). Topsoil samples from the two modes were collected for determination of organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents, and mulberry samples from the free-range mode and its control were collected for determination of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents in the plant. The results showed that compared with the controls, the soil organic matter content (OM), total nitrogen(TN), available N, P and K, and nitrate of the two mode areas increased significantly, which promoted the growth of the mulberry and medicinal plant and the nutrient uptake; the soil organic matter, TN and total phosphorus(TP) were greater in the feeding and free-range mode with high density of 60 and low density of 20 chickens per mu, respectively, than those in the free-range mode. However, compared with the upper parts of the slope farmland in the free-range chickens with high density, the soil available N, P and K at the lower parts of the slope farmland were increased by 20. 3\%, 71. 9\% and 21. 9\%, respectively. It suggests that the soil nutrient accumulation could be related to the feeding density and runoff. The nitrogen and phosphorus loads from chicken manure in the feeding mode were 189kg/ hm2 and 84. 8kg/hm2, respectively, which exceeded the EU (European Union) limits of 170kg N/hm2 and 80kg P2 O5/hm2, respectively; it could lead to high N and P losses to the Reservoir. The N and P loads in the free-range mode were 75. 6kg/hm2 and 33. 9kg/hm2, respectively, much less than the environmental limits, thus resulting in less risk of nutrient losses. Therefore, the decomposition and mineralization of chicken manure in the contour hedgerow intercropping system of forage mulberry and medicinal plant can supply nutrients to the intercropping plants, on the other hand, it can effectively prevent the loss of organic matter and nitrogen and phosphorus, and provide feed to free-range chickens. These results suggest that the intercropping system of forage mulberry/ medicinal plant/ low-density free-range chicken is an effective ecological mode for controlling and mitigating water contamination by agricultural non-point source pollution in the catchment.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - The threats of soil nutrient depletion and food insecurity due to unsustainable farming practices are the problems for most of developing countries including of Ethiopia. This investigation was conducted to determine the status of soil nutrient stock under different land use types in the smallholder farmers and to evaluate the relationship between N, P and K stocks, different soil parameters and land use types. Soil samples were collected from each land use types and tested in laboratory for bulk density, \% sand, \% silt, \% clay, total N, total P and total K. Soil N, P and K stocks for the land use types were calculated through multiplying the concentration of N, P and K with their respective bulk density and sampling depth. Mean comparisons were carried out to soil bulk density, \% sand, \% silt, \% clay, total N, total P and total K. One way ANOVA was used to determine N, P and K stocks significant difference (p = 0.05) under different land use types. Also, 2-tiled Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between soil nutrient stocks, soil parameters and land use types. Accordingly, the mean values of soil physico-chemical properties were varied among land use types but none significant difference (p{\textless}0.05) was observed for N, P and K stock. Because, soil nutrient management practices applied to each land use types are not adequate to improve soil nutrient stocks and compensate losses. There was a positive correlation between some soil physico-chemical properties, nutrient stocks and land use types. Therefore, to improve soil nutrient stocks and availability of nutrients for plants in order to achieve food security intensive soil nutrient management practice across land use types are compulsory.

SN  - NA
AB  - Taking four types of slopes as test objects this paper measured their, soil nutrient and soil enzyme activity. The results showed that variation of soil nutrients in different slopes is obvious; soil enzyme activity is also a significant difference between different slopes. The soil of A slope (natural secondary forest ) was the highest in activity of urease, invertase, neutral phosphatase and catalase, the lowest in D(wasteland)slope except catalase. There were extremely significant positive correlations among soil urease activity, invertase activity and neutral phosphatase activity. Significant positive correlations were observed between soil urease activity, invertase activity, neutral phosphates activity and organic matter, available N, total N. It suggested that enzymatic activity could be used to indicate and estimate soil fertility of artificial remediation slopes. Combined with and community structure and community characteristics of vegetation on the sanmpled slops, soil enzyme activities could be used to measure the degree of vegetation restoration in the disturbed area.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor for agricultural production and drought monitoring, and soil moisture retrieval for Tibetan plateau has an important practical significance for global climate change and flood monitoring. In this paper, the radiative transfer progress is built to measure the exchange from the soil surface to vegetation. In order to retrieval the soil moisture, the vegetation optical depth is calculated by microwave polarization difference index (MPDI), and brightness temperature data is obtained by AMSRE L3 data; at the same time, some surface soil parameters such as surface roughness and soil dielectric are estimated by establishing soil dielectric constant model. So the soil moisture result would be calculated by using microwave radiation transfer equation and the soil dielectric constant model. Finally the distribution of the soil moisture on Tibetan Plateau is obtained. Â© 2011 IEEE.

VL  - 8286
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave remote sensing has become an important way of soil moisture retrieval because of its better penetration into vegetation and soil layers, and its higher sensitivity to the content of soil moisture. Retrieval by active or passive method has a series of mature algorithms, and the combined active-passive methods are the recent research highlights. But the existing combined algorithms are not mature enough, with their weaker applicability and lower accuracy. This study aims to solve the problem of low accuracy, and proposes a new algorithm: based on the imitation of water-cloud model and IEM model, with a BP neural network, obtaining its own sensitive surface parameters from active and passive microwave remote sensing data, and developing a new combined active-passive retrieval model for soil moisture. Finally with testing and verifying in SMEX02 experiments, the model presented the results of higher accuracy. Â© 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - In order to reduce the negative influences of subjective factors, the research aims to build the evaluation model of soil fertility by applying the entropy weight coefficient method. Taking the influence of every factor in the soil fertility into comprehensive consideration, the researcher worked out the weight value of evaluation index and obtained the soil fertility's comprehensive index value under the guidance of entropy theory. The results prove that entropy weight coefficient method has high accuracy and some subjective factors can be avoided because of the application of entropy.

SN  - NA
AB  - To achieve a soil moisture estimation (ms) in an accurate way is crucial to understand the water cycle response and avoid traditional runoff estimations where the ms is assumed as a constant value. The aim of this study is the implementation of optical-radar images into a model to estimate ms in the Zapotes Lagoon System in Tabasco, Mexico. The satellite images used were Landsat TM and ETM+ sensors, Envisat and also in situ measurements and MDT were available. The field measurements at the soil profile showed a clear pattern of the water movement into the basin corresponding to the lower parts of the system (lagoons). The land use analysis obtained with the optical images indicated a strong change in the floodplain due to the construction of protect barriers around the Villahermosa city losing its hydrological capacity. This allows the identification of three main covers (soil, vegetation and air) that were monitored and feed to the model (MIMICS) in order to estimate ms using the Envisat image. Results provided an empirical equation that relates the ms with the backscattering coefficient. Â© 2011 IEEE.

SN  - NA
AB  - A distributed flexible strip-type soil moisture sensing and detection system based on the principle of parallel transmission line distribution parameter measurement is introduced. The changes of soil moisture in some regions will cause the changes of distribution impedance in the strip-type flexible strip-type parallel transmission line which buried in the soil, when a high-speed pulse signal transmit through the transmission line, and the changes of distribution impedance lead to a reflected signal of the pulse in time domain. The soil moisture around the transmission line can be measured by studying the reflected signal. The results of experiments shows, the distributed soil moisture measurement system is able to measure the soil moisture changes of any regions around the long-distance transmission lines. Through this transmission line sensor, it can realize the monitoring work of the soil moisture changes and gradient of changes on different layers or different regions, and the system is quite suitable for the early warning of geological disasters and agricultural scientific production applications.

TI  - Effects of beef cow winter feeding systems, pen manure and compost on soil nitrogen and phosphorous amounts and distribution, soil density, and crop biomass
VL  - 92
SN  - NA
AB  - A field experiment was conducted on continuous barley to evaluate the effects of 3 beef cattle winter feeding systems (bale grazing (BG); swath grazing (SG); straw-chaff grazing (STCH)) and pen manure and compost application on soil N and P amounts and distribution, soil density and barley crop biomass. Cattle winter feeding systems were managed during the winter of 2005-2006. Effects of extensive winter feeding system on soil nutrients and soil density were determined in the spring of 2006 after winter feeding. Nitrate nitrogen (NO 3-N) amounts at the low slope position in the 0-15 cm depth were 53\% higher (P {\textless} 0.10) on BG sites than STCH sites. This may be attributed to the larger concentration of feed, thus feed nutrients, in the BG wintering system. Phosphorus amounts on the BG wintering sites at high slope were 34\% higher (P {\textless} 0.10) than amounts at the same slope on the SG or STCH sites. Soil density was 21\% greater (P {\textless} 0.10) where cows BG compared to where cows grazed straw-chaff piles, indicating differences in soil strength and resistance to penetration by roots. Soil density decreased on compost and raw manure sites in comparison to where no manure was applied, thus validating the benefits of manure on soil structure. Crop biomass measured on BG sites was consistent with soil nutrients captured, resulting in a 15\% greater (P {\textless} 0.10) total biomass compared to STCH and SG wintering sites. Soil nutrient and crop biomass distribution was consistent among winter feeding sites with the STCH sites having the most uniform distribution of nutrients and crop biomass, and the BG sites having the least. Managing manure nutrients from winter feeding systems can be beneficial when followed by an annual cropping system. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Proper soil moisture content is one of the necessary conditions for crop growth and steady yield. The soil moisture real time measurement is the basis of reasonable irrigation and an effective way for saving water resources. This paper presented a real-time monitoring system of volumetric soil moisture content. The system consisted of field data collection terminal and monitor center. The data is transmitted by wireless communication between the measurement field and monitor center. The soil moisture content is obtained by measuring the sensor frequency variation with the soil dielectric constant. With solar cell, solar energy was collected and stored in accumulator cell to provide power supply for field data collection terminal. The experimental result shows the system is operating good and working stably, it is promising to be used for real time measurement of soil moisture. Â© (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Monitoring the amount of moisture held in the soil is critical in the management of risk for the agriculture sector. Extremes in soil moisture can lead to devastating consequences. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been acquiring RADARSAT-2 data since 2008 to evaluate the accuracy with which this sensor can provide soil moisture to assist with implementing risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture sector. Using the calibrated Integral Equation Model, and a total of 16 data sets, field level soil moisture was estimated to a mean average error of 7.7\%. At a regional scale, mean errors fell to 3.23\%. The model was also able to detect wetting and drying events with inputs of RADARSAT-2 data. Â© 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Better placement of soil moisture point measurements guided by {2D} resistivity tomography for improved irrigation scheduling
VL  - 49
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture beneath irrigated crops has traditionally been determined using point measurement methods such as neutron probes or capacitance systems. These approaches cannot measure soil moisture at depths beyond the root-zone of plants and have limited lateral coverage. It is shown that surface two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can be used to map the spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture throughout a field under irrigated cotton. The case study demonstrates that ERT provides a better understanding of the pathways of water migration, and provides spatial information on how water storage changes throughout the growing season. We conclude that ERT should be integrated into farm water management surveys to delineate zones of excessive water loss due to deep drainage and to improve the positioning of point measurement methods for measuring soil moisture, thereby improving irrigation scheduling.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - The present study was undertaken to quantify changes in the status of soil nutrients, their depletion and build-up after continuous long intensive cropping for last 36 years in a permanent manorial trial which has been in progress since 1972 in an alfisol of western Himalayas. The rotation was maize-wheat which included various combinations of N, P, K, Zn and FYM (farmyard manure). Continuous cultivation influenced pH, OC (organic carbon), available N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus) and K (potassium). An increase in the status of organic carbon was observed in 100\% NPK + FYM treatments for more than three decades from initial value of 7.9 to 12.0 g/kg. The use of either FYM or lime alongwith 100\% NPK sustained crop productivity or improved nutrient status. However, imbalanced use of nutrients i.e. NP or N alone is adversely affecting the fertility of soil by aggravating the problem of soil acidity. Application of S free P fertilizer DAP (diammonium phosphate) drastically reduced the yield of both the crops. Thus, continuous use of balanced fertilizers is necessary for sustaining soil fertility and productivity of crops.

TI  - What perspective in remote sensing of soil moisture for hydrological applications by coarse-resolution sensors
VL  - 8174
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key state variable in hydrology, it controls the proportion of rainfall that infiltrates, runoff and evaporates from the land. For hydrological applications, soil moisture monitoring at catchment scale is required and, for that, microwave remote sensing sensors might be used. However, due to their coarse-spatial resolution, the skepticism on the suitability to retrieve the soil moisture at catchment scale takes still place. This work attempts to bring out if coarse-resolution sensors for soil moisture monitoring can have some perspectives for hydrological applications. Two soil moisture products derived from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) are used for this purpose. The analysis is addressed by investigating: (i) the reliability of product data in the estimation of the wetness conditions of a catchment antecedent to rainfall events, and (ii) the benefit on runoff prediction if data are assimilated into a rainfall-runoff model. Rainfall-runoff observations are taken from several catchments in Italy and Luxembourg for testing. Results reveal that ASCAT and AMSR-E soil moisture products can be conveniently used to improve runoff prediction thus opening new important challenges and opportunities for the use of this new sources of data in the operational hydrology.

TI  - Communicating complexity: {Integrated} assessment of trade-offs concerning soil fertility management within {African} farming systems to support innovation and development
VL  - 104
SN  - NA
AB  - African farming systems are highly heterogeneous: between agroecological and socioeconomic environments, in the wide variability in farmers' resource endowments and in farm management. This means that single solutions (or 'silver bullets') for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term 'best-fit' technologies - technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not 'just another computer model'! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through 'maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation through {ASCAT} and {AMSR}-{E} sensors: {An} intercomparison and validation study across {Europe
VL  - 115
SN  - NA
AB  - Global soil moisture products retrieved from various remote sensing sensors are becoming readily available with a nearly daily temporal resolution. Active and passive microwave sensors are generally considered as the best technologies for retrieving soil moisture from space. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) on-board the Aqua satellite and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the MetOp (Meteorological Operational) satellite are among the sensors most widely used for soil moisture retrieval in the last years. However, due to differences in the spatial resolution, observation depths and measurement uncertainties, validation of satellite data with in situ observations and/or modelled data is not straightforward. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of soil moisture estimations from the ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors is carried out by using observed and modelled soil moisture data over 17 sites located in 4 countries across Europe (Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg). As regards satellite data, products generated by implementing three different algorithms with AMSR-E data are considered: (i) the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, LPRM, (ii) the standard NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) algorithm, and (iii) the Polarization Ratio Index, PRI. For ASCAT the Vienna University of Technology, TUWIEN, change detection algorithm is employed. An exponential filter is applied to approach root-zone soil moisture. Moreover, two different scaling strategies, based respectively on linear regression correction and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) matching, are employed to remove systematic differences between satellite and site-specific soil moisture data. Results are shown in terms of both relative soil moisture values (i.e., between 0 and 1) and anomalies from the climatological expectation. Among the three soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E sensor data, for most sites the highest correlation with observed and modelled data is found using the LPRM algorithm. Considering relative soil moisture values for an . 5. cm soil layer, the TUWIEN ASCAT product outperforms AMSR-E over all sites in France and central Italy while similar results are obtained in all other regions. Specifically, the average correlation coefficient with observed (modelled) data equals to 0.71 (0.74) and 0.62 (0.72) for ASCAT and AMSR-E-LPRM, respectively. Correlation values increase up to 0.81 (0.81) and 0.69 (0.77) for the two satellite products when exponential filtering and CDF matching approaches are applied. On the other hand, considering the anomalies, correlation values decrease but, more significantly, in this case ASCAT outperforms all the other products for all sites except the Spanish ones. Overall, the reliability of all the satellite soil moisture products was found to decrease with increasing vegetation density and to be in good accordance with previous studies. The results provide an overview of the ASCAT and AMSR-E reliability and robustness over different regions in Europe, thereby highlighting advantages and shortcomings for the effective use of these data sets for operational applications such as flood forecasting and numerical weather prediction.

TI  - Sampling procedure simulating on-the-go sensing for soil nutrients
VL  - 174
SN  - NA
AB  - The emergence of a new sensor technology based on the use of ion-selective membranes provides an increasing number of opportunities for on-the-go field measurements of soil nutrients and soil pH. In the future, on-the-go sensing should provide a cost-effective monitoring of heterogeneous soils with high sampling resolution. It is suitable for site-specific management because it can be focused on the spatial representativity of observation. This study evaluates the on-the-go-sensing sampling design by comparing it with a standard approach to soil sampling for soil pH and the base nutrients P, K, and Mg under local field conditions in Germany. Soil samples were taken in two test sites at a resolution and in a manner as if they were sampled with an on-the-go sensing system and were compared with soil samples taken at a coarser resolution and with standard methods. In general, a higher variability was observed among the on-the-go samples due to their smaller sample support. The finer sampling resolution of the on-the-go design improved field-scale semivariogram-analysis results, identifying the spatial structures for soil pH, P, and Mg clearly. In addition, kriged maps of these soil parameters had predominantly higher estimation accuracies. However, the on-the-go samples were strongly influenced by the small-scale variability of K in one of the test sites. This variability increased the kriging standard deviation for K by 50\% compared with standard sampling design. Despite of this problem, the on-the-go-sensing sampling design revealed field-scale spatial variability for base nutrient status more accurately. Except for K, the mean absolute error of fertilizer-application maps was reduced when using the on-the-go sample design in comparison with the standard sample design (Ca: 210/268 kg ha-1, P: 2.85/6.75 kg ha-1, K: 13.7/6.0 kg ha-1, Mg 5.7/6.8 kg ha-1). This will reduce over- and underfertilization using variable-rate fertilizer-application systems. In the future, it will be of interest if real on-the-go soil-sensor measurements exhibit the same variability behavior addressed here or if results will differ substantially.

AB  - The drought is the most common natural disaster in the world, and the soil moisture content is one of the main indicators of drought monitoring. This study took the semi-arid region in northern Henan province as the study area and used Landsat-TM of 2008 remote image to set up the empirical model for getting the reflectance of the earth surface. The influence of vegetation on the pixel reflectance was eliminated by optical vegetation coverage model. Quantitative analysis model between remote data and ground measured data was established using spectroscopy which is based on the visible and near-infrared. And then we inversed the soil moisture content of surface ground and produced distribution maps of soil moisture. The accuracy of the retrieved results was validated by in situ data. The results showed that the theoretical and practical precision were 82.07\% and 91.69\%, respectively, it was suggested that the remote sensing quantitative retrieval of soil moisture content was scientifically available in semi-arid regions. All these researches can provide a basis support for the spatial distribution regulation of soil moistureinverted commas ecological protection and restoration of water resources. Â©2010 IEEE.

VL  - 339
SN  - NA
AB  - Yield increases of cucumber following cover crops in a rotation system have been previously reported for intensive Chinese agricultural production. However, little information is available as to how this system affects soil microbial properties and nematodes. A 4-year field experiment on a greenhouse cucumber double-cropping system was conducted to investigate the effects of four different summer cover crops on cucumber yield, soil nutrients, microbial properties and nematodes. After 4 years, six cover crop and residue management rotational cropping systems that included sweet corn residue removed (SR), sweet corn residue incorporated (SI), and garland chrysanthemum and edible amaranth (GR) significantly (P{\textless}0.05) increased cucumber fruit yields summed for the years 2005-2008 by 22\%, 32\% and 26\%, compared to the control (CONTROL), while cropping systems that included common bean residue removed (CR) and common bean residue incorporated (CI) significantly (P{\textless}0.05) decreased yields by 30\% and 22\%, respectively. Plant available N losses and P, K accumulation in soil were efficiently reduced by planting cover crops. Soil microbial biomass, population and diversity were higher under summer cover crop-related treatments than under the control. The dominant plant-parasitic nematodes found in our experiment field were Meloidogyne sp. and Helicotylenchus sp, which were all parasites of both common bean and cucumber. A strong relationship between cucumber yields and the non-plant-parasitic: plant-parasitic nematode ratio (NPR) (r=0.703, p{\textless}0.001) was found in the break-host systems (SR, SI and GR). These results suggested that on the nutrient rich soils of our study, cucumber yield increases for the SR, SI and GR treatments, compared with the control, could be explained by higher microbial biomass, population and diversity and NPR.

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - The Mehlich 1 (M1) soil-test method has been used for soil phosphorus (P) extraction in southern Brazil. The objective of this work was to compare M1, Mehlich 3 (M3), and ionic exchange resin (resin) soil-test methods to evaluate the soil P available for crops and grasses in soils amended with phosphate rock (PR). Oxisol and Alfisol received triple superphosphate (TS) and PR. The M1 solution extracted greater P amounts in soils amended with PR compared with the M3 solution and resin methods. Lesser P amounts were extracted with the M3 solution. Crops yields were better associated with the P amounts extracted with M3 and resin methods in soils amended with PR. The results showed that M1 overestimates soil P availability to plants in soils amended with PR; the M3 solution best estimated the soil P available for crops and grasses in soils amended with PR.

TI  - Managing soil fertility diversity to enhance resource use efficiencies in smallholder farming systems: {A} case from {Murewa} {District}, {Zimbabwe
VL  - 90
SN  - NA
AB  - Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan African exhibit substantial heterogeneity in soil fertility, and nutrient resource allocation strategies that address this variability are required to increase nutrient use efficiencies. We applied the Field-scale resource Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long-term soil fertility Development (FIELD) model to explore consequences of various manure and fertilizer application strategies on crop productivity and soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics on farms varying in resource endowment in a case study village in Murewa District, Zimbabwe. FIELD simulated a rapid decline in SOC and maize yields when native woodlands were cleared for maize cultivation without fertilizer inputs coupled with removal of crop residues. Applications of 10 t manure ha-1 year-1 for 10 years were required to restore maize productivity to the yields attainable under native woodland. Long-term application of manure at 5 and 3 t ha-1 resulted in SOC contents comparable to zones of high and medium soil fertility observed on farms of wealthy cattle owners. Targeting manure application to restore SOC to 50-60\% of contents under native woodlands was sufficient to increase productivity to 90\% of attainable yields. Short-term increases in crop productivity achieved by reallocating manure to less fertile fields were short-lived on sandy soils. Preventing degradation of the soils under intensive cultivation is difficult, particularly in low input farming systems, and attention should be paid to judicious use of the limited nutrient resources to maintain a degree of soil fertility that supports good crop response to fertilizer application.

TI  - Increased productivity through integrated soil fertility management in cassava-legume intercropping systems in the highlands of {Sud}-{Kivu}, {DR} {Congo
VL  - 120
SN  - NA
AB  - Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are confronted by low productivity and limited investment capacity in nutrient inputs. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) aims at increased productivity through the combined use of improved germplasm, judicious fertilizer application and organic matter management, adapted to the local farming conditions. We hypothesize that the application of these different ISFM components can result in significant increases in productivity and economic benefits of cassava-legume intercropping systems. Participatory demonstration trials were conducted in the highlands of Sud-Kivu, DR Congo with 12 farmer groups during 3 seasons. Treatments included the farmers' common practice (local common bean and cassava varieties, seed broadcast and manure addition) and sequentially added ISFM components: improved bean and cassava germplasm, modified crop arrangements, compound NPK fertilizer application and alternative legume species (groundnut or soybean). The use of improved germplasm did not result in yield increases without simultaneous implementation of other ISFM components. Modifying the crop arrangement by planting cassava at 2m between rows and 0.5m within the row, intercropped with four legume lines, increased bean yields during the first season and permits a second bean intercrop, which can increase total legume production by up to 1tha-1 and result in an additional revenue of almost 1000USDha-1. Crop arrangement or a second legume intercrop did not affect cassava storage root yields. Fertilizer application increased both legume and cassava yield, and net revenue by 400-700USDha-1 with a marginal rate of return of 1.6-2.7. Replacing the common bean intercrop by groundnut increased net revenue by 200-400USDha-1 partly because of the higher market value of the grains, but mostly due to a positive effect on cassava storage root yield. Soybean affected cassava yields negatively because of its high biomass production and long maturity period; modifications are needed to integrate a soybean intercrop into the system. The findings demonstrate the large potential of ISFM to increase productivity in cassava-legume systems in the Central-African highlands. Benefits were, however, not observed in all study sites. In poor soils, productivity increases were variable or absent, and soil amendments are required. A better understanding of the conditions under which positive effects occur can enable better targeting and local adaptation of the technologies. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Chemical fertilizer reduction and soil fertility maintenance in rice-fish coculture system
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - In the long run, whether the use of chemical fertilizers could be reduced and soil fertility could be maintained through rice-fish coculture is less well known. At the pilot site of the rice-fish coculture system, which is one of the five "globally important agricultural heritage systems" (GIAHS), we conducted a 4-year study to compare fertilizer use, rice yield, and soil fertility in rice-fish coculture and rice monoculture. Based on the survey data from 21 villages, rice yield did not differ between rice monoculture and rice-fish coculture, but less chemical fertilizers were used in rice-fish coculture than in rice monoculture. Survey data from 145 farms also showed that rice-fish coculture farms with high input of feed for fish used less chemical fertilizers for rice production than farms with low input of feed for fish. In the 4-year field experiment, although less fertilizer was used in rice-fish coculture, rice yield, soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, and soluble phosphorus did not differ between rice-fish coculture and rice monoculture. Our results suggest that rice-fish coculture can reduce chemical fertilizers application, enhance land productivity, and maintain soil fertility. Our results also suggest that rice-fish coculture could reduce the risk of non-point source pollution by reducing the input of chemical fertilizers.

TI  - Soil fertility evaluation of coffee (coffea spp.) production systems and management recommendations for the {Barahona} {Province}, {Dominican} {Republic
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Reported yields in most coffee farms of the Barahona province in the Dominican Republic are relatively low ({\textless} 290 kg ha-1 parchment coffee). In general, coffee producers do not use diagnostic techniques such as soil testing. This fact prevents them from identifying the limiting factors (especially nutrients), complicates the work of coffee cultural management practices, and potentially reduces productivity and coffee quality. This study was designed to diagnose the fertility level of soils in coffee farms in the area of Barahona in 96 farms within an area of 637 hectares and design a nutrient management strategy. Soils from each farm were sampled and analyzed for soil fertility parameters. A survey was provided to farmers that permitted the collection of information regarding yields, management practices, and landscape features. Soils in the area were predominantly clayey. Soil pH varied between 4.61 and 7.69 and soil organic matter ranged between 3.29 and 10.9\%. Exchangeable potassium levels were classified as deficient in all areas. The clustering of results identified two main components, which accounted for 76\% of the variability of the data and the grouping into five communities by similarity of features. The results show that soil testing of this coffee coffee-growing region can be used as a tool to diagnose the soil fertility status and guide them in implementing management and fertilization recommendations.

TI  - Agronomic use efficiency of {N} fertilizer in maize-based systems in sub-{Saharan} {Africa} within the context of integrated soil fertility management
VL  - 339
SN  - NA
AB  - Traditionally, crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) depends primarily on mining soil nutrients. Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) is an approach for intensifying agriculture in SSA that aims at maximizing the agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied nutrient inputs. ISFM contains the following essential components: proper fertilizer management, use of improved varieties, the combined application of organic inputs and fertilizer, and adaptation of input application rates to within-farm soil fertility gradients where these are important. This paper evaluates, through meta-analysis, the impact of these components on the AE of fertilizer N (N-AE), defined as extra grain yield per kg fertilizer N applied, in maize-based systems in SSA. Since N-AE is low for excessive fertilizer N application rates or when fertilizer is applied on fertile, unresponsive soil, as was confirmed by scatter plots against control yields and fertilizer N application rates, such values were removed from the database in order to focus on and elucidate the more variable and complex responses under less than ideal conditions typical for SSA. Compared with local varieties, the use of hybrid maize varieties significantly increased N-AE values (17 and 26 kg (kg N)-1, respectively) with no differences observed between local and improved, open-pollinated varieties. Mixing fertilizer with manure or compost resulted in the highest N-AE values [36 kg (kg N)-1] while organic inputs of medium quality also showed significantly higher N-AE values compared with the sole fertilizer treatment but only at low organic input application rates (40 and 23 kg (kg N)-1, respectively). High quality organic inputs (Class I) and those with a high C-to-N ratio (Class III) or high lignin content (Class IV) did not affect N-AE values in comparison with the sole fertilizer treatment. Application of N fertilizer on infields resulted in significantly higher N-AE values [31 kg (kg N)-1] compared with the outfields [17 kg (kg N)-1]. The obtained information indicates that N-AE is amenable to improved management practices and that the various components embedded in the ISFM definition result in improvements in N-AE.

AB  - This study analyzed the relationships between soil nutrient characters and remote sensing image of the farmland in the Phaeozem region of Northeast China by GIS and canonical correlation analysis. The results showed that the two sets of variables, i.e. remote sensing indices and soil nutrient indices, had significantly correlative relationship (P{\textless}0.05) and the first canonical variable of remote sensing indices (W1) was significantly correlated with the first canonical variable of soil nutrient properties (V1) (r=0.72). In other words, it was a feasible and efficient way to estimate soil fertilizer level by analyzing remote sensing indices. SDI (SWIR Difference Index) dominated W1 and V1 was directly irifluenced by SOC, nitrogen, potassium and coarse sand At the same time, it indicated that SDI had significant relationship with SOC and total N, and SDI was the best index among all the remote sensing indices for evaluating soil nutrient status.

VL  - 90
SN  - NA
AB  - This study quantifies soil nutrient balances of Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture Systems in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Eleven farms were monitored to collect data on farm activities and nutrient inputs and outputs to compute these balances of the rice-based and high input fish system in O Mon district (R-HF); the rice-based and medium input fish system in Tam Binh district (R-MF); and the orchard-based and low input fish system in Cai Be district (O-LF). For the estimation, the Nutmon model has been adapted to the specific conditions in these integrated systems in Asia (Nutmon-Asia). New regression models of leaching and gaseous losses of nitrogen were applied to fields used for upland crops and paddy rice. Reference values were used for the assessment of nitrogen fixation in paddy soils, wet atmospheric deposition, and irrigation water. The results showed that farms in all three systems have nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium surpluses (84 kg N, 73 kg P, and 69 kg K ha-1 year-1). The O-LF system had the smallest nitrogen surplus while the smallest surplus of phosphorus and potassium was seen in the R-HF system. High surpluses of phosphorus and potassium were found in vegetable fields, whereas a negative potassium balance was found in the rice fields of all three systems. The positive farm nutrient balances indicate that it is likely that soil fertility will be maintained although there is a risk for environmental contamination. Â© 2010 The Author(s).

TI  - Soil phosphorus distribution as affected by irrigation methods in plastic film house
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Water-saving irrigation methods have been increasingly used for vegetable cultivation in greenhouse or plastic film house. However, there is limited information concerning the effect of water-saving irrigation methods on soil phosphorus (P) behavior. In this experiment, drip and subsurface irrigation methods were applied, with furrow irrigation method as control, in Mollic Gleysols. Soil P distribution throughout the depth was significantly affected by irrigation methods. Total, Olsen, organic and inorganic P contents were greater in the topsoil (0-10 and 10-20 cm) than in the subsoil (20-30, 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60 cm). The Olsen P content throughout 0-60 cm layer under drip and subsurface irrigation treatments was lower than that under the furrow irrigation treatment. However, the total, organic and inorganic P contents from 20 to 60 cm under drip irrigation treatment were higher than or close to those under furrow irrigation treatment, but were lower under subsurface irrigation treatment than under furrow irrigation treatment. Under subsurface irrigation treatment, the contents of total, organic and inorganic P at the 0-10 cm layer were 78.0\%, 1.3\% and 3.7\% greater than those at the 10-20 cm layer, respectively. But Olsen P content at the 10-20 cm layer was 5.7\% larger than that at the 0-10 cm layer. These suggested that soil P behavior could be manipulated by soil water management to some extent.

TI  - Estimating soil water content from surface digital image gray level measurements under visible spectrum
VL  - 91
SN  - NA
AB  - Determining soil water content (SWC) is fundamental for soil science, ecology and hydrology. Many methods are put forward to measure SWC, such as drying soil samples, neutron probes, time domain reflectrometry (TDR) and remote sensing. Sampling and drying soil is time-consuming. A neutron probe cannot determine SWC of surface soil accurately because neutrons escape when they are emitted near soil surface and TDR is, to some extent, influenced by soil salinity and temperature. Remote sensing can obtain SWC over a large area across a range of temporal and spatial scales. Complicated terrain and atmospheric conditions often make remote sensing data unreliable. Determining SWC from surface gray level (GL) measurements in the visible spectrum may have advantages over other remote sensing techniques, because surface soil images can be easily acquired by digital cameras, even with complicated landforms and meteorological conditions. However, few studies use this method, and further work is required to develop the ability of visible spectrum digital images to accurately estimate SWC. In this study, 42 soil samples were collected to investigate the relationship between surface GL and SWC using computer processing of soil surface images acquired by a digital camera. After establishing an equation to describe this relationship, a simple calibrated model was developed. The calibrated model was validated by an independent set of 48 soil samples. The results indicate that surface GL was sensitive to SWC. There was a negative linear relationship between surface GL and the square of SWC for the 42 calibration soil samples (correlation coefficients {\textgreater}0.91). Based on this negative relationship, a model was established to estimate SWC from surface GL. The results of model validation showed the estimated SWCs by surface GL were very close to the measured SWCs (correlation coefficient =0.99 at a significant level of 0.01). Generally, SWC could be estimated from surface GL for a given soil, and the model could be used to quickly and accurately determineg SWC from surface GL measurements.

VL  - 83
SN  - NA
AB  - Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) is a traditional economic tree species in China, and often cultivated in agroforestry systems. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of different Ginkgo and crop species combinations on soil fertility. We established two Ginkgo and crop species systems: Ginkgo + wheat + soybean (G+W+S), Ginkgo + rape + soybean (G+R+S), and one Ginkgo + mulberry (G+M) system, one pure mulberry plantation (M), and one crop systems of rape + soybean (R+S) in the field. Soil chemical properties and enzymes activities were measured 4 years after planting. These soil chemical properties and enzyme activities were used as soil fertility indicators (FI). Soil fertility of the five planting systems was finally evaluated by using improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The result showed that soil chemical properties (including pH, organic matter, total N, hydrolysable N, available P and K, total K) and soil enzyme activities (including catalase, sucrase, urease, dehydrogenase, phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase and protease) in the five planting systems were significantly different from each other (P = 0.0237). The above parameters were also different at different soil depths. The concentration of total N, P, organic matter, available P and K of soil decreased significantly with soil depth (P = 0.0146), however, pH increased. The concentrations of organic matter, total N, hydrolysable N, available P and K of soil under rape + soybean (R+S) was lowest among the five planting systems. The activities of sucrase, urease, dehydrogenase, phosphatase and protease decreased with soil depth, however, the activity of catalase and polyphenol oxidase increased. Except for catalase, the activities of these enzymes in the R+S system were the lowest among the five planting systems. The integrated evaluation of soil fertility showed that soil fertility indicators (FI) were significantly different, and the FI values for the five systems followed order: G+M (0.847) {\textgreater} G+W+S (0.446) {\textgreater} M (0.399) {\textgreater} G+R+S (0.343) {\textgreater} R+S (0.211). These results indicated that adoption of a Ginkgo-crop combination could lead to increased long-term sustainability of soil fertility by improving levels of soil organic matter, pH, available nutrient and soil enzyme activity.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - The goal of this study was calibration of the ECH2O soil moisture sensor EC-5 and the sensor SM200 for selected soils of the Czech Republic. Based on the soil maps of the Czech Republic and various climatic conditions, five humic horizons of different soil types were selected: Stagnic Chernozem Siltic, Haplic Chernozem, Chernozem Arenic, Haplic Luvisol, and Haplic Cambisol. Soil properties (pHKCl, pHH2O, exchangeable acidity, cation exchange capacity, hydrolytic acidity, basic cation saturation, sorption complex saturation, oxidable organic carbon content, CaCO3 content, salinity, sand, silt, and clay content, soil particle density, bulk density) were determined using the standard laboratory techniques. Six ECH 2O EC-5 sensors permanently installed in six 606 cm3 repacked soil samples of each soil were calibrated. Four calibrated SM200 sensors were inserted into the same soil samples only when measuring sensor signal. Soil water contents were determined gravimetrically. Linear equation was used to find parameters of the calibration equations relating sensor signals or evaluated dielectric constants and soil water contents. The multiple linear analyses showed that the parameters of the calibration equations for the EC-5 depended on the bulk density, fraction of sand particles, and salinity. Parameters a and b of the SM200 depended on the initial soil salinity, sand fraction and CaCO3 content, and on the sand fraction, respectively. The impact of KBr solute (concentrations of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1M Br) on calibration equations was studied as well. It was found that ECH2O EC-5 sensor measurements were more influenced by KBr solution than SM200 measurements. In the case of the ECH2O EC-5 sensor, impact of KBr was lower in soils of higher initial salinity. SM200 measurements were noticeably influenced only when 0.1M Br solution was applied.

TI  - Assessing soil nitrogen availability in contrasting cropping systems at the end of transition to organic production
VL  - 91
SN  - NA
AB  - Quantifying soil nitrogen (N) availability at the end of a transition period for converting conventional fields to organic fields could enhance N management during the subsequent organic crop production phase. Soil total N (Ntot), KCl extractable N (KCl N) and potentially mineralizable N (No) were determined at the end of a 3-yr transition period. A complementary greenhouse ryegrass N bioassay was conducted using soils collected from the treated field plots. The field experiment consisted of six cropping systems comprising two N inputs (legume-based vs. manure-based) and three forage cropping treatments (0, 1 or 2 yr of forage in 4-yr rotations). The N input treatments consisted of alfalfa meal in the legume-based cropping system (LBCS) and composted beef manure in the manure-based cropping system (MBCS). Orthogonal contrasts suggested no differences in Ntot or KCl N either between LBCS and MBCS or between no-forage and forage cropping systems. However, in the greenhouse study, high cumulative N inputs in the MBCS resulted in significantly higher ryegrass N uptake and potentially mineralizable soil N than in the LBCS. Ryegrass N uptake ranged from 101 to 139 kg ha-1, which should be an adequate N supply for the succeeding potato crop. In the greenhouse, a ryegrass N bioassay effectively identified the differences in soil N availability. Ryegrass N uptake was linearly related to cumulative soil amendment N inputs but had no apparent relationship with No. A systems approach provided a good assessment of N availability at the end of the transition period to organic production.

TI  - Mineralizable soil nitrogen and labile soil organic matter in diverse long-term cropping systems
VL  - 90
SN  - NA
AB  - Sustainable soil fertility management depends on long-term integrated strategies that build and maintain soil organic matter and mineralizable soil N levels. These strategies increase the portion of crop N needs met by soil N and reduce dependence on external N inputs required for crop production. To better understand the impact of management on soil N dynamics, we conducted field and laboratory research on five diverse management systems at a long-term study in Maryland, the USDA- Agricultural Research Service Beltsville Farming Systems Project (FSP). The FSP is comprised of a conventional no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/double-crop soybean rotation (NT), a conventional chisel-till corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (CT), a 2 year organic corn-soybean rotation (Org2), a 3 year organic corn-soybean-wheat rotation (Org3), and a 6 year organic corn-soybean-wheat-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (3 years) rotation (Org6). We found that total potentially mineralizable N in organic systems (average 315 kg N ha-1) was significantly greater than the conventional systems (average 235 kg N ha-1). Particulate organic matter (POM)-C and -N also tended to be greater in organic than conventional cropping systems. Average corn yield and N uptake from unamended (minus N) field microplots were 40 and 48\%, respectively, greater in organic than conventional grain cropping systems. Among the three organic systems, all measures of N availability tended to increase with increasing frequency of manure application and crop rotation length (Org2 {\textless} Org3 â‰¤ Org6) while most measures were similar between NT and CT. Our results demonstrate that organic soil fertility management increases soil N availability by increasing labile soil organic matter. Relatively high levels of mineralizable soil N must be considered when developing soil fertility management plans for organic systems. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (outside the USA).

VL  - 42
SN  - NA
AB  - An estimate of total potassium (K) contents of soils is required to assess the difficultly available fractions of soil potassium. Three digestion procedures were evaluated in terms of recovery of elemental K, precision, and simplicity in combination with analysis of K contents by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in soils derived from contrasting parent materials. A hydrofluoric acid-perchloric acid (HClO4)-nitric acid (HNO3) mixture extracted the most K from 10 soils studied (4809.9 mg kg-1) followed by aqua regia (3180.89 mg kg-1) and HClO4-HNO3 mixtures (1206.75 mg kg-1). On average, aqua regia and HClO4-HNO3 digestion methods extracted 66.1\% and 25.1\% of the K extracted with the HF-HClO4-HNO3 mixture, respectively. Precision analysis as percentage of relative standard deviation showed excellent precision ({\textless}5\%) for the HF-HClO4-HNO3 method (1.49\%) compared to the HClO4-HNO3 mixture (10.72\%). The present study concludes that the HF-HClO4-HNO3 digestion mixture is superior over both aqua regia and HClO4-HNO3 mixtures for total K estimation in the soils of Central Highland provinces of Papua New Guinea especially when ICP-OES is employed for analysis.

TI  - Field calibrations of soil moisture sensors in a forested watershed
VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatially variable soil properties influence the performance of soil water content monitoring sensors. The objectives of this research were to: (i) study the spatial variability of bulk density (Ïb), total porosity (Î¸t), clay content (CC), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH in the upper MÄkaha Valley watershed soils; (ii) explore the effect of variations in Ïb and Î¸t on soil water content dynamics, and (iii) establish field calibration equations for EC-20 (Decagon Devices, Inc), ML2x (Delta-T-Devices), and SM200 (Delta-T-Devices) sensors to mitigate the effect of soil spatial variability on their performance. The studied soil properties except pH varied significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) across the soil water content monitoring depths (20 and 80 cm) and six locations. There was a linear positive and a linear inverse correlation between the soil water content at sampling and Ïb, and between the soil water content at sampling and Î¸t, respectively. Values of laboratory measured actual Î¸t correlated (r = 0.75) with those estimated from the relationship Î¸t = 1 - Ïb/Ïs, where Ïs is the particle density. Variations in the studied soil properties affected the performance of the default equations of the three tested sensors; they showed substantial under-estimations of the actual water content. The individual and the watershed-scale field calibrations were more accurate than their corresponding default calibrations. In conclusion, the sensors used in this study need site-specific calibrations in order to mitigate the effects of varying properties of the highly weathered tropical soils.

TI  - Monitoring surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw state with the high-resolution radar of the {Soil} {Moisture} {Active}/{Passive} ({SMAP}) mission
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - An approach is described for retrieving surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state using 3-km resolution L-band radar data of the planned Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission. SMAP radar backscatter coefficients are simulated using radar scattering models and land surface hydrology model output generated over the contiguous United States (CONUS). A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to assess the error budget of the soil moisture retrievals in the presence of radar measurement error and error in surface roughness. The estimated soil moisture retrieval accuracy is better than 0.06 cm3/cm3 for vegetation water content less than 1.2 kg/m2 and soil moisture in the range of 0 to 0.3 cm 3/cm3. The retrieval performance improves if radar speckle is reduced by additional observations (e.g., including both fore- and aft-scan data). It is currently assumed that the surface roughness is known with 10\% error, but a time-series method is under development to estimate the roughness. The surface freeze/thaw state retrieval is simulated using a surface hydrology process model forced with climatology. The simulation illustrates a SMAP daily composite freeze/thaw product derived using a time-series algorithm applied to the SMAP high-resolution radar data. Â© 2010 IEEE.

VL  - 41
SN  - NA
AB  - A field experiment was conducted for 2 years on a clayey Vertisol to compare the organic and conventional methods of rice farming. Two main plot treatments were with and without plant protection and four subplot treatments were (1) control (CON); (2) inorganic fertilizers (CF); (3) organics (OF), and (4) inorganics + organics (integrated nutrient management, INM). The organics were green manure, paddy straw, and poultry manure. After 2 years, the main plot effects were not significant in terms of crop productivity though there was a reduction in soil biological parameters. Increase in grain yield was larger with inorganics and INM as compared to the organics because of the higher panicle number. However, organics increased the microbial populations, biomass carbon, nitrogen, enzyme activities, and soil fertility as compared to inorganics. Thus, organics improved the nutrient availability by influencing the soil biological activity although it did not reflect in greater yields. Â© Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - Our objective is to describe and evaluate the spatial variability of the surface soil moisture at small scales using Radarsat-2 images acquired over an agricultural area. To reach this aim, a geostatistical analysis is applied to up scale the soil moisture from ground measurements to the resolution of radar images and also from retrieving soil moisture at different spatial resolution. To conduct this study, four RADARSAT-2 images acquired at different modes during the summer of 2008 over agriculture fields located in Saskatoon (Saskatchewan, Canada) were used. The available data are ground measurements of soil moisture, surface roughness and vegetation characteristics. The comparison between retrieval and ground soil moisture showed average absolute relative errors of about 35\% and 55\% for fine and ScanSAR mode images respectively. Indeed, a weak amelioration was obtained from the up scaling of the ground soil moisture data to the spatial scale of the different radar image. Â©2009 IEEE.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of soil moisture using {ENVISAT}-{ASAR} images: {A} case study in suburban region of {Peking}, {China
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a highly variable component of soil, and plays an important role in materials and energy exchanges between earth and atmosphere. It is also the basic parameter of crop growing and crop yield forecast. With the features of observing large area synchronously, timely, and economically, remote sensing technique makes dynamic soil moisture monitoring possible. Soil moisture remote sensing monitoring has 30 years history and many researches have been done home and abroad in this field, including visible and infrared remote sensing based NDVI methods, hyper spectral remote sensing based algorithm, and microwave remote sensing orientated methodology and so on. Among these methods, microwave has great advantage in retrieval soil moisture because of the characteristics of all-weather, penetrability and not affected by the cloud. Through study people found that microwave is one of the most effective methods in retrieval soil moisture in various technologies. This paper summarizes the major microwave sensors and the principle of microwave remote sensing, and introduces the microwave model and soil moisture algorithm. Based on ENVISAT Radar data, with suburban farmland (wheat and corn as the main crop) of Peking as the study area, we established the microwave scattering characteristics database of local exposed surface. We used the selected model to simulate the response characteristics of backscattering coefficient influenced by a variety of parameters, such as soil moisture, surface roughness, incidence angle, polarization, etc. Then we got the updated inversion empirical model of the exposed surface, and evaluated the accuracy of model with the actually surveyed data in the field. This article makes certain contributions to the active microwave soil moisture retrieval methods study, and provide a viable model for water resources decision-making support to the Peking municipal government.

TI  - Soil moisture measurements: {Comparison} of instrumentation performances
VL  - 136
SN  - NA
AB  - It has long been recognized that reliable, robust, and automated instrumentation for the measurement of soil moisture content can be extremely useful, if not essential, in hydrological, environmental, and agricultural applications. A number of automated techniques for point measurement of soil water content have been developed to operational level over the past few decades. While each of those techniques has been individually calibrated by the gravimetric method, typically under laboratory conditions, there have been few studies that made a direct comparison between the various techniques, particularly under field conditions. This paper compares ECH2O probes, EC-5 (both sensors based on capacitance measurements, developed by Decagon Devices) and time domain reflectometer sensors (CS616 Campbell Scientific Water Content Reflectometer), with gravimetric data and with each other, under field conditions. Data were collected during two field experiments characterized by different soils and a wide range of soil moistures, resulting from irrigation/drying cycle. Results show that all the tested probes give acceptable results after being calibrated in the field. The capacitive sensors can be used in each type of soil with the same calibration equation, independently from depth, with root mean square error (RMSE) ranging between 2.5 and 3.6\%. Time Domain Reflectometry probes showed a dependence on depth but a lower RMSE (1.6\%). Â© 2010 ASCE.

TI  - The diversity of rural livelihoods and their influence on soil fertility in agricultural systems of {East} {Africa} - {A} typology of smallholder farms
VL  - 103
SN  - NA
AB  - Technological interventions to address the problem of poor productivity of smallholder agricultural systems must be designed to target socially diverse and spatially heterogeneous farms and farming systems. This paper proposes a categorisation of household diversity based on a functional typology of livelihood strategies, and analyses the influence of such diversity on current soil fertility status and spatial variability on a sample of 250 randomly selected farms from six districts of Kenya and Uganda. In spite of the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity observed across the region (e.g. 4 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency in Vihiga, Kenya vs. 10 in Tororo, Uganda) consistent patterns of variability were also observed. For example, all the households with less than 3 months year-1 of food self-sufficiency had a land:labour ratio (LLR) {\textless} 1, and all those with LLR {\textgreater} 1 produced enough food to cover their diet for at least 5 months. Households with LLR {\textless} 1 were also those who generated more than 50\% of their total income outside the farm. Dependence on off/non-farm income was one of the main factors associated with household diversity. Based on indicators of resource endowment and income strategies and using principal component analysis, farmers' rankings and cluster analysis the 250 households surveyed were grouped into five farm types: (1) Farms that rely mainly on permanent off-farm employment (from 10 to 28\% of the farmers interviewed, according to site); (2) larger, wealthier farms growing cash crops (8-20\%); (3) medium resource endowment, food self-sufficient farms (20-38\%); (4) medium to low resource endowment relying partly on non-farm activities (18-30\%); and (5) poor households with family members employed locally as agricultural labourers by wealthier farmers (13-25\%). Due to differential soil management over long periods of time, and to ample diversity in resource endowments (land, livestock, labour) and access to cash, the five farm types exhibited different soil carbon and nutrient stocks (e.g. Type 2 farms had average C, N, P and K stocks that were 2-3 times larger than for Types 4 or 5). In general, soil spatial variability was larger in farms (and sites) with poorer soils and smaller in farms owning livestock. The five farm types identified may be seen as domains to target technological innovations and/or development efforts. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters on soil moisture retrieval from passive microwave remote sensing
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable in the process of water and energy exchanges at the land surface. Passive microwave remote sensing techniques have great potential for its frequent coverage, low data rates, and simpler data processing, but with poor spatial resolution, which resulted in sub-pixel heterogeneity. To study the effect of spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters on the retrieval of soil moisture, HI and EI were defined as the description of parameter's sub-pixel heterogeneity and the error of soil moisture retrieval, respectively. This paper firstly simulated different sub-pixel heterogeneities of each parameter, which were used as the input of the radiative transfer (RT) model, and then compared the soil moisture results retrieved by taking heterogeneity into account with that neglected the heterogeneity, seeking the relationship between those parameters' heterogeneity and the error of soil moisture retrieval. Finally, the conclusion was validated by two exact field experiments based on a Truck-mounted Multi-frequency Microwave Radiometer (TMMR). It can be concluded that the RT model has enough accuracy to this study. The simulation analysis and field experiment reveals that there's a good relationship between the heterogeneity index and error index. The EI increased with HI grow up. However, the absolute error resulted by the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in bare soil is negligible. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring using hyper-spectral remote sensing technology
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Precision agriculture needs surface soil moisture information accurately and quickly. Hyper-spectral remote sensing can be used to detect slight differences in soil moisture because of high-resolution and multi-band in spectral. Taking black soil in Jilin Province of China as the research object, this paper analyzed soil hyper-spectral characteristics and extracted parameters by using methods of spectral differentiation, feature-band extraction and multiple stepwise regression analysis. The relationship between soil moisture and soil spectra was analyzed combining with soil moisture laboratory measurement. Five models were used to quantitative inversion in order to seek soil moisture monitoring by applying hyper-spectral remote sensing. The conclusion was as follows: in the below field water holding capacity condition, the sensitive bands of black soil spectral reflectance and its reciprocal and logarithmic transformation mainly focused in 400-470nm, 1950-2050nm and 2100-2200nm. The highest correlation coefficient between laboratory spectral data and soil moisture reached to 0. 89 at 2156nm; The best prediction model of black soil moisture content by using hyper-spectral remote sensing was Y = 22.16 + 26278.2x1328-47785.1x1439- 201.42x1742 + 49306.34x2156, x = (1gR)', Y representing soil moisture content (\%), coefficient of determination was 0. 931.

TI  - Sensitivity of capacitance soil moisture sensors to nitrate ions in soil solution
VL  - 74
SN  - NA
AB  - Capacitance type sensors have been widely used to monitor soil water content and salinity, but little is known about their response to specific ions in soil solution. The goal of this laboratory study was to investigate the sensitivity of two capacitance probes, ECH2O EC-5 and EC-10, to NO3 concentration in soil solutions, as well as to understand the differences in sensor response to the presence of other ions in the solutions. Forty-five uniformly packed soil samples were prepared using a homogenized loam soil wetted to five volumetric water contents (VWC) with nine solutions containing different concentrations of NO3-, Cl -, or both, A two-stage analysis of the normalized data revealed that ion type and concentration had a significant effect (P âˆ¼ 0.01) only for the response of the EC-10 probes operating at a frequency of 5 MHz. The response of the EC-5 probes, operating at 70 MHz, was mainly explained by changes in VWC. Multiple linear regression models fitted to the EC-10 response to individual solutions showed that concentration had a statistically significant predictive value only for samples wetted with NO3 solutions when temperature was incorporated in the model. The study confirmed that capacitance probes operating at a relatively low frequency of 5 MHz are more sensitive to changes in NO3 concentration than in Cl, We attributed this effect to the difference in ion mass that manifests through an increase in conductivity at ionspecific frequency. Additional experimental work is needed, however, to accurately define optimal frequencies for measuring ion-induced effects on dielectric measurement and to quantify interrelations between them.

TI  - Investigating the effects of soil moisture on thermal infrared land surface temperature and emissivity using satellite retrievals and laboratory measurements
VL  - 114
SN  - NA
AB  - This study investigates the effects of soil moisture (SM) on thermal infrared (TIR) land surface emissivity (LSE) using field- and satellite-measurements. Laboratory measurements were used to simulate the effects of rainfall and subsequent surface evaporation on the LSE for two different sand types. The results showed that the LSE returned to the dry equilibrium state within an hour after initial wetting, and during the drying process the SM changes were uncorrelated with changes in LSE. Satellite retrievals of LSE from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were examined for an anomalous rainfall event over the Namib Desert in Namibia during April, 2006. The results showed that increases in Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall estimates corresponded closely with LSE increases of between 0.08-0.3 at 8.6 Î¼m and up to 0.03 at 11 Î¼m for MODIS v4 and AIRS products. This dependence was lost in the more recent MODIS v5 product which artificially removed the correlation due to a stronger coupling with the split-window algorithm, and is lost in any algorithms that force the LSE to a pre-determined constant as in split-window type algorithms like those planned for use with the NPOESS Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Good agreement was found between MODIS land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) and day/night v4 algorithm (MOD11B1 v4), while the split-window dependent products (MOD11B1 v5 and MOD11A1) had cooler mean temperatures on the order of 1-2 K over the Namib Desert for the month of April 2006.

TI  - Characterization of soil water content variability and soil texture using {GPR} groundwave techniques
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate characterization of near-surface soil water content is vital for guiding agricultural management decisions and for reducing the potential negative environmental impacts of agriculture. Characterizing the near-surface soil water content can be difficult, as this parameter is often both spatially and temporally variable, and obtaining sufficient measurements to describe the heterogeneity can be prohibitively expensive. Understanding the spatial correlation of near-surface soil water content can help optimize data acquisition and improve understanding of the processes controlling soil water content at the field scale. In this study, ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods were used to characterize the spatial correlation of water content in a three acre field as a function of sampling depth, season, vegetation, and soil texture. GPR data were acquired with 450 MHz and 900 MHz antennas, and measurements of the GPR groundwave were used to estimate soil water content at four different times. Additional water content estimates were obtained using time domain reflectometry measurements, and soil texture measurements were also acquired. Variograms were calculated for each set of measurements, and comparison of these variograms showed that the horizontal spatial correlation was greater for deeper water content measurements than for shallower measurements. Precipitation and irrigation were both shown to increase the spatial variability of water content, while shallowly-rooted vegetation decreased the variability. Comparison of the variograms of water content and soil texture showed that soil texture generally had greater small-scale spatial correlation than water content, and that the variability of water content in deeper soil layers was more closely correlated to soil texture than were shallower water content measurements. Lastly, cross-variograms of soil texture and water content were calculated, and co-kriging of water content estimates and soil texture measurements showed that geophysically-derived estimates of soil water content could be used to improve spatial estimation of soil texture.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of electromagnetic geophysical methods for estimating soil moisture content. In this study, electromagnetic induction (EMI) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were coincidently collected along a fixed survey line to evaluate temporal changes in apparent electrical conductivity and electromagnetic direct ground wave velocity, respectively; surveys were collected at three sites (i.e., sand, sandy loam and silt loam) during the course of a complete annual cycle of soil conditions. These two geophysical data sets correlated well during the course of the annual cycle at the silt loam site. Correlation between the two data sets was not as strong at the other two sites, with the sand site showing the lowest correlation values. Further, the geophysical data and gravimetric water content measurements obtained from the upper 0.5 metres indicate higher correlation estimates at the finer grained silt loam site relative to the sand and sandy loam sites.

AB  - Fusion image of SAR (Radar-sat image) combined with visible spectrum remote sensing image (TM image) is used to extract soil and vegetation water content in arid oasis taking the delta oasis of Weigan and Kuqa rivers in Xinjiang as the study area. Based on the Normalized Difference Moisture Index extracted from homochromous visible spectrum remote sensing data, this thesis utilizes "water-cloud model" to wipe off vegetation influence from total backscattering coefficient of radar data and sets up the relationship between soil backscattering coefficient and soil moisture. The Result shows that in arid and semi-arid area where the main crops are cotton and corn, the combination of C-band HH polarization radar data with visible image performs well in the study of removing vegetation influence while retrieving soil water content in medium vegetated areas.

VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - A long term profile soil moisture data acquisition effort is currently under way at 12 monitoring stations across southwestern France. The spatial distribution and set-up of those sites was specifically designed for validating remote sensing and model soil moisture estimates [1], [2]. Those m-situ measurements are used to test a simple method to retrieve root zone soil moisture from a time series of surface soil moisture information. A recursive exponential filter using a time constant, T, is used to compute a profile soil water index from the surface observations. Through optimisation, a unique value for T of 6 days is found to result in a satisfactory correlation between observation and estimate for all stations. The surface soil moisture observed is also used to evaluate the normalized surface soil moisture estimates derived from coarse resolution (25 km) active microwave data of the ASCAT C-band. For 11 stations, significant correlation levels are found. The best correlation between a soil water index derived from ASCAT and the in-situ observations is obtained for a T of 14 days. Â©2009 IEEE.

TI  - Economic analysis of different options in integrated pest and soil fertility management in maize systems of {Western} {Kenya
VL  - 41
SN  - NA
AB  - The major biotic constraints to the production of maize, the major staple food in Western Kenya, are field pests such as Striga and stem borers, and low soil fertility. To counter these constraints, new cropping systems have been developed, including " push-pull," rotations with promiscuous soybean varieties and green manure crops, and imidazolinone resistant- (IR-) maize. To analyze the technical and economic performance of these technologies, both with and without fertilizer, on-farm researcher-managed long-term trials were implemented over six seasons in two sites each in Vihiga and Siaya districts of Western Kenya. The economic results, based on marginal analysis using a multioutput, multiperiod model, show that the new cropping systems with fodder intercropping (push-pull) or soybean rotations were highly profitable. Push-pull is more profitable but requires a relatively high initial investment cost. Green manure rotation, IR-maize, and fertilizer all increased yields, but these investments were generally not justified by their increased revenue. We argue that research on rotation and cropping systems to tackle pest and soil fertility problems in Africa deserve more attention. This will require increased collaboration between agronomists and economists to set up long-term experiments with new cropping systems to develop proper economic models.

SN  - NA
AB  - The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission directly responds to the current lack of global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, which are needed to improve meteorological and climatic predictions. The mission will produce measurements of brightness temperature by using an innovative Microwave Image Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis at L-Band (MIRAS). The objective of this paper is to assess the possibility to have an operative long term monitoring of the instrument calibration in the SMOS ground segment, by observing large areas of the Earth surface characterized by a stable emissivity at L-band, with slight variations, when compared with the radiometric accuracy of MIRAS. To this aim, C band signatures collected by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) over the Brazilian rain forest and ERS-2 Scatterometer data over Antarctica have been analyzed, in order to select areas with the best spatial and temporal stability. Extrapolations to L-band have been obtained by using model simulations for the Amazon case and experimental data available in the literature for Antarctica. An operational procedure to monitor the selected areas has been defined to be implemented in the SMOS ground segment.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval with remote sensing images for debris flow forecast in humid regions
VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter in debris flow prediction for its influence on the critical rainfall triggering debris flow. Soil moisture can be obtained by ground measurement. However, it is difficult to extend these limited observing data to the regional scale because of the heterogeneity of land surface. The Temperature- Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) is a common method of estimating regional soil moisture by the images of MODIS, because of its moderate spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. However, because the basic assumption of the TVDI method is that pixels from the study region can cover the entire range of soil moisture conditions and vegetation fractions, it is difficult to determine the actual dry edge of the space in humid regions. The Crop Water Shortage Index (CWSI) calculated by actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration does not need fitting to the dry edge and wet edge. CWSI further considers about the influence of vegetation. In this paper, we applied both TVDI and CWSI methods to retrieving soil moisture using remote sensing and meteorological data in Zhejiang Province, which has a humid climate. Among CWSI, the actual and potential evapotranspiration are calculated by the SEBS model. CWSI can also directly express the extent of soil moisture. In surface soil (0-10cm), the correlation coefficient of CWSI and measured relative soil moisture (RSM) reached -0.89. Â© 2010 WIT Press.

TI  - Evaluation of a soil moisture data assimilation system over {WEST} {AFRICA
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) is responsible for providing monthly global crop estimates that heavily influence global commodity market access. These estimates are derived from a merging of many data sources including satellite and ground observations, and more than 20 years of climatology and crop behavior data over key agricultural areas. The goal of IPAD is to provide timely and accurate estimates of global crop conditions for use in up-to-date commodity intelligence reports. A crucial requirement of these global crop yield forecasts is the regional characterization of surface and sub-surface soil moisture. However, due to the spatial heterogeneity and dynamic nature of precipitation events and soil wetness, accurate estimation of regional land surface-atmosphere interactions based sparse ground measurements is difficult [1]. Temporal resolution is particularly important for predicting adequate surface wetting and drying between precipitation events and is closely integrated with CADRE. We attempt to improve upon the existing system by applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA soil moisture model. The improved temporal resolution and spatial coverage of the satellite-based EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) is envisaged to provide a better characterization of root zone soil moisture at the regional scale and enable more accurate crop monitoring in key agricultural areas This work aims at evaluating the utility of merging satelliteretrieved soil moisture estimates with the IPAD two-layer soil moisture model used within the DBMS. We present a quantitative analysis of the assimilated soil moisture product over West Africa (9Â° N-20Â° N; 20Â° W-20Â° E). This region contains many key agricultural areas and has a high agro-meteorological gradient from desert and semi-arid vegetation in the North, to grassland, trees and crops in the South, thus providing an ideal location for evaluating the assimilated soil moisture product over multiple land cover types and conditions. A data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely-sensed soil moisture by comparing assimilated soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) lowquality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA rootzone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.

TI  - Abundance and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species in long-term soil fertility management systems in {Northern} {Nigeria
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility management systems (SFMS) can influence the community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Hence, long-term SFMS was studied. The SFMS comprised three legume combinations, urea application and solely maize as control. Spores were extracted by wet sieving, characterized and identified using their morphology. Interrelationships between cropping systems and occurrence of AMF species were analyzed with genotype by environment (GGE) biplot. Seventeen species were identified with Glomus species (47.05\%) having highest value while Gigaspora species had the least (11.76\%). Legume residues significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased spore population with the highest spore count (120 spores/100 g soil) obtained in plot under cowpea residue. Shannon Weiner index (Hâ€²) of maize/Lablab purpureus plot was highest (1.996) while that of sole maize system was the least (1.550). The GGE indicated Glomus intraradices as a stable species across all the SFMS. Community structure of AMF and function can be preserved using appropriate SFMS. Â© Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - A real-time drought monitoring method: {Cropland} soil moisture index ({CSMI}) and application
VL  - 7472
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil Moisture and Vegetation Growth are the most important and direct index in drought monitoring, and the spectrum interpretation of vegetation and soil are serious factors in the judgment of drought degree. To find a more real-time monitoring index of cropland soil moisture by remote sensing, a Cropland Soil Moisture Index (CSMI) was established in this paper based on the effective reflections of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on deeper soil moisture and well expressions of Surface Water Content Index (SWCI) on surface soil moisture. By validation with different time-series MODIS data, the Cropland Soil Moisture Index (CSMI) not only overcome the limitation of hysteretic nature and saturated quickly of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), but also take the advantage of the Surface Water Content Index (SWCI) which effectively reduce the atmosphere disturbance and retrieval surface soil water content better. The index passed the significant F-tests with Î± = 0. 01, and is a true real-time drought monitoring index. Â© 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Effects of long-term fertilization and mulch on soil fertility in contour hedgerow systems: {A} case study on steeplands from the {Three} {Gorges} {Area}, {China
VL  - 84
SN  - NA
AB  - The use of contour hedgerows is widely advocated to sustain crop production and reduce soil loss on steeplands in the Three Gorges Area of China. However, little is known about the effects of soil management on soil fertility within these systems, or about the spatial gradients in soil nutrients that may develop in terraces formed behind the vegetative barriers. Therefore, we carried out a study on the effects of various long-term soil management practices on soil fertility and spatial variation of fertility between hedgerows. At a site in the Three Gorges Area, China, we applied five treatments to a contour hedgerow system: control (no fertilizer and manure); chemical fertilizer (CF); chemical fertilizer and mulch (CF + MU); pig manure (PM); and mulch, pig manure, and chemical fertilizer (CF + PM + MU). Soil samples were collected from the topsoil horizon (0-20 cm) of the selected five treatments in 2006 after 11 crop cycles, and physical and chemical properties were analyzed. The results showed that chemical fertilizer clearly improves nutrient status of the topsoil, while pig manure also increased the amount of soil organic matter. This increase in organic matter was associated with an increase in soil aggregate stability, a reduction in bulk density, and reduced penetration resistance of the soil. Mulch with pig manure and chemical fertilizer was the best management practice for improving soil quality and crop yields in the Three Gorges Area. Further, mulch and pig manure addition also decreased the magnitude of the spatial variation, but did not offset the soil fertility gradients because tillage resulted in significant movement of soil. More favorable soil properties were found at the lower positions within each alley, regardless of the management practice applied. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Calibration and simultaneous monitoring of soil water content and salinity with capacitance and four-electrode probes
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - Non-destructive monitoring of soil water content (W) and the electrical conductivity of the soil solution (ECw) has been desired for environmental evaluation and sustainable agriculture. Dielectric probes and four-electrode probes are widely used for the non-destructive determination of W and the soil bulk electrical conductivity (ECb), respectively. Since the output of dielectric probes is affected by soil salinity, the calibration for the effect is indispensable for accurate determination of W. Meanwhile, four-electrode probes require the W value for determination of ECw from ECb. We present an empirical calibration method for the salinity dependence of commercial capacitance moisture probes. A four-electrode probe was also calibrated to investigate the possibility of simultaneous monitoring of W and ECw by combining each calibration equation for capacitance and four-electrode probes. A laboratory experiment was conducted using a sandy soil to obtain probe outputs at various W (air-dry-near-saturation) and ECw (0-31.9 dS m-1). The output of the capacitance probe exhibited strong, nonlinear dependence on ECw. The root mean square error (RMSE) between actual W and calculated W using the linear functions provided by the manufacturer was at a maximum of 0.162 m3 m-3. A calibration equation, describing the probe output as a function of W and ECw, was developed using curve fitting approach. The RMSE between the actual and calibrated W by this equation was at a maximum of 0.011 m3 m-3. The output of the four-electrode probe (ECb) was also expressed as a function of W and ECw. The calibration equations for each probe were combined and solved for W and ECw. Although both W and ECw were determined with acceptable accuracy, the combined calibration equation had multiple solutions for W. Development of the method to select optimal solutions will be needed for the practical application of this probe combination. Â© 2008 Science Publications.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of soil nutrients influenced by an altered land tenure system in {China
VL  - 152
SN  - NA
AB  - Initiated during the late 1970s in China, the Household Responsibility System (HRS) has brought a profound change to the rural economy. The shift from a collective farming system to individually-owned family farms has changed land management practices, affecting both soil quality and agro-environmental sustainability. The purpose of this study was to investigate spatio-temporal variability of soil nutrients influenced by the altered land tenure system, and to evaluate the potential for site-specific management. Using geostatistics and GIS, we characterized the spatial variability of soil nutrients in paddy rice fields in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou watershed, China, following 20 years of altered land management policy. Soil samples, collected in 1982 and 2001, were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). The spatial variability of each of these soil properties decreased from 1982 to 2001, verifying that the extrinsic factors of the altered land management practices had a weakening effect on the intrinsic factors of soil formation properties. Spatial correlation ranges for SOM, TN, and AP in 2001 all decreased from 1982 with the exception of AK. Temporal geographic maps revealed significant changes in soil nutrient concentrations in the form of increases in SOM, TN, and AP and a sharp decline of AK during the period 1982-2001. This result gave an indication of the imbalance among N, P, and K fertilizers applied in the study area. The results of the comprehensive assessment for current soil nutrients could also, inversely, present challenges for future site-specific management policy on agriculture. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Group inversion approach for soil moisture characteristics estimation from multi-sensor data
VL  - 7109
SN  - NA
AB  - Sensor and ground measurements can be considered as different representation of soil moisture characteristics. Sensor measurements, i.e. radar acquisitions, are synoptic and can cover wide areas but are influenced by other parameters such as roughness and vegetation. On the other side ground measurements are more related to soil moisture but because of the large variability of soil moisture often require some interpolation techniques to be later compared to satellite data. This paper presents an approach denominated Group Inversion Approach which aims at detecting the stable soil moisture characteristics starting from all kind of measurements available. Being reliable these points can be subsequently used to infer information about the mean soil moisture content over an area, such as a whole watershed. The soil moisture estimated from different inversion approaches are compared among them and with the ground data in relation with field characteristics. In this preliminary analysis the field characteristics have been extracted by the SAR images considering their semi-variograms. The preliminary results indicate that those fields with lowest inversion errors individuate mean field soil moisture values in good agreement with mean watershed soil moisture values. Â© 2008 SPIE.

TI  - Calibration of a {TDR} probe for low soil water content measurements
VL  - 147
SN  - NA
AB  - Time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes are increasingly used for field and laboratory estimation of soil water content. Usual calibration of TDR probes for the determination of soil water content uses two media: air for low and water for high values of dielectric permittivity, although the measured range of dielectric permittivity in soil is much smaller as compared to the range implied by the calibration media. The use of air for calibration of short TDR probes gives calibration errors due to overlapping incident and reflected pulses in the reflectogram, which result in their relative shift in time. This phenomenon, named the convolution effect, can be avoided by the application of selected calibration media. The presented approach minimizes of dielectric permittivity measurement errors by choosing the calibration media with dielectric permittivity values close to the limits of the measurement range and the possibility to use TDR probes of various lengths. The comparison of errors of TDR apparent dielectric permittivity measurement in three sandy soils, based on the probe calibrations in various media, is also presented. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - FT}-{NIR} spectroscopy technique based analysis and prediction on soil nutrient content of {Lychee} orchardâ€“{A} case study in zhongluotan of guangzhou, {South} {China
VL  - 7145
SN  - NA
AB  - Precision farming with Geoinformatics is a new paradigm for agricultural production, especially in a developing country as China. Precision agriculture is an integrated application referring to the advanced 3S (remote sensing, GIS and GPS) technology and spectroscopy, and the key of this technology is to obtain the spatial and temporal information of the environmental factors such as soil nutrients, which has an influence on the growth of the Lychee crop and agricultural environment protection, and then the appropriate measurement in standard prescription can be adopted to realize "prescription farming" with efficiency for agricultural resource saving and environment protecting. Considering the actual problems and deficiencies of the present technology in the quick information extraction of Lychee soil nutrient, we systematically analyzed the relationships between the intelligent soil Fourier NIR spectrum information and Lychee orchard soil nutrient components such as nitrate (N), total phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic matter (OM), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). The content of these components in the 15 in-situ soil samples of Zhongluotan, Guangzhou South China was analyzed against near infrared spectroscopy. The NIR spectral data of soil was treated by partial least square (PLS) analysis, and then the best dimension of analysis was obtained with multivariate linear regression. Upon this, the calibration model was established. The content of some components in Lychee orchard soil was predicted using the calibration model. It is shown that the result of Fourier NIR spectroscopy method was highly related with those of chemical analysis method. The regression coefficients between measured and predicted values of N, OM and pH were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.93, respectively. The correlation coefficient between measured and predicted P, K, Ca, and Mg were satisfactorily acceptable at 0.65, 0.74, 0.61 and 0.69, respectively. It showed that the Fourier NIR spectroscopy method is a good tool for soil nutrient prediction of Lychee garden, especially for soil N, OM and pH. The accuracy of the FT-NIR based PLS models for predict soil nutrient concentration was adequate to be used as a quick evaluation of nutrient composition of Lychee orchard soil for the precision agriculture application Â© 2008 SPIE.

TI  - Beach soil moisture measurement with a land reflected {GPS} bistatic radar technique
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - In this work we investigate the potential for sensing beach soil moisture with the L band GPS bistatic radar concept. Characterisation of sediment surface (properties like humidity) is indeed important to better understand morphodynamic activity of intertidal part of beaches. In our approach we compare the direct GPS Signal to Noise Ratio with the reflected one in order to measure the soil moisture. We use a bit grabber to digitize and store the GPS L1 carrier (1.5 Ghz) samples. In this context the signal processing is off-line. In this work we proposed a model of the received signal after demodulation and demultiplexing. We deduce from this model a MAP estimate of the navigation message and of the signal SNR. In our case the signal model is a piecewise stationary process with change instants at bit edge position. We present preliminary SNR measurement with this technique for the discrimination of water and humid sand. Â© 2008 IEEE.

VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - The spatial distributions and variability of the main nutrients in the topsoil of Chongming island of China are explored by using geostatistics combining with GIS. The multi-scale model is used to analyze the spatial pattern of soil nutrient factors based on the principle of Minimum Nugget Effect to ensure the stability of the interpolation model with the high interpolating accuracy. The result shows that AK and CEC distributed with a moderate variance while AN, TN, AP and OM with strong variance. CEC has an insignificant autocorrelation, contrasting to the significant autocorrelation of TN. Multi-scaled model can harmonize the dilemma of global generalization and local accuracy; the maps of soil nutrients can illustrate the distribution of them in the continuity of the soil surface. The coefficients of soil fertility calculated based on the spatial analysis indicate that the anisotropism of these factors were affected by the soil salinity to different extent. Â© 2009 IEEE.

A measuring method based on impedance commutation of transmission line was presented to measure soil water content in this paper. The sensor measuring performance with different probe structure, i.e. the probe with single pin, 2 pins, 3 pins, and 4 pins, was studied elaborately. 4-pin probe is proved to be the best structure to get linear relationship between voltage and soil water content by experiment results, and it is benefit to collect data, deal with data and export data. The measuring method and the sensor are used in the automatic saving water irrigation system at the greenbelt demonstration area of Beijing Forestry University, and the results indicate that the measuring method is valid and feasible.

TI  - Available soil phosphorus in semi-natural grasslands: {Assessment} methods and community tolerances
VL  - 142
SN  - NA
AB  - Restoration of diverse semi-natural grasslands is potentially limited by high availability of soil phosphorus (P). Successful targeting of restoration effort requires a knowledge of plant community tolerances to soil P availability. Many extraction methods for P availability have been developed but most are calibrated against the growth and P uptake of crop species grown in monoculture. To test which methods are most suitable for measuring available P in soils of mesotrophic grasslands, a bioassay experiment was undertaken to compare seven extraction methods with the growth and P uptake of grassland species. Five species were grown together on a soil treated to create a range of conditions of pH, mycorrhizal infection and P availability. Olsen P and Bray P were found to be significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth across the range of soil treatments whilst ion exchange membrane P and resin P were significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth in all but the calcareous soils. The acid extractions of Truog, acetic acid and EDTA-ammonium acetate were found to be less correlated with P uptake in plant growth. All extraction methods correlated more strongly with P uptake in the sterilised treatments than in those inoculated with mycorrhizal spores. The method of Olsen was therefore selected to analyse P availability in soils supporting a range of mesotrophic grassland communities from eleven sites across England. At each sampling location, the species composition of the vegetation was assessed and classified using the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC). Species-rich hay meadows across a range of alliances were found to occur on soils with low phosphorus availability. Species-poor communities, such as inundation grassland, were found to occur on soils with higher phosphorus availability. Pasture communities, of intermediate species richness, tended to occur on soils of intermediate phosphorus availability. Olsen's method of P extraction is recommended for analysing soils of areas identified for habitat creation; values of less than 10 mg kg-1 will give the greatest potential for the restoration of species-rich mesotrophic grassland.

AB  - Mapping and dating soil total nitrogen is of great importance in soil use and evaluation. In this study we examine the feasibility of soil nitrogen content by using hyperspectrally reflective remote sensing methodology. This technique was tested in Hengshan County, northern Shanxi Province of China. The soil reflectance properties of samples were measured in the laboratory by ASD field spectrometer. The correlation analysis related with nitrogen content was processed with the spectral reflectance factors (the first derivative reflectance, the logarithmic reflectance and absorption depth). The results show that the first derivative reflectance at sensitive bands of 480nm, 980nm and 2210nm has more notable correlation coefficient as compared to other parameters. Knowing these correlations we were able to build up the multivariate regression model and map the soil total nitrogen content by calculating each pixel of Hyperion image. The accuracy assessment by relating predicted nitrogen values with measured ones of a linear regression showed that the map is reliable and significantly correlative with known stabilization processes throughout the study area. Moreover, this quantitative methodology developed in this study for mapping soil total nitrogen content can also be applied to other regions throughout the world. Â© 2009 IEEE.

TI  - Dung pads increase pasture production, soil nutrients and microbial biomass carbon in grazed dairy systems
VL  - 84
SN  - NA
AB  - In grazing systems dung is an important source of nutrients which can increase soil fertility and contribute to nutrient cycling through increased pasture production. Changes in soil chemical and biological properties and pasture production were measured below and around dung pads created in the field. Almost 65\% of the total dung P remained after 45 days and about two-thirds of the pad fresh weight had disappeared in that time, indicating that physical degradation is the mechanism of incorporation of dung P. All the pads bar one were completely degraded by 112 days. At this time, soil pH and EC increased under dung pads as did Olsen extractable inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and total phosphorus (Pt), with these changes observed at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths. Bicarbonate extractable soil organic phosphorus (Po) was not affected by dung and the observed differences in soil Po:Pi ratios were largely influenced by the substantial addition of inorganic P from dung. Dung increased the P buffering capacity of the 0-5 cm soil samples collected at the end of the experiment, potentially contributing to the increased extractable soil P measured under the pads. Dung also changed soil properties in 0-10 cm samples with increases in soil pH, EC, Colwell P and Colwell K recorded even long after the dung had completely disappeared. Microbial biomass carbon increased under dung pads in the 0-10 cm soil samples in the first 45 days after pads were applied. Total herbage production and ryegrass biomass increased significantly under and around the pads by 112 days after dung was applied. The botanical composition changed significantly with increased ryegrass contents observed, but only under the dung pads. This experiment demonstrated that increases in pasture around dung pads in the field are not solely due to animal rejection. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Combining bistatic and monostatic radar measurements for retrieving soil moisture
VL  - 7477
SN  - NA
AB  - The problem of soil moisture retrieval by means of a bistatic radar system, for the purpose of investigating a candidate bistatic mission, is addressed in this paper. The optimal geometric configuration of measurement in terms of incidence and observation (scattering) directions is identified. Such a configuration should ensure good sensitivity to soil moisture and good spatial coverage. We use a theoretical scattering model to simulate the bistatic scattering coefficient of bare soil for analyzing the sensitivity to soil moisture. The error variance of a linear regression estimator is employed for this purpose. This index is computed as function of elevation and azimuth scattering angles. Results shows that the best performances in terms of soil moisture retrieval can be achieved by complementing the bistatic measurements with the monostatic ones, which are supposed to be available through already operating spaceborne radars. The problem of the feasibility of the bistatic configuration identified through the sensitivity study is also addressed focusing on the duty cycle and the spatial coverage. Â© 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Evaluation of tobacco soil fertility suitability of the {Sanmenxia} area, {China}, based on geographic information systems
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - The growth of flue-cured tobacco is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Excellent tobacco leaf production is strictly restricted by regional cultivated lands. For the purpose of reasonable utilization and scientific management of Sanmenxia tobacco fields, it is meaningful to evaluate the soil fertility suitability of tobacco crops quantitatively and objectively. In this study, the global positioning system (GPS) technology was used to obtain sample point information automatically. Based on the analysis of fertility properties of soil samples collected from the Sanmenxia tobacco planting regions in Henan Province, we present the index system of soil fertility suitability for tobacco crops. The integrated evaluation of soil fertility suitability was studied with six indices, including organic matter, pH value, available nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), and chlorine (Cl-1) content of surface soil. The subjective grade value was calculated according to S-type and parabola-type functions of the effect of evaluation factors on tobacco crops. Further, the weight value of soil fertility suitability indices was calculated by the method of Hiberarchy analysis. The soil fertility suitability level was evaluated and classified. The suitability map of the Sanmenxia tobacco planting regions in Henan Province was then drawn with the geographic information system (GIS) software mapGIS. It was found that highly suitable fields were mainly distributed in the high mountains in the Southwestern part of the investigated regions where soil pH value and the contents of organic matter were medium, but the contents of available P and available K were higher, accounting for 79.36\% of the whole area. Suitable fields were 17\% of the whole area, mainly distributed in the middle part of the investigated regions where soil pH value was higher. Unsuitable fields existed in the northern-east and middle part of the Sanmenxia where the contents of soil Cl- was very high, accounting for 3. 51\% of the whole regions.

TI  - Assimilation of remote sensing data into a process-based ecosystem model for monitoring changes of soil water content in croplands
VL  - 7145
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content (SWC) is an important factor affecting photosynthesis, growth, and final yields of crops. The information on SWC is of importance for mitigating the reduction of crop yields caused by drought through proper agricultural water management. A variety of methodologies have been developed to estimate SWC at local and regional scales, including field sampling, remote sensing monitoring and model simulations. The reliability of regional SWC simulation depends largely on the accuracy of spatial input datasets, including vegetation parameters, soil and meteorological data. Remote sensing has been proved to be an effective technique for controlling uncertainties in vegetation parameters. In this study, the vegetation parameters (leaf area index and land cover type) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) were assimilated into a process-based ecosystem model BEPS for simulating the variations of SWC in croplands of Jiangsu province, China. Validation shows that the BEPS model is able to capture 81\% and 83\% of across-site variations of SWC at 10 and 20 cm depths during the period from September to December, 2006 when a serous autumn drought occurred. The simulated SWC responded the events of rainfall well at regional scale, demonstrating the usefulness of our methodology for SWC and practical agricultural water management at large scales.

TI  - Resource flows, crops and soil fertility management in smallholder farming systems in semi-arid {Zimbabwe
VL  - 25
SN  - NA
AB  - Poor soil fertility and erratic rains are major constraints to crop production in semi-arid environments. In the smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa, these constraints are manifested in frequent crop failures and endemic food insecurity. We characterized a semi-arid smallholder farming system in south-western Zimbabwe to assess crop production, nutrient use and factors that constrain productivity. The farming system was studied using resource flow mapping, farmer interviews and calculations of crop production over three cropping seasons (2002/2003, 2003/2004 and 2004/2005) to capture variability between years. Farmers were categorized into three groups: better resourced, medium resourced and poorly resourced. Better resourced farmers produced adequate grain for basic household consumption, except in the drought year (2002/2003). Poorly resourced farmers had large grain deficits, whereas the medium resourced class had smaller deficits. Better resourced and medium resourced farmers produced adequate amounts of staple cereal in two of the seasons, while poorly resourced farmers produced inadequate amounts of food in all three seasons. All farmers produced less than 300 kg/ha of legumes per season. Lack of seed was cited as the main reason for poor legume production. Better resourced farmers used animal manure (2000-5000 kg per season) and some fertilizer on their cereal crops, while the medium resourced group used less manure (1000 kg or less) and no fertilizer. The use of manure varied strongly across the years. Poorly resourced farmers used no nutrient inputs on any of their crops. All groups had negative nitrogen balances during the three cropping seasons, although the values varied strongly between seasons. Investigation of the potential strategies for developing sustainable production systems are required to address the problems of food security in the semi-arid parts of the country and the region.

TI  - Implementation of a global-scale operational data assimilation system for satellite-based soil moisture retrievals
VL  - 7085
SN  - NA
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of global weather anomalies and drought conditions is essential for assessing global crop conditions. Soil moisture observations are particularly important for crop yield fluctuations provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Production Estimation and Crop Assessment Division (PECAD). The current system utilized by PECAD estimates soil moisture from a 2-layer water balance model based on precipitation and temperature data from World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and US Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). The accuracy of this system is highly dependent on the data sources used; particularly the accuracy, consistency, and spatial and temporal coverage of the land and climatic data input into the models. However, many regions of the globe lack observations at the temporal and spatial resolutions required by PECAD. This study incorporates NASA's soil moisture remote sensing product provided by the EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the U.S. Department of Agriculture Crop Assessment and Data Retrieval (CADRE) decision support system. A quasi-global-scale operational data assimilation system has been designed and implemented to provide CADRE a daily product of integrated AMSR-E soil moisture observations with the PECAD two-layer soil moisture model forecasts. A methodology of the system design and a brief evaluation of the system performance over the Conterminous United States (CONUS) is presented.

TI  - A sequential model for disaggregating near-surface soil moisture observations using multi-resolution thermal sensors
VL  - 113
SN  - NA
AB  - A sequential model is developed to disaggregate microwave-derived soil moisture from 40 km to 4 km resolution using MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and subsequently from 4 km to 500 m resolution using ASTER (Advanced Scanning Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. The 1 km resolution airborne data collected during the three-week National Airborne Field Experiment 2006 (NAFE'06) are used to simulate the 40 km pixels, and a thermal-based disaggregation algorithm is applied using 1 km resolution MODIS and 100 m resolution ASTER data. The downscaled soil moisture data are subsequently evaluated using a combination of airborne and in situ soil moisture measurements. A key step in the procedure is to identify an optimal downscaling resolution in terms of disaggregation accuracy and sub-pixel soil moisture variability. Very consistent optimal downscaling resolutions are obtained for MODIS aboard Terra, MODIS aboard Aqua and ASTER, which are 4 to 5 times the thermal sensor resolution. The root mean square error between the 500 m resolution sequentially disaggregated and ground-measured soil moisture is 0.062 vol./vol. with a bias of - 0.045 vol./vol. and values ranging from 0.08 to 0.40 vol./vol.

VL  - 7472
SN  - NA
AB  - Spatial and temporal information of soil water content is of essential importance for modelling of land surface processes in hydrological studies and applications for operative systems of irrigation management. In the last decades, several remote sensing domains have been considered in the context of soil water content monitoring, ranging from active and passive microwave to optical and thermal spectral bands. In the framework of an experimental campaign in Southern Italy in 2007, two innovative methodologies to retrieve soil water content information from airborne earth observation (E.O.) data were exploited: a) analyses of the dependence of surface temperature of vegetation with soil water content using thermal infrared radiometer (TIR), and b) estimation of superficial soil moisture content using reflectance in the visible and near infrared regions acquired from optical sensors. The first method (a) is applicable especially at surfaces completely covered with vegetation, whereas the second method is preferably applicable at surfaces without or with sparse vegetation. The synergy of both methods allows the establishment of maps of spatially distributed soil water content. Results of the analyses are presented and discussed, in particular in view of an operative context in irrigation studies. Â© 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Adoption of integrated soil fertility and nutrient management approach: {Farmers}' preferences for extension teaching methods in {Bangladesh
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - The major purpose of the study was to determine the extent of preferences of different categories of farmers for effective extension teaching methods aimed at encouraging adoption of the Integrated Soil Fertility (ISF) and Nutrient Management (NM) approach. Data were collected from 120 farmers from eight villages in four districts in Bangladesh between December 2007 and January 2008. Of these farmers, 39 landless, 34 marginal, 19 small, 20 medium and 8 were large farmers. A four-point rating scale was used to analyze the preferences: strongly resist, mildly resist, mildly prefer and strongly prefer corresponded to scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The majority of the landless, marginal and small farmers prefened individual extension teaching methods; on the other hand, the largest segment of medium and large farmers preferred group and mass extension teaching methods. Inadequate education, poor training and low income were the major reasons for the landless, marginal and small farmers' relatively higher preferences for individual teaching methods. The channel of transfer of crop production technology showed that extension service providers had very little involvement in pre-extension activities. Conversely, farmers and farmers' representatives played very little role in planning, implementing, evaluating and verification of trials undertaken by the extension department. Present different farmers' groups require different types of extension teaching methods in order to adopt the ISF and NM approach. Â© 2009 Academic Journals Inc.

TI  - Multi-scale soil moisture measurements at the {Gourma} meso-scale site in {Mali
VL  - 375
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents the ground soil moisture measurements performed over the so-called Gourma meso-scale site in Mali, Sahel, in the context of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project. The Gourma meso-scale soil moisture network is part of a complete land surface processes observing and modelling strategy and is associated to vegetation and meteorological field measurements as well as soil moisture remote sensing. It is spanning 2 Â° in latitude between 15 Â°N and 17 Â°N. In 2007, it includes 10 soil moisture stations, of which three stations also have meteorological and flux measurements. A relevant spatial sampling strategy is proposed to characterise soil moisture at different scales including local, kilometer, super-site and meso-scales. In addition to the local stations network, transect measurements were performed on different coarse textured (sand to sandy-loam) sites, using portable impedance probes. They indicate mean value and standard deviation (STD) of the surface soil moisture (SSM) at the kilometer scale. This paper presents the data set and illustrates soil moisture spatial and temporal features over the Sahelian Gourma meso-scale site for 2005-2006. Up-scaling relation of SSM is investigated from (i) local to kilometer scale and (ii) from local to the super site scale. It is shown to be stable in space and time (2005-2006) for different coarse textured sites. For the Agoufou local site, the up-scaling relation captures SSM dynamics at the kilometer scale with a 0.9\% accuracy in volumetric soil moisture. At the multi-site scale, an unique up-scaling relation is shown to be able to represent kilometer SSM for the coarse textured soils of the meso-scale site with an accuracy of 2.2\% (volumetric). Spatial stability of the ground soil moisture stations network is also addressed by the Mean Relative Difference (MRD) approach for the Agoufou super site where five soil moisture stations are available (about 25 km Ã— 25 km). This allows the identification of the most representative ground soil moisture station which is shown to be an accurate indicator with low variance and bias of the soil moisture dynamics at the scale of the super site. Intensive local measurements, together with a robust up-scaling relation make the Gourma soil moisture network suitable for a large range of applications including remote sensing and land surface modelling at different spatial scales.

AB  - Low-cost, rapid and reliable detection technologies for soil nutrients can improve the effectiveness of data collection for site-specific management of soil fertility. In this study, an automated fluidic control system was developed for rapid detection of soil nutrients. Micro pump and valves, controlled by a lap-top computer, delivered a sequence of test solutions to a test chamber where ion selective electrodes are mounted. A 90 seconds test time with acceptable accuracy was demonstrated. This automated soil nutrient fluidic system can further be miniaturized and may be useful for in-field rapid detection of soil nutrients. Â© 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Improved cultural practices are required to enhance the adaptability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in northern latitudes. Field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of cropping systems, cultivar choices, and soil fertility on the stand establishment, seed yield, and yield stability of chickpea in northern latitudes. Four cultivars were tested in no-till barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), no-till wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and tilled-fallow systems at six environments in southern Saskatchewan, 2004- 2006. Crop received N fertilizer at 0, 28, 64, 84, and 112 kg N ha-1 with or without Rhizobium inoculant (GR). The no-till barley and no-till wheat systems did not differ from the tilled-fallow system in days to plant emergence and stand establishment, and the two no-till systems averaged 2100 kg ha-1of seed yield which was 83\% of the yield in the tilled-fallow system. In the absence of GR, increasing N rates increased seed yield significantly in the two no-till systems, no yield responses in the tilled-fallow system, and decreased plant density in all the three systems. Compared to the non-GR control, the use of GR increased seed yield by 37\% in the no-till systems and 8\% in the tilled-fallow system. Chickpea inoculated with GR produced a similar yield as was fertilized at 112 kg N ha-1. Chickpea receiving fertilizer N plus GR produced a similar yield as the crop received GR only for all cultivars. Use of optimal cropping systems, improved cultivars with high yield stability, and application of effective N-fixing inoculants will enhance the adaptability of chickpea in northern latitudes.

TI  - A {Markov} chain {Monte} {Carlo} algorithm for upscaled soil-vegetation- atmosphere-transfer modeling to evaluate satellite-based soil moisture measurements
VL  - 44
SN  - NA
AB  - A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithm was developed to derive upscaled land surface parameters for a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model using time series data of satellite-measured atmospheric forcings (e.g., precipitation), and land surface states (e.g., soil moisture and vegetation). This study focuses especially on the evaluation of soil moisture measurements of the Aqua satellite based Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) instrument using the new MCMC-based scaling algorithm. Soil moisture evolution was modeled at a spatial scale comparable to the AMSR-E soil moisture product, with the hypothesis that the characterization of soil microwave emissions and their variations with space and time on soil surface within the AMSR-E footprint can be represented by an ensemble of upscaled soil hydraulic parameters. We demonstrated the features of the MCMC-based parameter upscaling algorithm (from field to satellite footprint scale) within a SVAT model framework to evaluate the satellite-based brightness temperature/soil moisture measurements for different hydroclimatic regions, and identified the temporal effects of vegetation (leaf area index) and other environmental factors on AMSR-E based remotely sensed soil moisture data. The SVAT modeling applied for different hydroclimatic regions revealed the limitation of AMSR-E measurements in high-vegetation regions. The study also suggests that inclusion of soil moisture evolution from the proposed upscaled SVAT model with AMSR-E measurements in data assimilation routine will improve the quality of soil moisture assessment in a footprint scale. The technique also has the potential to derive upscaled parameters of other geophysical properties used in remote sensing of land surface states. The developed MCMC algorithm with SVAT model can be very useful for land-atmosphere interaction studies and further understanding of the physical controls responsible for soil moisture dynamics at different scales.

TI  - Hillslope-scale controls on remote sensing of soil moisture with microwave radiometry
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Microwave radiometry is emerging as an important tool for global remote sensing of near-surface soil moisture in the coming decade. In a modeling study, we find that hillslopescale topography (10's of meters) influences predicted microwave brightness temperatures at significantly coarser scales (kilometers). Through the physics of microwave remote sensing, topography is understood to effect brightness temperature observations in two important ways: (1) modulating the spatial distribution of factors affecting emission like vegetation biomass, moisture, and surface and canopy temperatures, and (2) determining the incidence angle and polarization rotation the observing sensor makes with the local land surface. Local incidence and polarization rotation angles can be explicitly computed knowing local terrain slope and aspect and sky position of the sensor. In an analysis of two synthetic domains, predicted hillslope-scale brightness temperatures within a less rugged landscape that is presented here can vary from, approximately 224 to 302 K in the horizontal polarization and from approximately 298 to 320 K in the vertical polarization. Impacts of hillslope-scale heterogeneity in factors effecting emission account for at most approximately 2 K in predicted watershed-scale brightness temperature, while impacts of hillslope-scale topography on observing geometry can account for up to 28 K in predicted watershed-scale brightness temperatures in a topographically rugged area.

TI  - Manure and soil fertility management in sub-humid and semi-arid farming systems of {Sub}-{Saharan} {Africa}: {Experiences} from {Kenya
VL  - 3
SN  - NA
AB  - A study was conducted in the sub-humid Kiambu and in the semi-arid Mbeere districts of Kenya to determine smallholder farmers' manure management practices and quantity and quality of on-farm available manure under different livestock management systems. Data collected from 60 smallholder farmers identified manure management practices to be variable and poor irrespective of management system. The quality of cattle manure in the open grazing systems of Mbeere was poorer (1.22\% N; 0.09\% P; 2.14\% K) and of higher variability than manures from zero-grazing systems of Kiambu (1.41\% N; 0.53\% P; 1.54\% K) where animals are supplied with high quality feed supplements. We calculated the potential manure production to be 3.1 and 0.7 tonnes DM year-1 farm-1 for Kiambu and Mbeere, respectively. Faced with low manure availability, farmers adopted manure management strategies that included accumulation in livestock pens and or removal from livestock pens and storing over time before spatial and temporal application to selected crops and plots in a rotational pattern. In both study sites, the sole application of manure or inorganic fertilizers proved limited in providing a comprehensive solution to crop nutrient supply. Given this limitation and the differential farmer resource endowments in sub-humid and semi-arid study sites, appropriate strategies for improving manure storage, quantity and quality, efficient manure use and application methods and integrated soil fertility management need to be developed, separately for each livestock management system, to enhance crop nutrient supply.

VL  - 100
SN  - NA
AB  - Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies for African smallholders should consider (i) within-farm soil heterogeneity; (ii) long-term dynamics and variability; (iii) manure quality and availability; (iv) access to fertilizers; and (v) competing uses for crop residues. We used the model FIELD (Field-scale resource Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long term soil fertility Development) to explore allocation strategies of manure and fertilizers. Maize response to N fertilizer from 0 to 180 kg N ha-1 (Â±30 kg P ha-1) distinguished poorly responsive fertile (e.g., grain yields of 4.1-5.3 t ha-1 without P and of 7.5-7.5 t ha -1 with P) from responsive (1.0-4.3 t ha-1 and 2.2-6.6 t ha-1) and poorly responsive infertile fields (0.2-1.0 t ha -1 and 0.5-3.1 t ha-1). Soils receiving manure plus fertilizers for 12 yr retained 1.1 to 1.5 t C ha-1 yr-1 when 70\% of the crop residue was left in the field, and 0.4 to 0.7 t C ha -1 yr-1 with 10\% left. Degraded fields were not rehabilitated with manures of local quality (e.g., 23-35\% C, 0.5-1.2\% N, 0.1-0.3\% P) applied at realistic rates (3.6 t dm ha-1 yr -1) for 12 yr without fertilizers. Mineral fertilizers are necessary to kick-start soil rehabilitation through hysteretic restoration of biomass productivity and C inputs to the soil.

TI  - Differential response to tree fallows in rotational woodlot systems in semi-arid {Tanzania}: {Post}-fallow maize yield, nutrient uptake, and soil nutrients
VL  - 125
SN  - NA
AB  - Agroforestry tree species producing high quality litter may enhance post-fallow soil nutrient availability and crop yields through mineralization of soil organic matter and green manure. A split-plot field experiment was used to evaluate maize yield and soil N and P status after fallowing indigenous and exotic tree species of contrasting litter quality. Responses were compared with recommended inorganic fertilizer use. The objective was to assess efficacy of 5-year tree fallows in improving soil productivity to screen species for increased crop yield under rotational woodlot culture, an agroforestry system mainly used for on-farm fuelwood production in semi-arid Tanzania. Post-fallow maize yield and soil nutrients differed significantly among tree fallows. Low C:N and L:N ratios enhanced nutrient release from slash. Acacia polyacantha (indigenous) and Gliricidia sepium fallows doubled maize yield compared to the natural fallow probably due to high soil N and P levels resulting from net release by high quality foliage. First season maize yield was similar to that from combined N and P fertilizers indicating high capacity of the fallows to improve crop yields and reduce fertilizer inputs usually unaffordable to small-scale farmers. Comparatively low maize yield and soil N and P levels after exotic Acacia crassicarpa and Acacia mangium fallows were attributed to net N immobilization by poor quality litter during growing seasons. This study suggests that rotational woodlot systems utilizing tree species with high litter quality can improve both post-fallow maize yield and soil fertility as well as produce sufficient fuelwood. In this aspect, A. polyacantha would be the most appropriate species. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A soil moisture smart sensor web using data assimilation and optimal {controL}: {Formulation} and first laboratory demonstration
VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - We have developed a new concept for a smart sensor web technology for measurements of soil moisture that include spaceborne and in-situ assets. The objective of the technology is to enable a guided/adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the measurement validation objectives of the spaceborne sensors with respect to resolution and accuracy. One potential application is the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission. The science measurements considered are the surface-to-depth profiles of soil moisture estimated from satellite radars and radiometers, with calibration and validation using in-situ sensors. Installing an in-situ network to sample the field for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser but smarter network can provide the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in the context of a dynamic data assimilation system subject to energy and accuracy constraints. The overall design of the smart sensor web including the control architecture, assimilation framework, and actuation hardware are presented in this paper. We also present results of initial numerical and laboratory demonstrations of the sensor web concept, which includes a small number of soil moisture. Â© 2008 IEEE.

AB  - In the past 50 years, large areas of the Horqin sandy land were afforested to prevent desertification. Although the afforestation policy appears successful, many people now doubt whether it is suitable to plant trees with high density on the poor soils in semiarid regions. Little is known about the impacts of afforestation on the sandy soil properties, although the evaluation of these impacts is fundamental to judge the rationality of afforestation policy. Soil phosphorus (P) fractions, acid phosphomonoesterase activities, and other soil chemical properties were compared among five adjoining typical ecosystems on poor sandy soils in southeastern Horqin sandy land. The ecosystems studied are natural elm savanna, degraded grassland, Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) plantation, Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation, and mixed plantation of Mongolian pine and poplar (Populus simonii). The results showed that organic P dominated soil P (47\%-65\%) was the principal source of available P. The degradation of elm savanna to grassland significantly reduced soil pH and resulted in an overall reduction in soil fertility, although slightly increased labile inorganic P. Grassland afforestation had no significant influence on soil pH, organic carbon, and total N but significantly reduced total P. Impacts of grassland afforestation on soil P fractions depended on tree species. Natural elm savanna had higher soil P conserving ability than artificial plantations. Therefore, with the aim of developing a sustainable ecosystem, we suggested that vegetations with low nutrient demand (particularly P) and efficient nutrient cycling would be more suitable for ecosystem restoration in the semiarid region.

VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Adequate availability of water during the potato-growing season is critical for production of high yields of premium processing quality tubers. Real-time, continuous monitoring of soil water content in the soil profile can be used to optimize irrigation. In this study, capacitance probes were used for automated measurement of soil water content at 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 cm depth in a Center Pivot irrigated potato (cv. Ranger Russet) field in a Quincy fine sand (mixed, mesic, Xeric Torripsamments). Depth integrated soil water content was calculated within the rooting depth (0-60 cm) and below the rooting depth (60-120 cm). Irrigation was scheduled to replenish either full evapotranspiration (ET), or 70\% of ET (deficit irrigation). The soil water content at the 10 and 30 cm depth, as well as depth integrated soil water content in the 0-60 cm depth soil responded to each irrigation event. The Full Point and Refill Point for the soil within potato root zone (0-60 cm depth) were estimated to represent the maximum water holding capacity, and the soil water content at which irrigation is to be scheduled to avoid water stress, respectively. Depth integrated soil water content in the 0-60 cm-depth soil profile remained mostly above the Full Point during most of the growing season in the Full ET irrigation treatment, but remained within the Full Point and Refill Point for the deficit irrigation treatment.

TI  - Correction of {TDR}-based soil water content measurements in conductive soils
VL  - 143
SN  - NA
AB  - Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is a widespread technique for measurement of soil water content (SWC). The main assumption behind the use of Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is of negligible losses, therefore assuming that only the real part determines the value of the TDR-measured apparent dielectric permittivity. This assumption does not hold for soils where surfaces are conductive (clay soils) or where high concentrations of electrolyte are present in the soil solution (saline soils) because under these conditions the contribution of the imaginary part becomes important. One of the main effects of dielectric losses on the TDR measurement is overestimation of SWC. In this study we present a methodology for separating the real and the imaginary part from the measurement of the apparent dielectric permittivity. This approach allows correction of the SWC overestimation, by using the TDR-measured electrical conductivity as indicator of dielectric losses. Oven-dry gravimetric soil water content was used as an independent method for soil water content assessment. The original SWC overestimation (in respect to the oven-dry gravimetric based measurement) reached values of up to 20\% of total soil saturation, after the correction the differences were reduced to a 3-5\%. The methodology can be applied based on knowledge of measured permittivity and electrical conductivity only, making it readily applicable to field experiments. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The following study presents a format in which the spatial and temporal variations that govern upper surface (0-5cm) soil moisture regimes within ecologically sensitive regions such as "Pine Barrens" can be studied. Based on in situ measurements, coupled with satellite derived analysis, radar backscatter, surface roughness, incidence angles, relative beam modes, and nominal area coverage, comparable soil moisture data between simulated and measured values within the upper surface (0-5cm) soil moisture regime can be analyzed.

TI  - Soil fertility advantages of submerged rice cropping systems
VL  - 31
SN  - NA
AB  - Wetland rice production systems in Asia are making a major contribution to the global rice supply. Wetland rice cultivation is often cited as an example of a sustainable cropping system. Wetland or paddy rice growing involves land preparation by cultivating in the flooded or saturated state (puddling), followed by transplanting of seedlings in soils under submerged condition and growing of the crop until two to three weeks before harvest. In other rice-based cropping systems, the land is either dryor flood-fallowed during the period between two crops. Afterwards, two or three crops of rice are grown in submerged soil condition. However, shortage of freshwater is becoming critical for this traditional lowland rice cultivation. Obviously, there is high potential in exploring rice cultivation under moisture regimes that save water and also increase productivity. Such a situation provides an opportunity to critically analyze the fertility benefits of submerged rice cropping systems that would help facilitate in making a practical and right choice for growing of rice in future. The objective of this paper is to highlight the underlying principles, which govern the fertility advantages to submerged rice cropping systems. The advantages of growing rice in submerged soils include a general amelioration of chemical fertility, preferential accumulation of organic matter and improved availability of major, secondary and selected micronutrients. These soil fertility advantages benefit the long-term maintenance of soil fertility and sustainability of wetland rice systems. The paper emphasizes the potential of growing wetland rice in monsoon Asia, specifically in poorly drained, waterlogging-prone areas where the water table is shallow (within 30 cm of the soil surface).

During active microwave remote sensing the backscattering from the target i.e, the soil surface is adversely affected by the overlaying vegetation, consequently, sending degraded signal back to the radar sensor. This phenomena greatly compromise with the quality of soil moisture measurements. The proposed research presents an algorithm that averts usage of theoretical and empirical backscattering models. The algorithm uses Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer model for soil moisture estimation that is used to quantify the backscattering components of radar signals. The algorithm, has simple and valid assumptions that convert the total radar backscattering equations for a particular temporal scale into a set of simple linear systems. The algorithm, reasonably estimates the stochastic surface roughness and vegetation backscattering components. Â©2008 IEEE.

TI  - On the value of soil moisture measurements in vadose zone hydrology: {A} review
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - We explore and review the value of soil moisture measurements in vadose zone hydrology with a focus on the field and catchment scales. This review is motivated by the increasing ability to measure soil moisture with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution across scales. We highlight and review the state of the art in using soil moisture measurements for (1) estimation of soil hydraulic properties, (2) quantification of water and energy fluxes, and (3) retrieval of spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture profiles. We argue for the urgent need to have access to field monitoring sites and databases that include detailed information about variability of hydrological fluxes and parameters, including their upscaled values. In addition, improved data assimilation methods are needed that fully exploit the information contained in soil moisture data. The development of novel upscaling methods for predicting effective moisture fluxes and disaggregation schemes toward integrating large-scale soil moisture measurements in hydrological models will increase the value of soil moisture measurements. Finally, we recognize a need to develop strategies that combine hydrogeophysical measurement techniques with remote sensing methods.

TI  - Comparison of field performance of multiple soil moisture sensors in a semi-arid rangeland
VL  - 44
SN  - NA
AB  - Automated electronic soil moisture sensors, such as time domain reflectometry (TDR) and capacitance probes are being used extensively to monitor and measure soil moisture in a variety of scientific and land management applications. These sensors are often used for a wide range of soil moisture applications such as drought forage prediction or validation of large-scale remote sensing instruments. The convergence of three different research projects facilitated the evaluation and comparison of three commercially available electronic soil moisture probes under field application conditions. The sensors are all installed in shallow soil profiles in a well instrumented small semi-arid shrub covered subwatershed in Southeastern Arizona. The sensors use either a TDR or a capacitance technique; both of which indirectly measure the soil dielectric constant to determine the soil moisture content. Sensors are evaluated over a range of conditions during three seasons comparing responses to natural wetting and drying sequences and using water balance and infiltration simulation models. Each of the sensors responded to the majority of precipitation events; however, they varied greatly in response time and magnitude from each other. Measured profile soil moisture storage compared better to water balance estimates when soil moisture in deeper layers was accounted for in the calculations. No distinct or consistent trend was detected when comparing the responses from the sensors or the infiltration model to individual precipitation events. The results underscore the need to understand how the sensors respond under field application and recognize the limitations of soil moisture sensors and the factors that can affect their accuracy in predicting soil moisture in situ.

VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - The soil nitrogen (N) dynamics of an irrigated maize system in which stubble retention and stubble burned treatments were superimposed over treatments of varying N fertiliser rate were studied. The field site was near Whitton, New South Wales, Australia, and the work described here is part a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from maize project. The objective of this part of the work was to quantify the fate of fertiliser N applied at the site. Field measurements of denitrification, mineral N content and recovery of 15N-labelled urea from microplots with and without ammonium thiosulfate were complimented with laboratory studies of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) more fertiliser N was recovered in the grain from the stubble incorporated treatment than the stubble burned treatment and there was greater recovery of fertiliser N in the soil at the end of the experiment in the stubble burned treatment. This may indicate that fertiliser N applied to the stubble burned system may be more exposed to soil-N transformations. The reason for the difference in uptake and soil residual is not clear but may be related to soil structure differences leading to less plant accessibility of N in the burned treatment. This difference may lead to more nitrous oxide emission from soil in the stubble burned treatments. Short-term (1 h) static chamber measurements in the field found a strong N-rate dependence of N2O emission rate for fertiliser rates between 0 and 300 kg N/ha. Inclusion of ammonium thiosulfate in the fertiliser formulation did not appear to have a significant impact on fertiliser N recovery. Â© CSIRO 2008.

TI  - Integrating new soybean varieties for soil fertility management in smallholder systems through participatory research: {Lessons} from western {Kenya
VL  - 97
SN  - NA
AB  - The aim of this paper was to understand the process of selecting soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) promiscuous varieties by smallholders for soil fertility management in western Kenya. Eight varieties were screened on 2.5 m Ã— 3 m plots that were managed according to farmers' practices and evaluated through participatory monitoring and evaluation approaches. Farmers selected preferred varieties and explained their reasons (criteria) for making the selections. Seven promiscuous varieties had better yields than a local one. Farmers' selection criteria fell into three broad categories relating to yield, appearance and labour. Selection criteria were not primarily aimed to improve soil fertility. This created a challenge to embed the new varieties within the local farming systems for soil fertility improvement. This study shows that farmer criteria for selecting varieties overlapped with scientific procedures. We propose co-research activities targeted to strengthen farmer experimentation skills, their understanding on N addition, and the role of P. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Explicit inverse of soil moisture retrieval with an artificial neural network using passive microwave remote sensing data
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important variable that controls the partition of rainfall into infiltration and run-off. This plays an important role in the prediction of erosion, flood or drought. Passive microwave remote sensing data has great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture. This is mainly due to the minimal weather influence on passive microwave data and its ability to penetrate through clouds. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a method that tries simulates human intelligence by crudely imitating the way a human brain learns. This method has been especially useful for mapping non-linear and ill-posed problems. Soil moisture retrieval is an example of a non-linear problem. An explicit inverse of the physical process can be built using an ANN to map the passive microwave measurements into land surface parameters such as soil moisture. For this paper, the ANN method used to create the explicit inverse function is divided into (i.) single parameter retrieval of the soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements, and (ii.) multi-parameter retrieval of a number of land surface parameters, i.e. soil temperature, surface roughness, together with soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements. This paper examines these methods in the context of retrieving surface soil moisture values given microwave radiometric data and discusses key issues that will need to be addressed to improve mapping performance and to produce operational systems.

TI  - Simulating soil fertility and poverty dynamics in {Uganda}: {A} bio-economic multi-agent systems approach
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - Declining soil fertility and increasing rural poverty are major problems facing sub-Saharan agriculture. Bio-economic modeling has been used to analyze the complex interaction between ecological sustainability and rural poverty as well as to explore policy options promoting sustainable development. This paper shows that these models can be further advanced by adopting an agent-based modeling approach. This gives a more realistic representation of diversity in socioeconomic and biophysical terms, allows local interaction between households, and can yield an ex-ante assessment of the distributional consequences of policy intervention. This paper describes the modeling approach and illustrates it with an empirical application to two village communities in the Lake Victoria Crescent of Uganda. It is shown how the model system can be calibrated with and validated against empirical data. The model is used to analyze the potential effect of short-term credit, mineral fertilizer, and improved maize seed on poverty and sustainability. Simulation results suggest substantial reductions in poverty although the incidence of poverty would remain high and these innovations alone would have little effect on the long-term ecological sustainability of the system.

TI  - Influence of bound-water relaxation frequency on soil moisture measurements
VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - In this paper, microwave remote sensing, together with in situ moisture probes, is used to investigate temperature effects on the soil dielectric constant. Field and specific laboratory measurements were performed for different soil water content over a wide range of temperatures. The experimental results lead to the following evidences: 1) temperature effect is different for bound and free waters in soil; 2) bound-water relaxation frequency falls within the range of frequencies that are used by impedance soil moisture probes for field measurements; and 3) the increase of bound-water relaxation frequency with soil temperature interferes in a significant way with moisture measurements when bound-water fraction is important. These results have implications in field experimentation since most moisture sensors operate under 500 MHz and are affected by this phenomena of relaxation. Â© 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Profitability of agro-forestry based soil fertility management technologies: {The} case of small holder food production in {Western} {Kenya
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Persistent food insecurity accompanied by low and declining farm household incomes are a common feature of many small holder maize and bean producers in western Kenya. This has been largely attributed to soil nutrient depletion, among other factors. One way of addressing soil fertility problems in many maize-based cropping systems is the use of agro-forestry based technologies. We carried out a survey in western Kenya (Vihiga and Siaya districts) aimed at analyzing the financial and social profitability of use of agroforestry based (improved tree fallows) and other soil fertility management technologies among smallholder farmers. The Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) was used to determine the financial and social profitability of different production systems, which were categorized on the basis of the technology used to address soil fertility. Farm budgets were first prepared and in turn used to construct the PAMs for six production systems namely: maize-bean intercrop without any soil fertility management inputs; maize-bean intercrop with chemical fertilizers only; maize-bean intercrop with a combination of chemical fertilizers and improved fallows; maize-bean intercrop with improved fallows only; maize-bean intercrop with a combination of improved fallows and rock phosphate; and maize-bean intercrop with Farm Yard Manure (FYM) only. Results revealed that use of chemical fertilizers with improved fallows was the most profitable technology and thus the study recommended that farmers be encouraged to intensify the use of chemical fertilizers. To make chemical fertilizers more accessible to farmers, the study also recommended that good linkages be made between farmers and micro credit institutions so that small scale farmers are not actually biased against due to lack of collateral when credit is being advanced to clients.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract: The effects of the cropping system change for paddy field with double harvest rice on crops growth and soil nutrient in red soil were studied. The results indicated that the economic benefit and the ratio of the output to input were all increased in terms of the market price for the crops under various treatments. The greatest economic benefit was obtained in the treatment of paddy-upland rotation, and the corresponding economic benefit was increased by 34.7, 21.4, and 2.2\% in comparison with that of control (rice-rice-astragali), pasture, and upland cropping treatments. The economic benefits in pasture and upland cultivation treatments were increased by 11.0 and 31.8\%, respectively, when compared with that of the control treatment (CK). The ratio of output to input in pasture, paddy-upland rotation, and upland cropping treatments was enhanced by 0.9, 0.6, and 0.3, respectively, in comparison with that of control. To grow pasture is beneficial for improving soil fertility since the contents of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus are all enhanced significantly. However, the concentrations of the soil available nitrogen, the total potassium, the available potassium were somewhat reduced in all the treatments, suggesting that increasing the input of nitrogen, particularly potassium, was necessary under the present fertilization level. Based on the conditions of fertility, climate, cultivation, and management of paddy field with double harvest rice in red soil regions, it is feasible to alter the cultivation system of paddy field with bad irrigation condition. In particular, cultivation systems such as pasture and paddy-upland rotation can be selected to extend because better economic benefit and improvement of soil fertility in the purpose region were obtained.

TI  - User acceptability of sustainable soil fertility technologies: {Lessons} from farmers' knowledge, attitude and practice in {Southern} {Africa
VL  - 30
SN  - NA
AB  - Low soil fertility is one of the greatest biophysical constraints to agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa. "Improved fallow," an agroforestry-based soil fertility replenishment technology was developed in response to the depletion of soil fertility and increasing difficulty of small-scale farmers to afford mineral fertilizers. The biophysical performance of the technology to improve soil fertility and increase crop yield has been well demonstrated and efforts are being made to enhance the adoption its adoption by farmers. There is relatively little information and systematic feedback regarding farmers' perception and knowledge of the technology. Using data collected from a stratified sample of 302 farmers in Zambia, this study analyzed farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of soil fertility and food security problems, highlighting implications for user acceptability and the development of sustainable soil fertility management technologies. Results show that farmers have good understanding of soil fertility issues, its linkage to food security and household welfare indicators. They appreciate improved fallow because it responds to the critical problems of low soil fertility and provides additional benefits to the household. However, there are some challenges to the widespread uptake of the technology including land constraints, property rights availability of seeds, and knowledge-intensive nature of the technology. Farmer acceptability and improved adoption of the technology will be influenced by the extent to which efforts are taken to meet these challenges. Farmers' response on knowledge, attitude, and perception provides valuable inputs for further development and modification of the technology. Beyond technology development, an understanding of farmers' preference and other contextual issues-within which the technology is expected to be adopted-will enable researchers to develop appropriate sustainable technologies and enhance user acceptability of the same. The study shows that technical characteristics are important but not exclusive conditions for farmers' acceptability and adoption of good agricultural technologies by farmers. doi:10.1300/J064v30n03\_04 Â© Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc.

VL  - 24
SN  - NA
AB  - The Bhuj earthquake (Mw = 7.9) occurred in the western part of India on 26th January 2001 and resulted in the loss of 20,000 lives and caused extensive damage to property. Soil liquefaction related ground failures such as lateral spreading caused significant damage to bridges, dams and other civil engineering structures in entire Kachchh peninsula. The Bhuj area is a part of large sedimentary basin filled with Jurassic, Tertiary and Quaternary deposits. This work pertains to mapping the areas that showed sudden increase in soil moisture after the seismic event, using remote sensing technique. Multi-spectral, spatial and temporal data sets from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite are used to derive the Liquefaction Sensitivity Index (LSeI). The basic concept behind LSeI is that the near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of electromagnetic spectrum are highly absorbed by soil moisture. Thus, the LSeI is herein used to identify the areas with increase in soil moisture after the seismic event. The LSeI map of Bhuj is then correlated with field-based observation on Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR) and Cyclic Resistance Ratio (CRR), depth to water table, soil density and Liquefaction Severity Index (LSI). The derived LSeI values are in agreement with liquefaction susceptible criteria and observed LSI (R2 = 0.97). The results of the study indicate that the LSeI after calibration with LSI can be used as a quick tool to map the liquefied areas. On the basis of LSeI, LSI, CRR, CSR and saturation, the unconsolidated sediments of the Bhuj area are classified into three susceptibility classes. Â© Springer 2006.

VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - A study was carried out in Kiambu District, central highlands of Kenya to explore the effects of household socio-economic factors on farm nutrient balances and agro-economic performance and to determine nutrient depleting and conserving cropping practices in the crop-dairy (mixed) farming system. Data was collected from 30 smallholder farmers and processed using nutrient monitoring (NUTMON) tool. Family earnings (sum of net farm income and off-farm income) were low and off-farm income accounted for 61\% of family earnings of the studied households. On-farm livestock density (TLU ha-1) was the main determinant of farm N, P and K nutrient stocks and balances. The mean farm (total) nutrient balances were -2.6 kg N ha-1 half year-1, 36.7 kg P ha-1 half year-1 and 16.9 kg K ha-1 half year-1. In the analysis, purchased livestock feeds (and fertilizers) were the major determinants of farm N, P and K nutrient balances. The major loss pathway for P and K was erosion, accounting for 35 and 66\% of total P and K outflows respectively. For N, it was leaching. Farmers adopted preferential soil fertility management strategies for cropping practices resulting in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium nutrient mining under Napier (monocrop) and coffee (intercrop) fields and nutrient conservation under maize (intercrop) fields.

TI  - An optical sensor for analysis of soil nutrients by using {LED} light sources
VL  - 18
SN  - NA
AB  - A compact optical sensor based on photometric detection of soil nutrients is developed. The sensor consists of three light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a simple data I/O circuit using a PIC (peripheral interface controller) device. The wavelength of LEDs is chosen to fit the absorption band of chemical reagents whose colour develops by reaction with soil nutrients. The sensor is applied for detection of six soil nutrients: ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), available phosphorus (P2O 5), available iron (Fe), exchangeable manganese (Mn) and exchangeable calcium (CaO) from colour changes caused by addition of chemical reagent in a transparent plastic cell. The results are compared with those calculated using absorbance of solutions measured by spectrophotometer and good agreement is observed. The resolution of 1.0-20 mg/100 g has been performed for standard solutions of soil nutrients in a cell of 5.5 mm in path length. The sensor is also applied to an analysis of soil nutrients of various farmlands, and the results are compared with those obtained by a colour chart judgment. Â© 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - L-band active and passive sensing of soil moisture through forests
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture under a mature forest canopy by active and passive techniques is discussed. Emphasis is placed on examining the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient and the brightness temperature to soil moisture variations. The effects of the underlying surface roughness of the forest floor on these sensitivities are addressed. The backscattering coefficient from the forest is modeled using the distorted Born approximation. Using this method the backscatter response is decomposed into a direct or volume scattering component, an interaction component between the vegetation and the average surface, an interaction component between the vegetation and the surface fluctuations and finally direct backscatter from the surface attenuated by the vegetation. Peak's method is used to determine the brightness temperature. The models are validated using ground truth and remote sensing data taken during the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) experiment conducted near Rowland, Maine USA in 1990. During this period, the AIRSAR synthetic aperture radar and the Push Broom Microwave Radiometer overflew the Howland area collecting data. Once the model predictions are compared with the passive and active data, the results of a sensitivity analysis involving soil moisture and surface roughness will be presented. Â© 2006 IEEE.

TI  - Progress in soil moisture estimation from remote sensing data for agricultural drought monitoring
VL  - 6366
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the most important indicators for agricultural drought monitoring. In this paper we present a comprehensive review to the progress in remote sensing of soil moisture, with focus on discussion of the method details and problems existing in soil moisture estimation from remote sensing data. Thermal inertia and crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used for soil moisture estimation under bare soil and vegetable environments respectively. Anomaly vegetation index (AVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) are another alternative methods for soil moisture estimation with Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Both NDVI and land surface temperature (LST) are considered in temperature vegetation index (TVI), vegetation supply water index (VSWI) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI). Microwave remote sensing is the most effective technique for soil moisture estimation. Active microwave can provide high spatial resolution but is sensitive to soil rough and vegetation. Passive microwave has a low resolution and revisit frequency but it has more potential for large scale agricultural drought monitoring. Integration of optical/ IR and microwave remote sensing may be the practical method for drought monitoring in both accuracy and in efficiency.

TI  - On-farm evaluation and scaling-up of soil fertility management technologies in western {Kenya
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Low soil fertility is a fundamental constraint to crop production in western Kenya. Although researchers have developed many soil fertility-improving technologies, the adoption of these technologies is low due to inadequate awareness of the technologies, poor access to requisite resources and unsuitability of the technologies to the farmers' conditions. On-farm experiments were conducted during the 2002/2003 long rain cropping seasons in two village clusters in Vihiga and Kakamega Districts in order to: (1) introduce farmers to selected soil fertility-improving options and elicit farmers' evaluation of the options; (2) assess the economics of the selected soil fertility management options under standard farming conditions; (3) compare the farmers' evaluations with the results of an economic assessment. Five treatments were suggested to the farmers and through consensus, they ultimately chose to test three: (1) 5 tons ha-1 FYM (Farm Yard Manure); (2) 60 kg P ha-1 plus 60 kg N ha-1 (chemical fertilizers); (3) 2.5 tons ha-1 FYM plus 30 kg P ha-1 (chemical fertilizers). These were assessed concurrently with farmers' accepted practice, using maize as a test crop. Farmers were involved in the routine management, monitoring and evaluation of the experiments, and field days were held to introduce more farmers to the technologies. The results of this investigation show that the application of 30 kg P plus 2.5 tons FYM ha-1 gave economically viable returns that remained viable even under a projected decline in maize yield and an increase in the price of fertilizers. This treatment was also the most preferred option of the farmers. The results of this study should be used for validation of the promising options and planning of future experiments.

TI  - Incorporating sheep into dryland grain production systems. {III}. {Impact} on changes in soil bulk density and soil nutrient profiles
VL  - 67
SN  - NA
AB  - Changes in soil bulk density and soil nutrient profiles are a major concern of dryland grain producers considering grazing sheep on cereal stubble fields. Our objective was to compare burned, grazed, tilled, trampled and clipped wheat stubble fields on changes in soil bulk density and soil nutrient profiles. Treatments were evaluated in a series of three experiments using a randomized complete block design and four replications at each site. Contrast statements were used to make pre-planned comparisons among treatments. For Experiment 1, treatments were fall tilled, fall grazed, spring grazed, fall and spring combined (Fall/Spr) grazed, and an untreated control. Five mature ewes were confined with electric fence to a 111 m2 plot for 24 h for fall and spring grazed plots resulting in a stocking rate of 452 sheeps d/ha. For Fall/Spr, the stocking rate was 904 sheeps d/ha. For Experiment 2, treatments were fall grazed, fall burned, fall tilled, and an untreated control. In Experiment 3, treatments were fall trampling by sheep, spring trampling by sheep, fall and spring combined (Fall/Spr) trampling by sheep, hand clipping to a stubble height of 4.5 cm, and an untreated control. Trampling treatments were done at the same stocking rates as grazing treatments but sheep were muzzled to prevent intake. In Experiment 1, post-treatment organic matter tended to be greater (P = 0.09) in the mean of the grazed treatments than control plots. In all of the experiments, change in soil bulk density, and soil nutrient profiles did not consistently differ (P {\textgreater} 0.07) among treatments in any manner that would suggest a detrimental impact of grazing sheep on small grain residue. These results indicate a strong potential for grazing sheep on grain stubble without adversely impacting soil bulk density or nutrient profiles. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Appropriate technologies to replenish soil fertility in southern {Africa
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - In southern Africa, soil nutrient reserves are being depleted because of continued nutrient mining without adequate replenishment. The consequent downward spiral of soil fertility has led to a corresponding decline in crop yields, food insecurity, food aid and environmental degradation. The central issue for improving agricultural productivity in southern Africa is how to build up and maintain soil fertility despite the low incomes of smallholder farmers and the increasing land and labour constraints they face. Under this review five main options namely: inorganic fertilizers, grain legumes, animal manures, integrated nutrient management and agroforestry options appropriate to smallholder farmers are presented. Issues addressed in the use of inorganic fertilizers are reduction in fertilizer costs, timely availability and use efficiency. Legumes can be used to diversify farm system productivity but this requires P and lime application to support better legume growth and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) as well as development of markets for various legume products. Manure availability and quality are central issues in increasing smallholder farm productivity and increasing its efficiency through proper handling and application methods. Integrated nutrient management of soil fertility by combined application of both inputs will increase use efficiency of inputs and reduce costs and increase profitability; but the challenge is often how to raise adequate amounts of either inorganic or organic inputs. Issues such as quality of inputs, nutrient balancing, labour to collect and transport organic inputs and their management need to be optimized. These are the challenges of adoption as are the scaling up of these options to millions of small-scale farmers. Â© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Using plant water status to define threshold values for irrigation management of vegetable crops using soil moisture sensors
VL  - 88
SN  - NA
AB  - Thresholds of soil matric potential (SMP) and available soil water content (AWC) required to prevent water limitations between irrigations were determined for bell pepper, melon, and spring and winter tomato grown in Mediterranean-type greenhouses on the south-eastern coast of Spain. Thresholds were identified by measuring the divergence of leaf water potential of un-watered plants from that of well-watered plants. Soil matric potential thresholds were -58 kPa for pepper, -35 kPa for melon, and -38 to -58 kPa for tomato. In general, SMP thresholds were more negative under lower evaporative demand conditions such as during autumn and winter months. Available soil water content thresholds, for a given crop and drying cycle, differed appreciably depending on soil depth and the method used to calculate the values. For the four crops studied, AWC thresholds calculated at 0-40 cm were 13-15\% higher than those calculated at 0-20 cm. Each AWC threshold for 0-20 cm depth was 21-29\% lower when AWC was based on laboratory rather than field determinations of field capacity and permanent wilting point. For a given method of calculating AWC, AWC threshold values were similar for different crops and drying cycles, suggesting limited sensitivity of the AWC approach. Using the manufacturer's calibration, the capacitance sensor used for SWC measurements overestimated SWC by an average of 36\%. An in situ calibration provided generally good agreement with the actual SWC between 0.15 and 0.22 cm3 cm-3; however, for higher SWC values, the in situ calibration underestimated SWC. The results of this study demonstrated the uncertainty of using recommended fixed AWC threshold values for irrigation management, using SWC sensors, because of issues related to the definition of rooting depth, measurement of FC and PWP, sensor calibration, and sensor accuracy across the relevant range of water contents. These data suggest that SMP thresholds are much more reliable than AWC thresholds for scheduling irrigations in greenhouse-grown vegetable crops. Technical issues regarding on-farm measurement of SMP and SWC are discussed. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Available technologies to replenish soil fertility in {East} {Africa
VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Low inherent soil fertility in the highly weathered and leached soils largely accounts for low and unsustained crop yields in most African countries. But in particular, the major nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are commonly deficient in these soils. This scenario of nutrient depletion is reflected in food deficits and hence the food aid received continuously, specifically in sub-Saharan Africa. Undoubtedly, substantial efforts have been made in the continent to replenish the fertility of degraded soils in attempts to raise crop yields, towards self-sufficiency and export. Such efforts consist of applications of both organic and inorganic resources to improve the nutrient status of soils and enhanced nutrient uptake by crops, provided that soil moisture is adequate. Overall, positive crop responses to these materials have been obtained. Thus in the East African region, maize (staple) yields have been raised in one growing season from below 0.5 t/ha without nutrient inputs, to 3-5 t/ha from various nutrient amendments at the smallhold farm level. However, in spite of the positive crop responses to nutrient inputs, farmers are generally slow to adopt the soil fertility management technologies. In this paper we review the impact of some technologies, focussing the use of nutrient resources of different characteristics (qualities) in relation to improved crop yields, with an overall goal to enhance technology adoption. Thus, inorganic resources or fertilizers often give immediate crop responses, but their use or adoption is rather restricted to large-scale farmers who can afford to buy these materials. Organic resources, which include crop residues, water hyacinth and agroforestry shrubs and trees, are widely distributed, but they are generally of low quality, reflecting the need to apply large quantities to meet crop nutrient demands. Moreover, most organics will add N mainly to soils. On the other hand, phosphate rocks of varying reactivity are found widely in Africa and are refined elsewhere to supply soluble P sources. The recently developed soil fertility management options in East Africa have targeted the efficient use of N and P by crops and the integrated nutrient management approach. Some people have also felt that the repackaging of inputs in small, affordable quantities, such as the PREP-PAC described in this paper, may be an avenue to attract smallhold farmers to use nutrient inputs. Nonetheless, crop responses to nutrient inputs vary widely within and across agroecozones (AEZs), suggesting specificity in recommendations. We highlight this observation in a case study whereby eight soil fertility management options, developed independently, are being tested side-by-side at on-farm level. Farmers will be empowered to identify technologies from their own choices that are agronomically effective and economically friendly. This approach of technology testing and subsequent adoption is recommended for technology development in future. Â© 2006 Springer.

TI  - Multi-sensor microwave soil moisture remote sensing: {NASA}'s combined radar/radiometer ({ComRAD}) system
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper describes the development of a ground-based radar/radiometer system called ComRAD. The system under development is an outgrowth of a network analyzer-based L, C, and X band polarimetric radar system developed jointly by NASA/GSFC and the George Washington University. The system is mounted on a 19-m hydraulic boom truck and has provided reliable calibrated radar data in soil moisture field campaigns across the United States since the early 1990's. The truck instrument system is now being upgraded with the addition of a dual polarized 1.4 GHz total power radiometer. The new system includes a temperature monitoring and control system to keep the radiometer at a constant temperature. All front-end components have been placed on an aluminium plate whose temperature stability has been achieved by using Felder cells. Periodic switching to the internal noise sources is used to reduce the influence of gain variations in the output voltage. A novel broadband stacked-patch dual-polarized feed resonates at both the 1.4 GHz radiometer and 1.25 GHz radar frequencies, enabling both the radar and the radiometer to share the same 1.22-m parabolic dish antenna. Having the radar and radiometer utilize the same antenna with the same 12Â° field of view greatly simplifies the development of active/passive microwave retrieval algorithms. With these new capabilities, ComRAD will be an important tool in examining Earth Science research topics such as the synergistic effects between active/passive microwave sensors for soil moisture estimation in the presence of vegetation.

TI  - Electromagnetic scattering from multilayer rough surfaces with arbitrary dielectric profiles for remote sensing of subsurface soil moisture
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Radar remote sensing of soil moisture content at low frequencies requires an accurate scattering model of realistic soils, which often involves multilayer rough surfaces and inhomogeneous dielectric profiles. In this paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to twodimensional scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and transmission matrices of a rough interface are constructed using EBCM. The inhomogeneous dielectric profile is modeled as a stack of piecewise homogeneous dielectric thin layers. The scattering matrices of an inhomogeneous dielectric profile are computed by recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and the inhomogeneous dielectric profile are accounted for by applying the generalized scattering matrix technique. The solution presented in this paper is for the two-dimensional scenario of multilayer rough, surfaces. The technique can also be applied in three dimensions. In numerical simulations, the actual field-collected soil moisture data are used. In particular, the dielectric profiles during both dry and wet ground conditions are examined. The numerical simulations are performed to investigate both backscattering scattering coefficients and copolarized phase difference due to different subsurface roughness parameters and ground conditions. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and co-polarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using co-polarized phase difference than scattering coefficients. Â© 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Stationary {L}-band radiometry for seasonal measurements of soil moisture
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - The results of seasonal L-band (1.4 GHz) soil moisture (SM) measurements and their analysis are described. The measurements were performed using a radiometer mounted at the top of the 300-m tall ETL Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) tower during period of 2004- 2005. In situ soil moisture measurements were made in the center of the radiometer antenna footprint using time-domain reflectometer (TDR) probes installed at 5, 10 and 15 cm depth. Radiative transfer theory predicts that L-band radiation from soil originates from deeper within the soil compared with commonly used remote sensing microwave bands at higher frequencies. Results from this experiment indicate such generally higher sensitivity to subsurface SM content. On the other hand, a significant amount of scattering variability is also observed for the same level of in situ SM measured at 5 cm depth. Our radiometric experiments support the hypothesis that different vertical gradients of SM can lead to different reflectivity values for the same SM level at a fixed depth. Further investigation is needed to quantify the role of grassy vegetation for L-band soil reflectivity during spring and summer seasons.

TI  - On the comparison between soil moisture values retrieved from {SAR} images and ground truth point measurements
VL  - 6363
SN  - NA
AB  - One major concern in the retrieval procedure lies in the procedure for its validation. This procedure implies a comparison between retrieved values and in-situ measurements. Even in the ideal case the ground and satellite measurements are fundamentally different, since the ground data can be sampled continuously in time but at a discrete point, while a satellite samples an area average but a snapshot in time. In this paper a retrieval algorithm for the estimation of soil moisture from AirSAR, acquired on vegetated fields during the SMEX'02 experiment carried out in Iowa in 2002, is presented. The retrieval procedure, based on a Bayesian approach, consists of two modules, one is pertinent to bare soils while the other one is useful for the determination of soil moisture in presence of vegetation. The last one uses the synergy with optical images to correct for the contribution of vegetation water content. The abovementioned campaign has been chosen because, along with radar observations, extensive ground truth measurements were acquired. The main aim of the paper is to investigate how well an average value of the ground variable, such as soil moisture, that is obtained by inverting the satellite data, corresponds to a simple average of the same variable over a finite region determined from ground truth data. This is what happens when satellite derived measurements are compared with point measurements.

TI  - Soil moisture smart sensor web concept using data assimilation and optimal control
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - We present a new concept for a smart sensor web technology for measurements of soil moisture that include spaceborne and in-situ assets. The objective of the technology is to enable a guided/adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the measurement validation objectives of the spaceborne sensors with respect to resolution and accuracy. The sensor nodes are guided to perform as a macro-instrument measuring processes at the scale of the satellite footprint, hence meeting the requirements for the difficult problem of validation of satellite measurements. The science measurement considered is the surface-to-depth profiles of soil moisture estimated from satellite radars and radiometers, with calibration/validation using in-situ sensors. Satellites allow global mapping but with coarse footprints. The total variability in soil-moisture fields comes from variability in processes on various scales. Installing an in-situ network to sample the field for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser but smarter network can provide the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in the context of a data assimilation system. The design and demonstration of the smart sensor web including the control architecture, assimilation framework, and actuation hardware are the building blocks of this concept and will be introduced in the presentation. This technology, once developed, enables a guided/adaptive sampling strategy for generating optimal, statistically unbiased, calibration/validation data for space-based measurements. Â© 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Influence of organic manures on the nutrient uptake and soil fertility of cassava ({Manihot} esculenta {Crantz}.) intercropping systems
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Field experiments were conducted to find out the effect of intercropping and organic manures on the nutrient uptake and soil fertility of cassava intercropping systems at Veterinary College and Research Institute Farm, Namakkal during 2001 and 2002. The popular hybrid of cassava H 226 was tried as test crop. Three intercropping systems viz., sole cassava, cassava + maize (var. African tall) and cassava + cowpea (var. CO 5) were assigned to main plots. Six organic manorial treatments viz., FYM (25 t ha-1), Poultry manure (10 t ha-1), composted poultry manure (10 t ha-1), FYM (12.5 t ha-1) + poultry manure (5 t ha-1), FYM (12.5 t ha-1) + composted poultry manure (5 t ha-1) along with control (no organic manure) were assigned to sub plots. The study revealed that sole cassava had higher uptake of all nutrients (N, P and K) followed by cassava intercropped with cowpea. Among the organic manures, composted poultry manure either alone or with FYM had higher uptake. The depletion of soil nutrients was lesser in sole cassava followed by cassava intercropped with cowpea. Among the organic manures, composted poultry manure recorded higher soil nutrients. The N balance in the systems showed a lesser depletion of soil N due to cowpea intercropping and a higher depletion of soil N due to maize intercropping. Among organic manures, composted poultry manure depleted the soil nutrients, the least. Â© Academic Journals Inc.

TI  - Productivity and soil fertility relationships in rice production systems, {Bangladesh
VL  - 92
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents an econometric analysis of the influence of soil fertility status on productivity and resource use in rice production utilizing survey data from 21 villages in three agro-ecological regions of Bangladesh. Detailed crop husbandry input-output data were collected from 380 paddy rice (Oryza sativa) farmers. Data collected included fertilizer, pesticide, labour, animal power services, irrigation, farm capital assets and rice yield. The soil fertility status in each region was determined by analysis of soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentration. Analysis was based on a profit function, where the selected soil fertility parameters were incorporated as yield controlling variables. Results revealed that soil fertility has a significant influence on both productivity and farmers' resource allocation decisions. Output supply was significantly higher in fertile regions and input use was significantly lower. This observation indicates that in policy terms technological initiatives should be targeted at measures to identify areas of lower soil fertility so that inherent soil-based productivity restrictions can be minimized. In part this will be facilitated by the transfer of indigenous knowledge from farmers in higher productivity areas, thus increasing rice production and raising the competitiveness of Bangladeshi rice farmers.

TI  - Profitability of {Kale} and tomato production under different soil fertility replenishment technologies in {Western} {Kenya
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - A structured questionnaire was administered to 160 farmers from the Kakamega and Vihiga districts of Western Kenya using a purposive random sampling technique to assess the profitability of different soil fertility management strategies for kale and tomato production systems. Different soil fertility amendment technologies including the use of manure, chemical fertilizer and biomass materials, alone and in combination, were compared. Use of farm yard manure alone was considered as a baseline strategy to show the extra costs and returns incurred by farmers if they decided to invest in additional technologies for kale and tomato production. Partial budgets were constructed in order to analyze marginal changes that occur in benefits and costs due to the introduction of improved technology. Kale production was found to be most profitable when grown using a combination of manure and chemical fertilizer to replenish soil fertility. This combination (manure and chemical fertilizer) also yielded the highest marginal rate of return (MRR) of 1,758\% in kale production. In the case of tomato production, the most profitable system is farm yard manure, chemical fertilizer and Tithonia diversifolia biomass transfer, which gave a net return of US\$256 per year per hectare. This shows that it was profitable to shift from use of farm yard manure to a combination of farm yard manure, chemical fertilizer and Tithonia diversifolia biomass transfer. The study thus shows that it is profitable for the farmers to combine farm yard manure and any other soil fertility replenishment strategy in both kale and tomato production. The study thus recommends the need for the farmers to be encouraged to use available and relatively cheap soil fertility replenishment technologies. Further, there is need for the farmers to propagate the Tithonia diversifolia plant on their farms. Â© 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of multiresolution active and passive microwave measurements on soil moisture estimation using the ensemble {Kalman} smoother
VL  - 45
SN  - NA
AB  - An observing system simulation experiment is developed to test tradeoffs in resolution and accuracy for soil moisture estimation using active and passive L-band remote sensing. Concepts for combined radar and radiometer missions include designs that will provide multiresolution measurements. In this paper, the scientific impacts of instrument performance are analyzed to determine the measurement requirements for the mission concept. The ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) is used to merge these multiresolution observations with modeled soil moisture from a land surface model to estimate surface and subsurface soil moisture at 6-km resolution. The model used for assimilation is different from that used to generate "truth." Consequently, this experiment simulates how data assimilation performs in real applications when the model is not a perfect representation of reality. The EnKS is an extension of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in which observations are used to update states at previous times. Previous work demonstrated that it provides a computationally inexpensive means to improve the results from the EnKF, and that the limited memory in soil moisture can be exploited by employing it as a fixed lag smoother. Here, it is shown that the EnKS can be used in large problems with spatially distributed state vectors and spatially distributed multiresolution observations. The EnKS-based data assimilation framework is used to study the synergy between passive and active observations that have different resolutions and measurement error distributions. The extent to which the design parameters of the EnKS vary depending on the combination of observations assimilated is investigated. Â© 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Effects of soil water content during primary tillage - laser measurements of soil surface changes
VL  - 90
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil water content during tillage can have a large impact on soil properties and tillage outcome. Measurement of soil relief in relation to fixed elevation points provides a non-destructive method of monitoring loosening/compacting processes during the year. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of soil water content during primary tillage on soil physical properties. The treatments included mouldboard and chisel ploughing of a clay soil on three occasions in the autumn, with gradually increasing water content (0.76, 0.91 and 1.01 Ã— plastic limit). Soil surface height was measured by laser within a 0.64 m2 area from fixed steel plates after each tillage occasion, and before and after seedbed preparation in the following spring. The measurements of surface height were compared with measurements of other soil physical properties, such as bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and seedbed properties. Tillage at the lowest water content (0.76 Ã— plastic limit) produced the greatest proportion of small aggregates, and generally the most favourable soil conditions for crop growth. Soil loosening, as measured by increase in soil height during primary tillage, was highest for mouldboard ploughing and for tillage at the lowest water content. Differences between tillage treatments decreased with time, but were still significant after sowing in the spring. Natural consolidation during winter was smaller than the compaction during seedbed preparation in the spring. No significant differences in bulk density were found between treatments, and thus soil surface height was a more sensitive parameter than bulk density determined by core sampling to detect differences between treatments. Late tillage under wet conditions caused a greater roughness of the soil surface and the seedbed base, which was also found in the traditional seedbed investigation. The effect of tillage time on seedbed properties also resulted in a lower number of emerged plants in later tillage treatments. The laser measurements were effective for studying changes in soil structure over time. The results emphasize the need to determine changes in soil physical properties for different tillage systems over time in order to model soil processes. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Scintillometer networks for calibration and validation of energy balance and soil moisture remote sensing algorithms
VL  - 6565
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate estimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as soil moisture from remotely sensed satellite images poses a great challenge. Yet, it is critical to face this challenge since the estimation of spatial and temporal distributions of these parameters over large areas is impossible using only ground measurements. A major difficulty for the calibration and validation of operational remote sensing methods such as SEBAL, METRIC, and ALEXI is the ground measurement of sensible heat fluxes at a scale similar to the spatial resolution of the remote sensing image. While the spatial length scale of remote sensing images covers a range from 30 m (LandSat) to 1000 m (MODIS) direct methods to measure sensible heat fluxes such as eddy covariance (EC) only provide point measurements at a scale that may be considerably smaller than the estimate obtained from a remote sensing method. The Large Aperture scintillometer (LAS) flux footprint area is larger (up to 5000 m long) and its spatial extent better constraint than that of EC systems. Therefore, scintillometers offer the unique possibility of measuring the vertical flux of sensible heat averaged over areas comparable with several pixels of a satellite image (up to about 40 Landsat thermal pixels or about 5 MODIS thermal pixels). The objective of this paper is to present our experiences with an existing network of seven scintillometers in New Mexico and a planned network of three scintillometers in the humid tropics of Panama and Colombia.

VL  - 37
SN  - NA
AB  - The purpose of this article was to compare soil phosphorus (P) extraction by sodium bicarbonate solution (Olsen P) and by ammonium lactate (AL P) and to create a model for prediction of Olsen P using ordinary soil-fertility control data. The soils data used in this study included Olsen P, pHKCl, pHH2O, organic matter, AL P, and AL K. Soil pHKCl ranged from 3.5 to 8, organic matter up to 5\%, AL K up to 400 mg kg-1, and AL P up to 200 mg kg-1. Olsen P and AL P were significantly correlated, and the difference between them was influenced by soil pH. Regression models included all soil data grouped by soil pH range, which significantly decreased the difference between predicted and measured Olsen P. The validation of the model was conducted on new data sets from field fertilization trials. The results show that Olsen P can be related to AL P and used for fertilizer recommendations instead of AL P. Copyright Â© Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Adoption of renewable soil fertility replenishment technologies in the southern {African} region: {Lessons} learnt and the way forward
VL  - 31
SN  - NA
AB  - Low soil fertility is one of the most important biophysical constraints to increasing agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Several renewable soil fertility replenishment (RSFR) technologies that are based on nutrient re-cycling principles have been developed in southern Africa. Some success stories have been recorded (e.g. nitrogen-fixing legumes), but the adoption of RSFR technologies has generally lagged behind scientific advances thereby reducing the potential impacts of the technologies. This paper describes the major RSFR technologies being promoted in the region, synthesizes available information regarding their adoption by farmers, and identifies the challenges, key lessons learnt and the way forward for up-scaling RSFR technologies in the region. The review indicated that farmer uptake of RSFR technologies depends on several factors that can be grouped into broad categories: Technology-specific (e.g. soil type, management regime), household-specific (e.g. farmer perceptions, resource endowment, household size), policy and institutions context within which RSFR is disseminated (inputs and output prices, land tenure and property rights), and geo-spatial (performance of species across different bio-physical conditions, location of village). Adoption of RSFR technologies can be enhanced by targeting them to their biophysical and social niches, facilitating appropriate policy and institutional contexts for dissemination, understanding the broader context and dynamics of the adoption process, a paradigm shift in the approach to the dissemination of RSFR (e.g. expanding RSFR to high value crop systems, exploring synergy with inorganic fertilizer) and, targeted incentive systems that encourage farmers to take cognizance of natural resource implications when making agricultural production decisions.

VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - A GIS framework, the Army Remote Moisture System (ARMS), has been developed to link the Land Information System (LIS), a high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation system, with remotely sensed measurements of soil moisture to provide a high resolution estimation of soil moisture in the near surface. ARMS uses available soil (soil texture, porosity, Ksat), land cover (vegetation type, LAI, Fraction of Greenness), and atmospheric data (Albedo) in standardized vector and raster GIS data formats at multiple scales, in addition to climatological forcing data and precipitation. PEST (Parameter EStimation Tool) was integrated into the process to optimize soil porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), using the remotely sensed measurements, in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the soil moisture. The modeling process is controlled by the user through a graphical interface developed as part of the ArcMap component of ESRI ArcGIS.

TI  - In situ comparison of three dielectric soil moisture sensors in drip irrigated sandy soils
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - The number of different sensors available for measuring soil water content has increased since the introduction of time domain reflectometry (TDR). In this study the performances of the CS616 (Campbell Scientific, Ltd., Shepshed, UK) sensor and the Aquaflex (Streat Instruments., Ltd, Christchurch, NZ) sensor were compared with TDR using both vertically and horizontally installed sensors. It was found that the CS616 manufacturer's standard calibration needed to be linearly transformed, y = 0.59x + 0.01 (m 3 m -3), to obtain accurate measurements in a sandy soil with horizontally installed probes. In two different soils the standard calibration performed better, and smaller corrections were found, y = 0.87x - 0.01 for a sandy loam and y = 0.96x - 0.001 (m 3 m -3) for a sandy loam with a larger clay content, respectively. The CS616 sensor was most likely affected by electrical conductivity at 1.6 dS m 1 in the soil solution when measuring in drip-fertigated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). In the period of fertigation, the sensor overestimated the soil water content in the sandy soil by 0.01 to 0.11 m 3 m -3 compared with TDR measurements. The dynamic response of the vertically installed sensor to changes in soil water content was shown to be good, and the sensor may be useful for assessing threshold values in water content for the start and end of irrigation. The performance of the Aquaflex sensor was investigated in the sandy soil only, and the sensor was found to reflect the dynamics of soil water content well. However, the manufacturer's standard calibration underestimated the soil water content in the order of 0.10 m 3 m -3 and even showed negative values. Â© Soil Science Society of America.

Two soil water content profile measurement methods were used and compared to determine the timing and amount of irrigation of three winter cover crops (Avena sativa, Secale cereale and Lolium multiflorum): the PR1 profile probe dielectric and Diviner 2000 capacitance methods. The laboratory-measured retentivity relationship was used to define the fill (0.39 m3 mâˆ’3) and high refill point (0.34 m3 mâˆ’3). Soil water content was measured two to three times per week starting from 50 days after planting (DAP) until 164 DAP. After the last rainfall event of 8 mm (142 DAP), the next irrigation was predicted graphically using the PR1 measurements to be five days later and seven days for the Diviner 2000. This difference occurred since the Diviner 2000-measured soil water contents at the rooting depth were slightly higher than those obtained using the PR1 method. The amount of irrigation estimated using graphical and mathematical methods were in good agreement. Â© 2006, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - An observing system simulation experiment for hydros radiometer-only soil moisture and freeze-thaw products
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - An important issue in the development of a dedicated space borne soil moisture sensor has been concern over the reliability of soil moisture retrievals in densely vegetated areas and the global extent over which retrievals will be possible. Errors in retrieved soil moisture can originate from a variety of sources within the measurement and retrieval process. In addition to instrument error, three key contributors to retrieval error are the masking of the soil microwave signal by vegetation, the interplay between nonlinear retrieval physics and the relatively poor spatial resolution of space borne sensors, and retrieval parameter uncertainty. Quantification of these errors requires the realistic specification of land surface soil moisture heterogeneity and spatial vegetation patterns. Since detailed soil moisture patterns are currently difficult to obtain from direct observations, an attractive alternative is the application of an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which simulated land surface states are propagated through the sensor measurement and retrieval process to investigate and constrain expected levels of retrieval error. This manuscript describes results from an OSSE designed out to simulate the impact of land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and retrieval parameter uncertainty on radiometer-only soil moisture products derived from the NASA ESSP Hydrosphere State (Hydros) mission.

TI  - Effects of soil management practices on soil fertility measurements on {Agave} tequilana plantations in {Western} {Central} {Mexico
VL  - 87
SN  - NA
AB  - Agaves have historically been an important crop in the Western Central Highlands of Mexico, used for food, livestock fodder and beverage production. The best known of these products, and one of the most financially significant, is the distilled spirit, Tequila. The success of agaves in this region has been attributed, in part, to unique environmental adaptations. Agaves used for production of the distilled spirit Tequila (Blue agave) have also been considered to have a minimal impact on soil fertility because they are harvested only every 6-10 years. In the past 20 years, with the rising global consumption of Tequila, cultivation of Blue agaves has grown more intense, prompting questions regarding the impact of commercial practices on soil quality. Researchers on related agave species have shown the potential for severe nutrient depletion and subsequent declines in yield in the absence of proper soil fertility management. This study examined the key physical and chemical indicators of soil fertility and how they were affected by tillage, the amendment of soils with distillery effluent, and the grazing of livestock. It was found that tillage decreased soil carbon levels along with nutrients associated with organic matter; mean levels of 2.44\% C, 0.20\% N and 10.99 mg P/kg soil were found on untilled sites compared with 1.29\% C, 0.10\% N and 3.53 mg P/kg soil for tilled sites. The addition of distillery effluent was found to increase soil cation levels (mean soil K, Mg, and Ca were 436.50, 364.40 and 1416.2 mg/kg on amended sites versus 299.50, 228.36 and 1013.5 mg/kg on non-amended sites) while livestock grazing had only a small effect on nutrient levels. The effects of tillage and livestock grazing need to be addressed by proper soil fertility management strategies need to be addressed to insure the long term health of soils in the region.

TI  - Soil fertility distributions in long-term no-till, chisel/disk and moldboard plow/disk systems
VL  - 88
SN  - NA
AB  - In permanent no-till (NT), soil nutrients are no longer mixed into the topsoil as with moldboard plow/disking (MD), whereas chisel/disking (CD) does limited mixing. Surface broadcast and/or banded nutrient applications may result in high and low fertility zones in permanent NT, with possible implications for soil sampling and nutrient placement. We investigated effects of 25 years of continuous NT, CD and MD with corn planted in the same row locations on organic matter (SOM), pH-H2O and Mehlich-3 extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Vertical distribution at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm depths was measured as well as horizontal distributions across corn rows. We observed higher SOM and P in NT and CD than in MD in the 0-15 cm layer. SOM content was greatest in the top 5 cm in NT, but declined sharply with depth. SOM content in CD was not as high at the surface as in NT, but did not decline as fast as in NT. SOM was uniform but low throughout the 0-15 cm depth of MD. In all tillage systems, SOM did not vary across rows. Soil pH was higher in the 0-5 cm layer of NT than the deeper layers but the reverse was true in the CD or MD treatments. Concentrations of P, K and Ca were higher in the surface 0-5 cm than 10-15 cm depth of all tillage systems, but most strikingly in NT and CD. Starter fertilizer injection resulted in higher P and lower pH in the injection zone of all tillage treatments, but most notably in NT. The pH was depressed under the band of side-dressed nitrogen with all tillage systems. Potassium accumulated in the rows of the previous crop, probably because it leached from crop residue that accumulated there. Tillage did not affect Mg distribution. Optimal nutrient management in NT should take account of horizontal and vertical nutrient and pH distributions. Samples in long-term NT could potentially be taken to a shallower depth if calibration curves are available. To avoid underestimating P and K availability or overestimate lime needs, high P or decreased pH bands should be avoided, as well as crop rows. Possibilities to reduce P and K applications with banding need more investigation. Results show the importance of regular liming in NT to maintain surface pH in the optimum range, but also show that lime does not have to be incorporated. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A soil moisture retrieval technique based on the semi-empirical scattering model for {HH}-, {HV}-, and {VV}-polarized radar observations
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for retrieval of soil moisture content from hh-, hv-, and vv-polarized radar observation using a genetic algorithm with the semi-empirical polarimetric scattering model for bare soil surfaces. The semiempirical polarimetric scattering model was developed empirically based on an extensive database comprising the polarimetric radar measurements using the ground-based scatterometers and the JPL airborne synthetic aperture radar (AirSAR) system. The input parameters of the scattering model are the volumetric soil moisture content, the rms height, the correlation length, incident angle, and radar frequency. The outputs of the scattering model are vv-, hh-, hv-polarized backscattering coefficients as well as the phase parameters of the degree of correlation and the co-polarized phase-difference. The inversion technique in this study is based on a genetic algorithm. The vv-, hh- and hv-polarized backscattering coefficients are used as the cost function of the Genetic algorithm. The outputs of the inversion model are the soil moisture and the rms surface height. One of main objectives of this study is to optimize the cost function with appropriate combination of three polarization data. The inversion model is verified by comparing the inverted results with in-situ measurement data. Â© 2005 IEEE.

TI  - Does farmer participatory research matter for improved soil fertility technology development and dissemination in {Southern} {Africa
VL  - 4
SN  - NA
AB  - Crop management research is increasingly involving farmers in evaluating new technologies, identifying adoption constraints and opportunities for improving farm performance to produce more sustainable impact. ICRISAT and its partners worked with farmers in Malawi and Zimbabwe during the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 seasons to evaluate a range of â€˜best betâ€™ soil fertility and water management technologies and evaluate the impact of farmer participatory research. Although there was some variation in methods implemented at different sites, the study found that there is a basis for a comparison of methods. Community entry and participatory approaches that engage farmers in decision making throughout the research-development-diffusion-innovation process have higher setup costs compared to traditional â€˜top-downâ€™ approaches. But they improve efficiency, both in technology development and in building farmers' capacity for experimentation and collective learning. This results in the development of more relevant technologies, joint learning among farmers, researchers and extensionists and better impact. To make farmer participatory research projects more sustainable and introduce them on a wide scale, the study recommends that public and NGO investments be targeted to building district and village-level innovation clusters.

TI  - Development of the {RF} soil moisture sensors
VL  - 6167
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate measurements of soil water content are important to land activities, especially those involving agriculture, forestry, hydrology, and engineering. In this paper, a theoretical and experimental study of the microwave moisture measurement sensors is conducted. A phase-based moisture sensor system using a transmission line sensor is designed. The amplitude of the transmission measurement is a strong function of the conductivity (loss of the media) and the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, and the phase is mainly a strong function of the real part of the dielectric constant. One can obtain the soil moisture information from measuring the phase shift of the transmitted waves. Microstrip resonator sensors are also studied and fabricated. The effective permittivity will change if a dielectric material is present near the substrate of the resonator, which causes the shift of the resonant frequency. The measured data show that both sensors are sensitive and accurate.

AB  - Full title. Small-Scale Spatial Variability of Soil Nutrients and Vegetation Properties in Semi-Arid Northern China1 1 Project supported by the National Key Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China (No. 2002CB111506), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. KZCX3-SW-418), and the National Programs for Science and Technology Development of China (No. 2005BA517A03). A field experiment was conducted at Kezuohouqi County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, which was located on the southeastern edge of the Horqin Sandy Land, to study the spatial variability of soil nutrients for a small-scale, nutrient-poor, sandy site in a semi-arid region of northern China; to investigate whether or not there were "islands of fertility" at the experimental site; and to determine the key nutrient elements that sustained ecosystem stability. Results obtained from geostatistical analysis indicated that the spatial distribution pattern of soil total nitrogen (STN) was far different from those of soil organic matter (SOM), total phosphorus (STP), and total potassium (STK). Compared to SOM, STP, and STK, STN had a lower structural heterogeneity ratio and a longer range, while other elements were all similar. In addition, STN had an isotropic spatial structure, whereas the others had an anisotropic spatial structure. The spatial structure patterns of herbage species, cover, and height also differed, indicating that spatial variability was subjected to different ecological factors. Differences in the spatial variability patterns among soil nutrients and vegetation properties showed that soil nutrients for a small-scale were not the primary limiting factors that influenced herbage spatial distribution patterns. Incorporating spatial distribution patterns of tree species, namely, Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv. and shrub Lespedeza bicolor Turcz. in a research plot and using fractal dimension, SOM, STP, and STK were shown to contribute to the "islands of fertility" phenomenon, however STN was not, possibly meaning that nitrogen was a key limiting element. Therefore, during restoration of similar ecosystems more attention should be given to soil nitrogen. Â© 2006 Soil Science Society of China.

TI  - Adding a soil fertility dimension to the global farming systems approach, with cases from {Africa
VL  - 116
SN  - NA
AB  - The global farming systems (GFS) approach is extended by adding a soil fertility and nutrient management dimension for Africa's forest-based, maize mixed, cereal-root crop mixed, and agro-pastoral millet/sorghum farming systems. Use is made of sustainable livelihood concepts, translated into farmer capitals (natural, physical, financial, human, social), and the indicator-based DPSIR (driving force-pressure-state-impact-response) framework for environmental reporting. State and impact indicators show, for each GFS, levels of nutrient stocks and flows, respectively. In case of nutrient depletion, soils may (i) initially still be fertile enough to provide reasonable and stable yields, (ii) support declining yields, or (iii) support low yields at low fertility level. In the latter case, food security is generally at stake. Response indicators include the level of uptake of improved integrated nutrient management strategies at land user level, and the enforcement of new and enabling pro-agriculture and pro-environment policies. Although the extended GFS have no direct relevance for farm-level interventions, the approach can be used to frame soil fertility research priorities and policies at a regional level.

VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important indication of monitoring land degradation and drought, and is a critical component of climate, hydrology, ecology and agriculture systems. Understanding how soil moisture varies across the field is important for planning and management of those systems. Compared with traditional methods, the rapid developing methods of using remote sensing techniques have many advantages. In this paper, the developments, as well as the theories and methods of soil moisture monitoring and retrieving by remote sensing are summarized. A review on the study keys and development directions in the field of soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing is carried out. This paper mainly refers the theories and methods by using hyper spectrum data and microwave data, which are becoming mature and general used. A conclusion can be concluded that without the support of the assistant soil moisture data from observation and measurement, it is very difficult even impossible to retrieve the accurate value of surface moisture status only by remote sensing data.

TI  - Assessment of soil nutrient depletion and its spatial variability on smallholders' mixed farming systems in {Ethiopia} using partial versus full nutrient balances
VL  - 108
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil fertility depletion in smallholder farms is one of the fundamental biophysical causes for declining per capita food production in Ethiopia. In the present study, we assess soil nutrient depletion and its spatial variability for Ethiopia and its regional states, using nutrient balances as a tool. Data on crop production, fertilizer use and land management practices were collected from the Agricultural sample survey, which was carried out by the Central Statistics Authority (CSA) for the production year 1999/2000. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to process, and analyze spatially referenced information like soil properties, precipitation and land use types. We calculated nutrient balances for N, P and K from five nutrient fluxes entering and five nutrient fluxes leaving cultivated lands of smallholders. Some of the fluxes (e.g. leaching, denitrification and wet deposition) were estimated using transfer functions. Erosion was estimated by universal soil loss equation (USLE) and landscape process modelling at multi-dimensions and scales (LAPSUS). At the national level, full nutrient balance results indicate a depletion rate of 122 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 13 kg P ha-1 yr-1 and 82 kg K ha-1 yr-1. Soil nutrient stocks in all regional states were decreasing with the exception of areas under permanent and vegetable crops. In the analysis, soil erosion was the major cause for nutrients depletion, but this flux shows significant variability between different estimates and was highly uncertain. We calculated that the contribution of erosion to N losses was 70\%, while its contribution to P and K losses were 80\% and 63\%, respectively. Nutrient losses under permanent and vegetable cropping were caused mainly by residues removal, harvested products and leaching, while losses under cereals and other annuals were dominated by erosion.

TI  - Soil fertility in three cropping systems after conversion from conventional to organic farming
VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Temporal changes in the scores of selected soil fertility indices were studied over six years in three different cases of organic crop rotation located in southern, eastern and central Norway. The cropping history and the initial scores of fertility indices prior to conversion to organic cropping differed between the sites. Crop yields, regarded as an overall, integrating fertility indicator, were in all rotations highly variable with few consistent temporal trends following the first year after conversion. On the site in eastern Norway, where conversion followed several years of all-arable crop rotations, earthworm number and biomass and soil physical properties improved, whereas the system was apparently degrading with regard to P and K trade balances and contents in soil. On the other two sites, the picture was less clear. On the southern site, which had a relatively fertile soil before conversion, the contents of soil organic matter and K decreased during the six-year period, but the scores of other fertility indices showed no trends. On the site in central Norway, there were positive trends for earthworm-related indices such as worm biomass and tubular biopores, and negative trends for soil porosity. The results, especially those from the eastern site, illustrate the general difficulty in drawing conclusions about overall fertility or sustainability when partial indicators show divergent trends. Consequently, the study gave no unambiguous support to the initial working hypothesis that organic farming increases inherent overall soil fertility, but rather showed that the effect varied among indicators and depended on status of the cases at conversion. It is concluded that indicators are probably better used as tools to learn about and improve system components than as absolute measures of sustainability. Â© 2006 Taylor \& Francis.

TI  - Modelling the long-term productivity and soil fertility of maize/millet cropping systems in the mid-hills of {Nepal
VL  - 111
SN  - NA
AB  - Finding ways of maintaining or increasing crop yields without degrading soil fertility is an important goal in sustaining livelihoods in many parts of the world. In the mid-hills of Nepal, the problem is of particular importance due to the fragility of mountain ecosystems. Previously reported field experiments have investigated the influence of different combinations of inorganic fertilisers and farmyard manure (FYM) on crop yields in maize/millet cropping systems at two sites in this region, Pakhribas and Dordor Gaun, but due to the short-time period involved (three years), long-term trends in crop yields could not be determined, neither could changes in soil carbon and nitrogen levels be measured. In this paper, we describe the use of the PALM simulation model to address these questions, and its parameterisation and validation based on data from the field experiments. Using weather data generated for 100 years at each site, the model was then used to investigate the effect of different nutrient management treatments on long-term trends in crop yields and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Overall, crop yields were higher at Pakhribas than Dordor Gaun, due both to the lower temperatures causing slower crop development and hence a longer period of biomass accumulation, and to the higher inherent soil nutrient status causing faster crop growth rates. At both sites, the highest crop yields were obtained in the treatment receiving only inorganic fertiliser at a rate of 90 kg N ha-1. Declines in soil organic C and N were predicted for all fertiliser and FYM treatments, with the severest rates of loss in the treatment receiving no nutrient inputs at all and the slowest rates of loss in the treatment receiving 7 t ha-1 of organic manure. Economic analysis showed that, at current prices, the use of inorganic fertilisers was by far the most rational option for farmers in terms of net returns, regardless of the site, and despite the associated decline in soil C and N levels. It was estimated that if greater use of organic manure is to be promoted as a way of increasing carbon sequestration in the soil, then farmers in the mid-hills of Nepal will need to be compensated at a rate of at least US\$9.90 (t C)-1 for the lower crop yields they will obtain.

TI  - 2.{4GHz} on-board parallel plate soil moisture sensor system
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Moisture content measurements are very important to the evaluation and maintenance of highway pavements. Such applications require sensors can provide relative long time, continuous, and accurate measurements in hostile pavement environments. And sensors should be in contact with soils, concrete, asphalt or other pavement material. In this paper, a 2.4GHz integrated parallel-plate soil moisture sensor system is presented. The moisture sensor is based on the principle that the phase shift in the transmission line is the function of medium dielectric constant, which is related to the moisture content. Compared with other methods like TDR and microstrip resonator, the phase shift detection method has better performance for these applications. Detailed sensor head design is based on the consideration of sensitivity, linearity, impedance match, dynamic range and power plane requirement. The solution is fully digital with integrated RF synthesizer, micro-controller, phase detection circuitry, baseband signal processing circuits, and digital communication protocol. The system calibration is built in the software program. The power management system reduces power consumption. The sensor network is able to handle as much as 256 sensors with single pair RS485 interface. Copyright 2005 by ISA - The Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society.

TI  - The study of the combining finite element with genetic algorithms method for soil moisture
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - In order to improve inversion accuracy for soil moisture, deepen the research on quantitative soil moisture, a method, which combines finite element with Genetic Algorithms, is proposed in this paper. The soil moisture in studied area can be acquired by using the method. Affected by atmosphere rainfall, irrigation and wind speed and so on, there exists complex material and energy exchange on the interface of atmosphere and soil, which leads to very complex boundary conditions of moisture flow equation. Then, Genetic Algorithms are applied to calculating the boundary conditions of moisture flow equation. The initial conditions of moisture flow equation are obtained by remote sensing technique: the surface soil moisture is reversed by apparent thermal inertial method, whose reversed results are considered as the initial conditions of soil moisture flow equation. Finally, the finite element method is applied to resolving the moisture flow equation. The monitoring of soil moisture is fulfilled. Thus the method combines remote sensing technique and monitoring soil moisture means at the same time so that the dynamic monitoring soil moisture can be fulfilled in the area. The method is applied to monitoring soil moisture in the working area of west Inner-Mongolia. The result shows that method is feasible. Â© 2005 IEEE.

TI  - Research on remote sensing model for soil water content on rough surface
VL  - 6
SN  - NA
AB  - Roughness of soil surface not only performs a remarkable influence to the BRDF of ground, and it is variable as well. So it's one of important factors that affect the precision of remote sensing for soil water content. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the relationship between soil reflected spectrum and the soil water content is about obey the Beer Law, and then the absorption coefficient curve of moisture in soil was measured. The conclusion also be reached that the essential cause of soil surface roughness effects the soil reflectance is the slant of sub slopes on clod surface which result in the increasing of the rate of multi-reflecting light. Through analyzing the physical process of soil surface reflecting under the inference of soil water, a geometrical BRDF model for soil water remote sensing on rough surface is put forward in this paper. The result of test data showed that the model has a satisfied precision. Â© 2005 IEEE.

TI  - Chemical characterization of soil phosphorus and organic matter in different cropping systems in {Maine}, {U}.{S}.{A
VL  - 105
SN  - NA
AB  - To minimize purchased inputs, sustainable agriculture systems often use green- or animal-manure as a nitrogen source for crops. The addition of these materials also have positive impacts on soil phosphorus (P) availability. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of animal- and legume-based cropping systems in place for 5-13 years on the chemistry of organic matter and soil P. Two cropping systems, Potato Ecosystem (ECO) located in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. and Grass Fertility (GF) located in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. received animal manure. Two others, Liebman E Rotation (LER) in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. and Porter Rotation (PR) in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. were primarily legume-based rotations. Estimated difference in carbon input (ha-1 year -1) between the amended and control plots were: ECO, 8100 kg C; GF, 1010 kg; LER, 950 kg C; and PR, 415 kg C. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was higher (P {\textless} 0.10) in the treatment that received animal manure than those which only received legume residue. The E2/E3 spectrophotometric test indicated that the DOC extracted from the ECO manure-treated plots was more humified than that from the ECO control plots. There were no significant differences between the amended and control treatments in Olsen P or total P for all the tested cropping systems. Similar to that of the DOC response, the ECO cropping system that received animal manure recorded higher concentrations of water soluble P (P {\textless} 0.05). There was a linear relationship between DOC and water-soluble P concentrations of the soil:water extract across soils, indicating a positive relationship between them. To determine the effects of the different cropping systems on P bioavailability, a simulation model was used to study how changes in P soil chemistry may affect P uptake by crops. The simulation runs showed that predicted P uptake was greater for the animal manure based ECO and GF systems, but not for the legume based LER and PR systems (P {\textless} 0.05). This study shows that cropping systems that include animal manure may increase soil P availability. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long-term effects of fallow systems and lengths on crop production and soil fertility maintenance in {West} {Africa
VL  - 71
SN  - NA
AB  - In the development of short fallow systems as alternatives to shifting cultivation in West Africa, a long-term trial was established at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on an Alfisol in the forest-savanna transitional zone of southwestern Nigeria, comparing three fallow systems; natural regrowth fallow, cover crop fallow and alley cropping on soil productivity and crop yield sustainability. The natural fallow system consisted of natural regrowth of mainly Chromolaena odorata shrub as fallow vegetation. The cover crop fallow system consisted of Pueraria phaseoloides, a herbaceous legume as fallow vegetation. The alley cropping system consisted of woody hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala as fallow vegetation. The fallow lengths were 0 (continuous cropping), 1, 2 and 3 years after 1 year of maize/cassava intercropping. Biomass produced from natural fallow and cover crop fallow was burnt during the land preparation. Fertilizer was not applied throughout the study. Without fertilizer application, maize yield declined from above 3.0 t ha-1 to below 0.5 t ha-1 during 12 years of cultivation (1989-2000) on a land cleared from a 23-year old secondary forest. Temporal change in cassava tuber yield was erratic. Mean maize grain yields from 1993-2000 except for 1999 were higher in cover crop fallow system (1.89 t ha-1) than in natural fallow system (1.73 t ha-1), while natural fallow system outperformed alley cropping system (1.46 t ha -1). During the above 7 years, mean cassava tuber yield in cover crop system (7.7 t ha-1) did not differ from natural fallow system (8.2 t ha-1), and both systems showed higher cassava tuber than the alley cropping system (5.7 t ha-1). The positive effect of fallowing on crop yields was observed for both crops in the three systems, however, insignificant effects were seen when fallow length exceeded 1 year for cover crop and alley cropping, and 2 years for natural fallow. Soil pH, organic carbon, available P and exchangeable Ca, Mg and K decreased considerably after 12 years of cultivation, even in a 3-year fallow subplot. After 12 years, soil organic carbon (SOC) within 0-5 cm depth in alley cropping (13.9 g kg -1) and natural fallow (13.7 g kg-1) was higher than in cover crop fallow (11.6 g kg-1). Whereas significant increase in SOC with either natural fallow or alley cropping was observed only after 2 or 3 years of fallow, the SOC in the 1-year fallow alley cropping subplot was higher than that in continuous cropping natural fallow subplot. It can be concluded from our study that in transforming shifting cultivation to a permanent cropping, fallow with natural vegetation (natural fallow), herbaceous legumes (cover crop fallow) and woody legumes (alley cropping) can contribute to the maintenance of crop production and soil fertility, however, length of fallow period does not need to exceed 2 years. When the fallow length is reduced to 1 year, a better alternative to natural regrowth fallow would be the cover crop for higher maize yield and alley cropping for higher soil organic matter. For fallow length of 2 years, West African farmers would be better off with the natural fallow system. Â© Springer 2005.

TI  - Reducing soil erosion and the loss of soil fertility for environmentally-sustainable agricultural cropping and livestock production systems
VL  - 146
SN  - NA
AB  - My proposals for reducing soil erosion are based on my experience of assessing erosion, largely in Britain, both of cultivated land and of upland grazings. I have assessed the extent and rates of erosion in the field mostly by using easily- and rapidly-used photographic and measurement techniques, rather than by using experimental plots set up either in the field or laboratory which overstate erosion. Policies which have governed the economics of agricultural production have also been examined. Much of the increase in occurrence of runoff and soil erosion in Britain is due to changes in land use and in intensity of use since the Agriculture Act was passed in 1947, and especially since joining the Common Market in 1973, with its even greater emphasis on paying for increased production. The increasing numbers of animals grazing the land, especially sheep, led to the initiation and erosion of bare soil in the uplands and to trampling and puddling of soils in lowland pastures. There is evidence that runoff from the land, and sedimentation of water courses have also increased. In the cultivated lowlands, the expansion in area of land drilled to winter cereals, the increase in area of land sown to maize or used to rear outdoor pigs, changes in farming techniques, and larger machines working in larger fields can explain much of the increase in erosion. Reversing some of these changes, for example by lowering the intensity of grazing and inserting grass (set-aside) into the arable rotation will reduce the extent of erosion. Other techniques to reduce erosion are well-known but need national and international agricultural policies that improve farmers' incomes to bring them into use. In developed countries, erosion need not reduce soil fertility, as nutrients removed from the soil by animals or crops can be affordably replaced. This may not be so in other parts of the world. Education of farmers also has a vital role to play in persuading them to use the land more sustainably, for many of the impacts of erosion such as flooding and pollution of water supplies bear on society as a whole, not just farmers who are themselves little affected. The principles devised to reduce erosion in developed countries are likely to be successful in developing countries. However, it may take many years for better and more sustainable agricultural policies at national and international level to be devised and brought into being.

TI  - Effects of fallow duration on soil phosphorus fractions and crop {P} uptake under natural regrowth and planted {Pueraria} phaseoloides fallow systems in {Southwestern} {Nigeria
VL  - 41
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil phosphorus fractions, maize and cassava P uptakes in natural regrowth fallow and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow systems, as affected by the duration (1-3 years) of fallow, were assessed in 1998 and 1999 in a long-term fallow management trial, established in 1989 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. After one and three years fallow respectively, the mean P accumulation in fallow vegetation was 4.2 and 9.4 kg ha-1 in 1998, and 8.9 and 12.1 kg ha-1 in 1999 for natural fallow. For Pueraria, the corresponding values were 6.3 and 7.4 kg ha-1 in 1998 and 6.1 and 13.5 kg ha-1 in 1999. The positive effects of fallow lengths on dry matter and P accumulation were not as pronounced under Pueraria. Continuous cropping reduced soil pH and depleted Olsen P more than crop-fallow rotations under both fallow systems. An increase in fallow duration enhanced the availability of resin P, NaHCO3-, and NaOH-extractable P fractions, especially under natural fallow. Continuous cropping in a natural fallow system resulted in lower resin inorganic P (Pi) and NaHCO 3-extractable inorganic and organic P (Po) fractions, and higher refractory P fractions (concentrated HCl-extractable Pi and Po and residual P) as compared to crop-fallow rotations. Although continuous cropping in the Pueraria system resulted in higher refractory P fractions than the crop-fallow rotations, the effects of fallow length on P fractions were not consistent or pronounced. Maize and cassava P uptakes increased with fallow duration. Phosphorous in maize grain was positively correlated with fallow vegetation P accumulation. Total P uptake by maize was positively but weakly correlated with NaHCO3-Po, Olsen P and fallow vegetation P accumulation.

TI  - Sensitivity of satellite microwave and infrared observations to soil moisture at a global scale: {Relationship} of satellite observations to in situ soil moisture measurements
VL  - 110
SN  - NA
AB  - This study presents a systematic and integrated analysis of the sensitivity of the available satellite observations to in situ soil moisture measurements. Although none of these satellites is optimized for land surface characterization, before the launches of the SMOS- and HYDROS-dedicated missions they are the only potential sources of global soil moisture measurements. The satellite observations include passive microwave emissivities, active microwave scatterometer data, and infrared estimates of the diurnal amplitude of the surface skin temperature. The Global Soil Moisture Data Bank provides in situ soil moisture measurements in five separate regions. This simultaneous analysis of various satellite observations and the large amount of in situ measurements has two major advantages. First, this analysis helps identify and separate the physical mechanisms that affect the satellite observations. For example, we show that the passive microwave polarization differences at 19 GHz and above are essentially sensitive to the vegetation and not to the soil moisture (i.e., the correlation between microwave observations and soil moisture is only indirect and comes from the statistical correlation between vegetation and soil moisture). Second, this analysis enables an objective comparison of the relative potential of the various satellite observations for soil moisture retrieval when other conditions are held constant. The second part of this study benefits from this synthesis to derive a relationship between satellite observations and soil moisture at a global scale.

TI  - Frequency domain analyses of {TDR} waveforms for soil moisture measurements
VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - When time domain reflectometry (TDR) is applied to the field characterization of soil moisture, the waveforms have typically been analyzed using traveltime along the waveguide. The apparent dielectric constant traditionally determined by the traveltime analysis using a tangent-line method does not have a clear physical meaning and is influenced by several system and material parameters. The frequency domain analysis, however, can determine the actual frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity and can be performed using a very short probe. This study presents a numerical modeling approach for common unmatched TDR probes to analyze the TDR signals in the frequency domain. This approach is also adopted to examine how dielectric relaxation, and electrical conductivity affect traveltime analysis. Simulation results indicated that, although the effects of TDR bandwidth and probe length could be quantified and calibrated, the calibration equation for soil moisture measurements was still affected by dielectric relaxation and electrical conductivity, due to differences in soil texture and density. The effects of density can be removed by adding a density term to the calibration equation. Correlating with water content the dielectric permittivity at frequencies between 500 MHz and 1 GHz, rather than the apparent dielectric constant, can minimize the influence of soil texture.

TI  - Long-term changes in soil fertility in organic arable farming systems in {England}, with particular reference to phosphorus and potassium
VL  - 105
SN  - NA
AB  - Organic farming has undergone significant expansion in Europe over the last decade and it is often seen as a sustainable alternative to intensive agricultural systems. If it is to be truly sustainable, it must maintain levels of soil fertility sufficient for economic crop production in the long-term, whilst also protecting the environment. This paper presents results comparing soils managed organically for at least 15 years, with soils under conventional management, on four arable farms in England. There were no significant differences in total soil organic matter, total nitrogen or C:N ratio between the conventionally and organically managed soils. However, concentrations of extractable potassium and phosphorus were significantly lower in soils managed organically. The largest difference between the conventional and organic fields in potassium concentration was on the oldest organic farm. These results support the argument that organic mixed arable systems are mining reserves of potassium and phosphorus, built up during conventional management, and that changes to organic management practices to increase inputs of potassium and phosphorus are required, if long-term declines in soil fertility, and thus, yields are to be avoided.

AB  - This study introduces a framework for forecasting soil nitrogen content, leveraging multi-modal data, including multi-sensor remote sensing images and advanced machine learning methods. We integrate the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database, which covers European and UK territory, with environmental variables from satellite sensors to create a dataset of novel features. We further test a broad range of machine learning algorithms, focusing on tree-based models such as CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost. We test the proposed methods with a variety of land cover classes, including croplands and grasslands to ensure the the robustness of this approach. Our results demonstrate that CatBoost model surpasses other methods in accuracy. This research not only advances the field of agricultural management and environmental monitoring but also demonstrates the significant potential of integrating multisensor remote sensing data with machine learning for environmental analysis.

A total of 165 soil samples were obtained from the field and analyzed their spectra features. 135 samples spectra were used during the calibration and cross-validation stage, 30 samples spectra were used to predict N, P, K and OM concentration. NIR spectra and constituents were related using partial least square regression (PLSR) technique. The r between measured and predicted values of N and OM, were 0.92 and 0.93 respectively, demonstrated that NIRS have potential to predict accurately this constituents in this soil, not being this way in the prediction of P and K with r, 0.48 and 0.68 respectively, demonstrated a poorly for P and a less successfully for K prediction. The result also shows that NIR could be a good tool to be combined with precision farming application.

The surface reflection method of GPR can be used to monitoring soil water content at the scale between point scale of traditional methods and the large scale of remote sensing methods. In this study the controlling condition experiment and field experiment were carried out for the surface reflection method of GPR. In order to better retrieve soil water content of the surface 5cm soil layer, we used a empirical equationÎ¸ - R, and the empirical equation here used was regressed by the data of controlling condition experiment. In the preliminary field experiment, the empirical equation performed well. Much work was still required to support the need of application.

VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Evaluation of soil moisture information should consider when key crop development stages occur and, ultimately, when farmers must make decisions based on soil moisture status. Therefore, we assessed the performance of three microwave satellites (SMAP, SMOS, and METOP/ASCAT) and three reanalysis models (MERRA-2, NARR, and WEPP) in the U.S. Corn Belt in the context of agricultural management. Thermal time and crop progress reports from the USDA-NASS defined critical transition periods of crop growth and management decisions for the validation process. Contrary to calendar timelines like annual segments, these key events separate the year into five irregular segments. Measurements at the South Fork Core Validation Site from 2016 to 2020 show that the two passive microwave satellites are dry compared to in-situ observations, but the active satellite and reanalysis model products were almost always wetter. Overall, most products perform the best during the pre-planting and post-harvest segments when no crops are present and worst during the active management phase when crops are starting to grow.

TI  - Combined active and {Passive} microwave remote sensing of {Soil} {Moisture} for vegetated surfaces at {L}-band
VL  - NA
SN  - NA
AB  - Combined active and passive microwave remote sensing of vegetated surfaces is of great interest and importance given the increasing number of active and passive satellite microwave missions and datasets available for studies in land surfaces for application in hydrology and terrestrial ecology [1]. For many years, passive microwave retrieval algorithms for satellite missions such as AMSR-E, SMOS, and SMAP have been based on the omega (Ï‰)-tau (Ï€)-h model [2, 3], which is derived from the zeroth order solution of radiative transfer equation. Since the zeroth order solution ignores the Phase matrixterm, it is only valid when the omega is small. Using the physical scattering model of branches and leaves, the calculated omega at L-band is in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 and is not small. Thus the small omega used in omega-tau-h model is an effective parameter rather than a physical parameter. In modeling the rough surface effects, the omega-tau-h model only includes the coherent wave specular reflection as represented by h [4] while ignoring the bistaic scattering. Thus the omega-tau-h model uses a small h such as 0.1. The physical h, as calculated by numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations in 3D simulations (NMM3D) [5], is much larger and can be as large as unity at L-band. Thus the omega-tau-h model uses effective small omega and effective small h both of which are much smaller than the physical calculated values. For active remote sensing, we previously used the distorted Born approximation [6] and NMM3D (NMM3D-DBA)where the coherent reflectivity and rough surface scattering are calculated by NMM3D [7]. The model was used to calculate the V V and HH backscatter at L-band for grass [8], wheat and canola fields. The active model has been validated with Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) data [9] and shown good soil moisture retrieval results from the radar data compared with the ground measurements [8]. The distorted Born approximation is valid because the optical thickness at L-band is small. The distorted Born approximation is consistent with the first order radiative transfer theory except it includes backscattering enhancement in the double-bounce term. In this paper, we study the active and passive microwave remote sensing using NMM3D-DBA for both active and passive where NMM3D for rough surface bistatic scattering is used. The active model NMM3D-DBA is extended to calculate bistatic scattering and an integration of the bistatic scattering over the hemispherical solid angle is used to calculate emissivity. Thus the active and passive microwave remote sensing models are founded on the same theoretical basis and use the same physical parameters such as crop density, plant height, stalk orientation, leave radius, surface roughness, and so on. The vegetation canopy is modeled as a layer of uniformly distributed dielectric cylinders and disks representing stalks and leaves, respectively [6]. The distorted Born approximation is derived from Foldy-Lax equation with first-order iteration using the half-space Green's function and T-matrix [10]. The attenuation through the vegetation layer is accounted for by the imaginary part of the effective propagation constant calculated using Foldy's approximation [10]. The total bistatic scattering is expressed as the sum of three scattering mechanisms: volume scattering, double bounce scattering and surface scattering. Data-cubes which are lookup tables with three axes: vegetation water content (VWC), root mean square (RMS) height of an isotropic surface and soil permittivity directly related to the soil moisture [8], are then generated for both active and passive. From the active and passive data-cubes, the Î² parameter describing the linear relation between brightness temperature and co-polarized backscatter [11] is also derived for various rough surface and vegetation conditions. The data-cubes are useful for retrievals of detailed soil and vegetation characteristics such as soil moisture [8]. The model results are validated by coincidental airborne Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) data and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data taken during the SMAPVEX12 field campaign [9]. Time-series retrieval of the soil moisture [8] is also performed by inverting the data-cubes assuming that RMS height does not change over time whose results are then compared with the ground measurements.

AB  - Microwave remote sensing technology has emerged to provide valuable products to monitor and assess soil moisture content at regional or global scales. However, each soil moisture product exhibits different advantages and shortcomings. Data fusion could help improve accuracy by merging information from different sources. In this research, a traditional triple collocation (TC) based method and a novel Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) are used to merge soil moisture products from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) and The Advanced 1SCATterometer (ASCAT) for a study area located in western Europe. This research reveals that the LSTM outperforms the traditional TC based method for data fusion. The study identifies that both climate forcing and physiographic attributes significantly influence the spatial and temporal variations observed in the LSTM merging scheme. Consequently, the study highlights the considerable potential of the LSTM method for large-scale integration of remote sensing soil moisture data

TI  - An {Integrated} {Time}-{Series} {Relative} {Soil} {Moisture} {Monitoring} {Method} {Based} on a {SAR} {Backscattering} {Model
VL  - NA
SN  - 2151-1535
AB  - Time-series monitoring of relative surface soil moisture (RSSM) with remote sensing observation is crucial for guiding agricultural irrigation management and monitoring global climate change. However, existing SAR soil moisture retrieval algorithms suffer from insufficient decoupling of surface scattering characteristics and poor RSSM time-series monitoring capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated time-series relative soil moisture monitoring method based on a SAR backscattering model (SBM). Initially, the SBM is introduced, categorizing land cover into built-up areas, water bodies, vegetation-covered areas, and soil. Addressing the inconsistency in spatiotemporal resolution between optical vegetation indices and SAR data, we establish a unique SAR water cloud model (SWCM) in conjunction with the dual-polarization SAR vegetation index (DRVIs). By employing the SWCM to eliminate vegetation's influence, a high-quality soil backscatter coefficient is obtained. Ultimately, the dry and wet reference values of soil backscatter are calculated to retrieve the relative RSSM time series. Based on Sentinel-1 data, we select three representative experimental areas, namely the Qarhan Salt Lake in dry regions, the Tibetan Plateau Naqu in high-cold regions, and Inner Mongolia Xilinhot in grassland regions, conducting RSSM spatiotemporal monitoring for three years. Experimental results demonstrate that the RSSM exhibits seasonal variations in these three regions. The correlation coefficient between the RSSM monitoring results and the in-situ data exceeds 0.64, with a maximum of 0.84. Consequently, the proposed method underscores the advantages of simplicity in parameters, high estimation precision, and robust adaptability, thereby augmenting the potential for large-scale global monitoring applications.

AB  - Soil moisture is a critical variable in climate forecasting, hydrology, and others. Satellite-based remote sensing techniques have been used to map soil moisture globally, including visual bands, infrared, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), passive microwave remote sensing, etc. Passive microwave remote sensing techniques, especially at the L-band, such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), have higher accuracy than the others due to their higher sensitivity to the dielectric constant of the soil profile. However, the unclear sensing depth at L-band for SMOS and SMAP leads to a mismatch in the calibration/validation and application of their soil moisture products. In this study, we apply soil temperature sensing depth model, i.e., the tau-z model, to the soil temperature, soil moisture, and brightness temperature (TB) data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR). The effectiveness of the tau-z model in interpreting the L-band microwave observations is validated through forward simulations with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling (CMEM). Results showed that: 1) the bias in TB simulation can be reduced from 26.22â€‰K/12.00â€‰K to -11.66â€‰K/-8.839â€‰K for H/V-polarization; 2) the RMSE is reduced from 30.2â€‰K/20.48â€‰K to 12.92â€‰K/11.66â€‰K for H/V-polarization by considering the microwave sensing depth. Daily TB signal variation partly attributed to the soil temperature sensing depth due to different bands' penetration capacity. The result is expected to improve the understanding of microwave data collected by muli-frequency synthetic platforms such as Copernicus Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CIMR).

SN  - 2771-9529
AB  - Soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements are vital for improving water usage efficiency and monitoring soil salinization. Water stress and groundwater salinity are the twin problems associated with excessive groundwater extraction and irrigation with saline water. Small and marginal farmers are the majority in India and require low-cost sensors for measuring soil moisture and EC. This work evaluates the performance of a low-cost capacitance-resistive sensor for soil moisture and EC measurement in different soil types. The results show that bulk EC and bulk density of the soils moderately affect the sensor output (oscillation frequency) for moisture measurement. The multilinear regression models developed using experimental data for moisture have an R2 of 0.93, which is at par with the commercial sensors reviewed by researchers. Bulk EC variation with moisture showed significant variation with soil type due to differences in the salinity levels of soil samples. Therefore, the field devices require standard EC thresholds for salinity similar to laboratory standards.

AB  - Accurate soil volumetric water content (VWC) measurement is pivotal for precision agriculture. Soil moisture sensor technology is crucial in this context, providing essential VWC data for evaluating information obtained through remote sensing and data assimilation. As the world continuously advances precision agriculture, enhancing the accuracy of VWC measurement becomes paramount. In this study, the researchers investigated the suitable soil moisture sensor for optimal agricultural application on clay soil. Five different kinds of soil moisture sensors classified into three resistance-based and two capacitance-based were analyzed. The parameters assessed in the study were precision, linearity, and accuracy. These variables are measured using the raw readings of each sensor; precision was determined using deviation value, linearity was identified using the linearity regression graph, and accuracy was obtained by comparing the expected and actual values of VWC. Each sensor parameter was compared to determine which stands out among the five soil moisture sensors. From the collected data, STEMMA was the most suitable soil moisture sensor for clay applications among the five, with a linearity coefficient of 0.9767, deviation values below 2 (high precision), and an average accuracy of 90.8 percent across five VWC levels.

AB  - Signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry (SoOp-R) is a maturing field for geophysical remote sensing as evidenced by the growing number of airborne and  spaceborne experiments. As this approach receives more attention, it is worth  analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve subsurface soil moisture (SM) by  leveraging communication and navigation satellite transmitters. In this research,  the CRLB is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on the  best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study  investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and incidence angle  measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric profile. The results also  detail the effects of variable SM conditions on the capability of SoOp-R systems  to predict subsurface SM. The most prevalent observation is the importance of  using at least two frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM  estimates. If at least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is  retrievable within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as  the number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30 cm, it  is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy is  achievable with as few as 2 dual-frequency-based SoOp-R measurements. For this  depth, increasing number of measurements provided by polarization and incidence  angle allow for sensing of increasingly wet SM profile structures. This study,  overall, details a methodology by which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to  achieve a desired CRLB using a trade-off study between the available measurements  and SM profile.

VL  - 32
SN  - 1001-9332
AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of four phosphorus treatments on crop yields, and analyzed crop phosphorus uptake and phosphorus utilization  efficiency, as well as changes in soil phosphorus deficit in maize-wheat rotation  system, based on a 7-year field experiment in Baoding City, Hebei Province. The  results showed that long-term phosphorus application significantly increased the  yield and phosphorus uptake of maize and wheat. The yield and phosphorus uptake  of maize and wheat showed a parabolic trend that first increased and then  decreased with the increases of phosphorus application. The utilization  efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer in the corn season was higher than that in  the wheat season under various phosphorus application treatments. The cumulative  utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer in the wheat season showed a  downward trend. The decline rate showed that optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater}  70\% optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater}130\% optimized phosphorus application. The  cumulative utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertili-zer in the corn season  showed an upward trend. For the rising rate, the optimized phosphorus application  {\textgreater} 70\% optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater} 130\% optimized phosphorus application.  Both the apparent phosphorus surplus and the accumulated phosphorus surplus of  the soil without phosphorus application were under phosphorus deficiency. Under  the treatment of phosphorus application, soil phosphorus showed a status of  phosphorus surplus. The higher the phosphorus application rate, the longer the  accumulation period, the higher the soil phosphorus surplus. Under the straw  returning condition, phosphorus application rate for wheat of 105-150 kgÂ·hm(-2)  and the phosphorus application rate for maize of 63-90 kgÂ·hm(-2) in Hebei  fluvo-aquic soil could ensure the high crop yield, keep the phosphorus  utilization efficiency at a high level, and reduce soil phosphorus accumulation  and environmental risks.

VL  - 34
SN  - 1001-9332
AB  - Soil moisture factor is one of the important parameters in the study of wind and sand fixation functions of ecosystems. Traditional methods often use potential  evaporation, rainfall, and irrigation observed by meteorological stations to  estimate soil moisture, which has significant limitations in terms of spatial  continuity and data availability. Based on the development of remote sensing  technology in soil moisture detection, we selected four remote sen-sing  indicators for soil moisture (MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method, SMAP soil  moisture ratio method, visible shortwave infrared drought index method, and  remote sensing humidity index method) to improve the estimation of soil moisture  factor in the modified wind erosion equation model (RWEQ), and used the improved  algorithm to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of wind  prevention and sand fixation services in the northwest region of Liaoning  Province from 2001 to 2021. The results showed that the MODIS evapotranspiration  ratio method had the highest correlation with traditional meteorological methods  in calculating soil moisture. The formula obtained by fitting the two could be  used to improve the calculation of soil moisture factor in the RWEQ model. From  2001 to 2021, the wind prevention and sand fixation capacity in the northwest  region of Liaoning Province showed strong spatial distribution characteristics in  the northern and eastern regions, while weak in the central and western regions.  According to Mann-Kendall trend testing, 72.7\% of the regions in northwest  Liaoning Province were showing an upward trend in their ability to prevent wind  and fix sand. The application of geographic detector models for driving factor  analysis showed that the change in wind and sand fixation capacity was a process  of multiple factors interacting with each other, greatly influenced by soil type,  annual wind speed, and economic development level. Moreover, the interaction  between various driving factors had a higher impact on wind and sand fixation  than that of single factors. The results could improve the RWEQ model estimation  and provide technical support for the long-term analysis of ecological function  formation mechanisms and driving forces in the northwest region of Liaoning.

SN  - 1001-9332
AB  - Energy saving, emission reduction, and efficiency improvement are important directions for agricultural development in Central Henan Province, the main grain  production area in the Huang-huai-hai Plain. Based on the tillage and  fertilization positioning experiment in 2010, we investigated the effects of  three tillage methods (deep tillage, shallow tillage, and no-tillage) and two  fertilization methods (nitrogen fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer+organic  fertilizer) on soil nitrogen balance and greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 to  2019. The results showed that soil nitrogen accumulation increased with organic  fertilizer addition. During wheat and maize maturation, soil total nitrogen  accumulation in the 0-60 cm layer was the highest under the treatment of shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer, being 8058.53 and 8299 kg NÂ·hm(-2), respectively,  being 3.2\%-27.4\% and 4.3\%-7.2\% higher than other treatments. The treatment with  organic fertilizer addition resulted in nitrogen surplus. The shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer treatment led to the highest nitrogen surplus (13.57  kg NÂ·hm(-2)), which was 9.52 and 0.18 kg NÂ·hm(-2) higher than deep  tillage+organic fertilizer and no tillage+organic fertilizer treatments. Nitrate  leaching was the main way of nitrogen losses, accounting for 73.4\%-76.9\% of the  total losses. The amount of nitrate leaching was the highest in deep  tillage+organic fertilizer treatment (48.37 kg NÂ·hm(-2)), being 18.9\%-35.1\%  higher than other treatments. Results of greenhouse gases emission during  2018-2019 showed that global warming potential was the highest under the  treatment of deep tillage+organic fertilizer, which was 33070 kg NÂ·hm(-2), being  6.6\%-26.8\% higher than other treatments. The treatment of organic fertilizer  addition increased the emission of N(2)O and CO(2) and reduced the absorption of  CH(4). The annual grain yield was highest under the treatment of deep  tillage+organic fertilizer, which was 5.0\%-17.1\% higher than other treatments.  The crop harvest index was the highest under the treatment of shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer. The recommended cropping mode in Central Henan  Pro-vince is shallow tillage+organic fertilizer, which could ensure crop yields,  maintain soil nitrogen balance, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - In the winter-wheat and summer-maize multiple cropping system in lime concretion black soil of Huanghuaihai Plain, the effects of three tilling methods  (conventional tillage, rotary tillage, subsoiling tillage) in wheat season  coupling with three nitrogen treatments (120 kgÂ·hm(-2), 225 kgÂ·hm(-2), 330  kgÂ·hm(-2)) before maize sowing on the activities of microorganisms and enzymes  re-lated nitrogen transformation, and inorganic nitrogen content in the  rhizosphere soil during the main growth stages of maize, as well as the yield  were investigated. The results showed that the rotary tillage had the highest  ammonification intensity, and the more nitrogen was put in, the higher were the  activities of microorganisms and enzymes related to soil nitrogen transformation.  The activities of nitrification, denitrification and urease of subsoiling tillage  was significantly higher than those of conventional and rotary tillage.  Furthermore, in subsoiling tillage treatment, increasing nitrogen fertili-zer  could promote soil nitrogen transformation while excessive nitrogen input  inhibited soil nitrogen transformation, though the latter had higher yield and  soil inorganic nitrogen content. The treatment of subsoiling tillage coupling  with 225 kgÂ·hm(-2) nitrogen, was best for soil nitrogen transformation while the  treatment of subsoiling tillage coupling with 330 kgÂ·hm(-2) nitrogen, had the  highest corn yield.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas Satellites, particularly at L-band frequency, can globally map near-surface soil moisture. Near-surface moisture is extended to the root zone using models and data assimilation. Validation uses core monitoring sites, monitoring networks, field campaigns, and multi-satellite comparisons. Efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes. This is an update to the special section â€œRemote Sensing for Vadose Zone Hydrologyâ€”A Synthesis from the Vantage Pointâ€ [Vadose Zone Journal 12(3)]. Satellites (e.g., Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP] and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [SMOS]) using passive microwave techniques, in particular at L-band frequency, have shown good promise for global mapping of near-surface (0â€“5-cm) soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 25 to 40 km and temporal resolution of 2 to 3 d. C- and X-band soil moisture records date back to 1978, making available an invaluable data set for long-term climate research. Near-surface soil moisture is further extended to the root zone (top 1 m) using process-based models and data assimilation schemes. Validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products has been ongoing using core monitoring sites, sparse monitoring networks, intensive field campaigns, as well as multi-satellite comparison studies. To transfer empirical observations across space and time scales and to develop improved retrieval algorithms at various resolutions, several efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes in various energy- and water-rich environments. We describe the most recent scientific and technological advances in soil moisture remote sensing. We anticipate that remotely sensed soil moisture will find many applications in vadose zone hydrology in the coming decades.

TI  - Analysis of metamaterial-inspired soil moisture microwave sensor
VL  - 64
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract In this letter, the authors propose a microwave sensor capable to detect soil moisture content parameter for use in precision agriculture and agricultural smart monitoring applications. The novel sensor is based on complementary split-ring resonator metamaterial topology, microstrip line and was built under biodegradable dielectric substrate of polylactic acid for sustainable purposes. The sensing mechanism relates the sensor's resonant frequency to the soil moisture content changes over time. For experimental validation purposes, a compact sensor prototype (75 mm Ã— 35 mm Ã— 1.55 mm and 12 g) with fundamental resonant frequency at 958 MHz was built and submitted to calibration process on typically sandy and clay soils to get fitting models capable to estimate soil moisture content. Simulated and experimental results are presented together and show good agreement with each other. The calibration data for both soil types were processed using the least-squares method and the proposed curve-fitting models are capable to estimate soil moisture content levels from 5\% to 20\% for sandy soil and from 12\% to 23\% for clay soil with satisfactory accuracy, proving the device viability.

TI  - Uniplanar multirod {TDR} probe for soil water content measurement over a larger spatial scale
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract This study developed a uniplanar multirod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and evaluated it in laboratory experiments for soil water measurement over a larger spatial scale. The sampling volume of the probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes. Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5â€“6 cm on both sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data.

TI  - Detection and analysis of soil water content based on experimental reflectance spectrum data
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract In order to improve the yield of crops, the method of soil water content detection and analysis based on experimental reflectance spectrum data is adopted. From the four aspects of the farmland soil water detection based on reflection spectrum information, soil water content detection in farmland based on spectral absorption characteristics, remote sensing inversion of soil water content of farmland by reflectance spectra data, and soil water content detection in farmland based on near-infrared spectroscopy, the soil water content of farmland can be analyzed. The absorption valley near 1,920 nm is the characteristic absorption valley of soil water in the black soil, which can be used to predict the water content of the black soil by the spectral characteristic parameters of the absorption valley; soil water will increase the absorption of radiation energy and reduce the overall reflectance spectra of soil. The quantitative monitoring of soil water content can be achieved by using the remote sensing model of soil water content in this paper. In the range of low soil water content, the reflectance decreases with the increase of soil water content in farmland, whereas in the range of high soil water content, it increases with the increase of soil water content in farmland. The correlation between soil water content and normalized spectral reflectance is positive and negative correlation and mainly negative correlation. The method can detect soil water content in farmland under extreme conditions of different texture, soil water, salinity, and organic matter. It is an effective method for soil water content detection.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a standard method to estimate soil water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. In many applications, several TDR probes are installed in soil columns or field setups, and TDR measurements are acquired using a multiplexing system. Commercially available multiplexers share a common ground, which might lead to inaccurate TDR measurements when probes are installed close together or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a new eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed that allows communication with standard TDR equipment. In a first step, the new multiplexer was tested to analyze channel noise and channel to channel variability for open reflection coefficients and travel times. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the channels for both the open reflection coefficient and travel times. Second, the 50C81-SDM multiplexer was tested using TDR probes installed in electrolyte solutions and a sand tank. In contrast to multiplexers with a common ground, they showed no interference of closely spaced TDR probes (spacing ranging from 5 to 95 cm). On the other hand, the SDMX50 multiplexer showed absolute differences in bulk electrical conductivities of {\textgreater}0.001 Smâˆ’1 for high volumetric water contents and high bulk electrical conductivities. Measurements at a test site with high electromagnetic noise showed the applicability of the 50C81-SDM multiplexer in such environments, but only if the entire TDR setup was disconnected from the permanent power supply.

VL  - 50

AB  - Characterizing both spatial and temporal soil moisture (Î¸) dynamics at site scales is difficult with existing technologies. To address this shortcoming, we developed a distributed soil moisture sensing system that employs a distributed temperature sensing system to monitor thermal response at 2 m intervals along the length of a buried cable which is subjected to heat pulses. The cable temperature response to heating, which is strongly dependent on soil moisture, was empirically related to colocated, dielectric-based Î¸ measurements at three locations. Spatially distributed, and temporally continuous estimates of Î¸ were obtained in dry conditions (Î¸â‰¤ 0.31) using this technology (root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.016), but insensitivity of the instrument response curve adversely affected accuracy under wet conditions (RMSE = 0.050).

VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Ring-capacitor sensors are used widely for real-time estimation of volumetric soil water content Î¸ from measured resonant frequency fr, which is directly affected by the bulk soil permittivity Îµ. However, the relationship fr(Îµ) requires improved quantification. We conducted laboratory experiments to characterize the response of the Sentek EnviroSMART sensor system for a full range of Îµ values from air to water and a range of temperatures. Waterâ€“dioxane mixtures were placed into a solvent-resistant container equipped with custom tools for heating and mixing the fluid, removing air bubbles from sensitive surfaces, measuring permittivity in situ, and creating an axisymmetric metal disturbance to the electric field. Total capacitance C was measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to one sensor, while four other sensors provided replicated fr readings. The measured temperature response of free water permittivity was linear with a negative slope, which is qualitatively consistent with theory. A precise nonlinear relationship between Îµ and normalized fr was derived. The instrumental error in Îµ was RMSEÎµ = 0.226 (for 3 {\textless} Îµ {\textless} 43), which corresponds to a measurement precision in Î¸(Îµ) derived from Topp's equation of RMSEÎ¸= 0.0034 m3mâˆ’3 Axisymmetric numerical simulations of the electric field supplemented the experimental results. The characteristic length scale for the distance measured radially from the access tube is 12.5 mm, meaning that 80 and 95\% of the signal are sensed within approximately 20 and 37 mm of the access tube, respectively. The results are crucial for scientific applications of the investigated sensor type to environmental media.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Wireless sensor networks are becoming more popular to monitor spatial and temporal variability of soil water content. The aim of this paper is to calibrate and test the newly developed SPADE sensor for wireless sensor network applications. During calibration, the measured sensor output is related to dielectric permittivity using an empirical calibration in liquids with well-defined permittivities. Using these calibration measurements, we have evaluated sensor-to-sensor variability and compared the accuracy of a universal calibration between sensor output and permittivity with a sensor-specific calibration. Our results showed that the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE sensor is larger than sensor noise and that a sensor-specific calibration can improve the accuracy of soil water content estimation as compared to a single universal calibration. To quantify the effect of temperature on the sensor output, we have derived a temperature correction function in a temperature range from 5 to 40Â°C. The results showed an underestimation for low temperatures (5 to 25Â°C) and an overestimation for high temperatures (25 to 40Â°C). A second-order polynomial function was fitted to the measurements with good agreement (R2 = 0.9831, RMSE = 0.1489). The transferability of the temperature correction function from reference liquids to soils was verified using saturated coarse sand and a silty loam soil sample. The temperature-corrected SPADE sensor measurements in soil showed good agreement with TDR measurements and corresponded well with theoretical predictions from a dielectric mixing model.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC) and biomass production is important for sustainable resources management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron ratio (Nr) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear relationship between Nr and the aboveground biomass that allowed to continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22 kg/m2. This information was used together with measured belowground biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error from 0.046 to 0.013 cm3/cm3. We anticipate that future research on the Nr can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception, ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary and roving CRNS systems.

AB  - Abstract Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of significant importance for numerous Earth and environmental science applications that directly impact the global environment and human society. Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable environmental development, and food security.

TI  - Feasibility of soil moisture monitoring with heated fiber optics
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Accurate methods are needed to measure changing soil water content from meter to kilometer scales. Laboratory results demonstrate the feasibility of the heat pulse method implemented with fiber optic temperature sensing to obtain accurate distributed measurements of soil water content. A fiber optic cable with an electrically conductive armoring was buried in variably saturated sand and heated via electrical resistance to create thermal pulses monitored by observing the distributed Raman backscatter. A new and simple interpretation of heat data that takes advantage of the characteristics of fiber optic temperature measurements is presented. The accuracy of the soil water content measurements varied approximately linearly with water content. At volumetric moisture content of 0.05 m3/m3 the standard deviation of the readings was 0.001 m3/m3, and at 0.41 m3/m3 volumetric moisture content the standard deviation was 0.046 m3/m3. This uncertainty could be further reduced by averaging several heat pulse interrogations and through use of a higher-performance fiber optic sensing system.

AB  - Core Ideas 4-yr monitoring of soil water content dynamics for different plant types. Horizontal crosshole GPR at the field-plot scale sampled âˆ¼65 m3. Natural, irrigated, and sheltered treatments in gravelly and clayeyâ€“silty soils. Consistent patches of soil water content were observed along horizontal slices using GPR. Results enable improved investigation of soilâ€“plantâ€“atmosphere interactions. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has shown a high potential to derive soil water content (SWC) at different scales. In this study, we combined multiple horizontal GPR measurements at different depths to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the SWC under cropped plots. The SWC data were analyzed for four growing seasons between 2014 and 2017, two soil types (gravelly and clayeyâ€“silty), two crops (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and maize [Zea mays L.]), and three different water treatments. We acquired more than 150 time-lapse GPR datasets along 6-m-long horizontal crossholes at six depths. The GPR SWC distributions are distinct both horizontally and vertically for both soil types. A clear change in SWC can be observed at both sites between the surface layer ({\textgreater}0.3 m) and subsoil. Alternating patches of higher and lower SWC, probably caused by the soil heterogeneity, were observed along the horizontal SWC profiles. To investigate the changes in SWC with time, GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data were averaged for each depth and compared with changes in precipitation, treatment, and soil type. The high-temporal-resolution TDR and the large-sampling-volume GPR show similar trends in SWC for both sites, but because of the different sensing volumes, different responses were obtained due to the spatial heterogeneity. A difference in spatial variation of the crosshole GPR SWC data was detected between maize and wheat. The results for this 4-yr period indicate the potential of this novel experimental setup to monitor spatial and temporal SWC changes that can be used to study soilâ€“plantâ€“atmosphere interactions.

TI  - Feasibility of soil moisture estimation using passive distributed temperature sensing
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Through its role in the energy and water balances at the land surface, soil moisture is a key state variable in surface hydrology and land-atmosphere interactions. Point observations of soil moisture are easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS. Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1 m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables was known with greater certainty.

TI  - Derived functions of time domain reflectometry for soil moisture measurement
VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - This paper gives a systematic framework for evaluating the time domain reflectometry (TDR) response of soil. TDR measures the soil composite dielectric constant (Ka); thus any factor that has an influence on Ka measurement can affect soil moisture determination. On the basis of known dielectric constants of air, soil, water, and ice, as well as the volumetric fraction of each phase in a bulk soil, functional relationships between volumetric water content (Î¸Ï…, cm3/cmâˆ’3) and Ka are derived in the form of Î¸v=aKa0.5+b. In general, the TDR functions derived from this study are in good agreement with the â€œuniversal equationâ€ developed through experiments by Topp et al. [1980] and other available TDR calibration data. This paper demonstrates that (1) soil solid and porosity have little effect on dielectric constant measurement; (2) temperature has a minor influence except for very wet soils; and (3) surface area is an important factor affecting the water content measurement.

VL  - 56
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Preventive control of desert locusts is based on monitoring recession areas to detect outbreaks. Remote sensing has been increasingly used in the preventive control strategy. Soil moisture is a major ecological driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current imagery toolkit for preventive management. By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution from a disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to help preventive management of desert locust. We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above 0.09 cm3/cm3 for 20 days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may increase the chance to observe locusts 70 days later. We estimate the gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation to be 3 weeks. We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence. Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution should be used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest management.

VL  - 77
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential climate variable influencing landâ€“atmosphere interactions, an essential hydrologic variable impacting rainfallâ€“runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable constraining food security. Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to spatial variability and model structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.

VL  - 31

AB  - Abstract In the present investigation, we report a voltammetric sensor based on Nafion modified screen printed carbon ink functionalized with 4-aminobenzo-18-crown-6 ether for the detection of soil potassium. The potassium is one of the major nutrient elements required by the plants and is critical for the crop productivity. The selective and sensitive assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of 4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown ether derivative and proposed simplicity of fabrication protocol makes the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil analysis.

VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas Topographic variation influenced soil nutrient distribution in a silvopasture system. High-resolution digital maps of soil nutrients were generated. Terrain attributes identified topographic functional units as management zones. Level of soil nutrients in topographic functional units were different. Topography plays a crucial role in spatial distribution of nutrients in soils; however, studies to quantify topographic influence on soil nutrient distribution from a silvopasture system are mostly lacking. To address this question, a 4.3-ha silvopasture site in northwest Arkansas was selected and a total of 51 topsoil (0â€“15 cm thickness) samples were collected and analyzed for primary (total N [TN], P, K), secondary (Ca, Mg, S), and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, B, Na). Topographic information was acquired from 12 terrain attributes derived from a 1-m digital elevation model. The prediction model was based on random forest. Results showed TN, S, and P were best predicted, whereas Cu, Ca, and Mn had the lowest prediction performance. Levels of S, Ca, Zn, Fe, and TN increased with SAGA wetness index, valley depth, flow accumulation, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index. Normalized height and slope height were positively related to Na but negatively to B and Cu distribution. Aspect had a positive influence on P and Mg concentrations. Based on terrain attributes, the study site could be divided into four topographic functional units (TFU), namely A, B, C, and D; TFU A had the highest nutrients present, whereas TFU B had the lowest P, K, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ca but highest Na content. However, Mn, Mg, and B did not vary among TFUs. This study affirmed topographic influences on soil nutrient distribution, and the resulting continuous soil nutrient maps are useful for fine-tuning production systems through optimum nutrient and pasture management.

TI  - Developing a strategy for the national coordinated soil moisture monitoring network
VL  - 20
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil moisture is a critical land surface variable, affecting a wide variety of climatological, agricultural, and hydrological processes. Determining the current soil moisture status is possible via a variety of methods, including in situ monitoring, remote sensing, and numerical modeling. Although all of these approaches are rapidly evolving, there is no cohesive strategy or framework to integrate these diverse information sources to develop and disseminate coordinated national soil moisture products that will improve our ability to understand climate variability. The National Coordinated Soil Moisture Monitoring Network initiative has developed a national strategy for network coordination with NOAA's National Integrated Drought Information System. The strategy is currently in review within NOAA, and work is underway to implement the initial milestones of the strategy. This update reviews the goals and steps being taken to establish this national-scale coordination for soil moisture monitoring in the United States.

VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas Evaporative drying of soil columns was monitored in high resolution using NMR. Soil moisture data were used for validating a water, vapor, and heat flow model. The Richards approach was insufficient under Stage II conditions. NMR is a feasible technique for soil moisture measurements under Stage II conditions. Evaporation from bare soil surfaces can be restrained to a great extent with the development of a dry layer at the soil surface where capillary hydraulic conductance ceases and water flow proceeds only by gas phase transport. Model calculations and preliminary experiments with model porous media have shown that this surface layer can be very thin. An accurate characterization of these processes is required, which is provided by noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) methods. The evaporative drying of a silt loam and a sandy loam was monitored at high spatial resolution in laboratory experiments. The MR data were used to assess the performance of two numerical models: (i) the Richards equation, which considers isothermal liquid water flow, and (ii) a coupled soil water, heat, and vapor flow numerical model. The experimental results reveal two distinct drying regimes for both soil types where, at the onset of the second evaporation stage, a dry surface zone developed with increasing thickness over time. This layer revealed that water loss inside the soil coincided with a relatively low evaporation rate as the liquid continuity to the soil surface vanished. The modeling results clearly demonstrated the need to consider heat and vapor flow. It was shown, as a proof of principle, that MR relaxation time spectra may serve as a proxy to follow desaturation processes where spatially resolved transverse relaxation can reveal a secondary evaporation front.

VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas A TDR array has been developed for soil moisture profiling. The sensor provides eight incremental measurements at centimeter-depth resolution. Permittivity, evaporation rate, and soil moisture profile were determined. Near-surface soil conditions (i.e., moisture and temperature) moderate mass and energy exchange at the soilâ€“atmosphere interface. While remote sensing offers an effective means for mapping near-surface moisture content across large areas, in situ measurements, targeting those specific remotely sensed soil depths, are poorly understood and high-resolution near-surface measurement capabilities are lacking. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established, accurate measurement method for soil dielectric permittivity and moisture content. A TDR array was designed to provide centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface soil moisture. The array consists of nine stainless steel TDR rods spaced 1 cm apart, acting as waveguide pairs to form eight two-rod TDR probes in series. A critical aspect of the design was matching the spacing of the coaxial cableâ€“TDR rod transition to avoid unwanted reflections in the waveforms. The accuracy of the TDR array permittivity measurement (Â±1 permittivity unit) was similar to that of conventional TDR as verified in dielectric liquids. Electric field numerical simulations showed minimal influence of adjacent rods during a given rod-pair measurement. The evaporation rate determined by the TDR array compared well with mass balance data in a laboratory test. Near-surface soil moisture profile dynamics were monitored at centimeter-depth resolution using the TDR array in a field experiment where volumetric moisture content estimates (0â€“8 cm) were within 2\% of conventional three-rod TDR probes averaging across 0 to 8 cm and from 1- to 3-cm depths.

VL  - 59
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an âˆ¼9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (â‰¤10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.

TI  - Measurement of soil moisture content under physical crust by millimetre-wave backscattering
VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - Summary This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method, therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0â€“3 cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the depth of the entire upper root zone (0â€“30 cm) and of the plough layer (0â€“20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further development and use of the method described herein will make it simple and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the soilâ€“water interface. The major processes for which this information is important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and evaporation) and soil erosion.

AB  - Abstract Soil moisture stress and salinity are considered as a major form of land degradation in rain-fed agricultural regions. The study has been carried out for four distinct periods such as 2001, 2005, 2010, and 2015 that was selected according to the climatic variations that occurred more than a decade. The multispectral remote sensing-based empirical models were employed on Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager imageries to estimate the rate of soil moisture stress and salinity from 2001â€“2015. The rate of soil moisture stress has been magnified to 143\%, and salinity was increased by 70\% particularly from 2005â€“2010 when the drought period occurred. The reliability of identifying the saline-affected soils from the multispectral remote sensing models was significantly affected (R2 = 0.39) because of the extensive distribution of Nerium oleander plants and water logging state in the study region. The modified microwave water cloud model revealed the three-layer information such as N. oleander, soil, and vegetation such that an imaginary part of the dielectric constant derived from simplified Hallikainen empirical model has got good correlation (R2 = 0.73) with ground electrical conductivity measurements.

VL  - 5
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important hydrologic state variable critical to successful hydroclimatic and environmental predictions. Soil moisture varies both in space and time because of spatio-temporal variations in precipitation, soil properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics. In recent years, air- and space-borne remote sensing campaigns have successfully demonstrated the use of passive microwave remote sensing to map soil moisture status near the soil surface (â‰ˆ0â€“0.05 m below the ground) at various spatial scales. In this study root zone (e.g., â‰ˆ0â€“0.6 m below the ground) soil moisture distributions were estimated across the Little Washita watershed (Oklahoma) by assimilating near-surface soil moisture data from remote sensing measurements using the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique coupled with a numerical one-dimensional vadose zone flow model (HYDRUS-ET). The resulting distributed root zone soil moisture assessment tool (SMAT) is based on the concept of having parallel noninteracting streamtubes (hydrologic units) within a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The simulated soil moisture distribution at various depths and locations within the watershed were compared with measured profile soil moisture data using time domain reflectometry (TDR). A reasonable agreement was found under favorable conditions between footprint-scale model estimations and point-scale field soil moisture measurements in the root zone. However, uncertainties introduced by precipitation and soil hydraulic properties caused suboptimal performance of the integrated model. The SMAT holds great promise and offers flexibility to incorporate various data assimilation techniques, scaling, and other hydrological complexities across large landscapes. The integrated model can be useful for simulating profile soil moisture estimation and for predicting transient soil moisture behavior for a range of hydrological and environmental applications.

VL  - 84
SN  - NA
AB  - From Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo to increasing corn yields in Kansas to greenhouse gas flux in the Arctic, the importance of soil moisture is endemic to world affairs and merits the considerable attention it receives from the scientific community. This importance can hardly be overstated, though it often goes unstated. Soil moisture is one of the key variables in a variety of broad areas critical to the conduct of societies' economic and political affairs and their well-being; these include the health of agricultural crops, global climate dynamics, military trafficability planning, and hazards such as flooding and forest fires. Unfortunately the in situ measurement of the spatial distribution of soil moisture on a watershed-scale is practically impossible. And despite decades of international effort, a satellite remote sensing technique that can reliably measure soil moisture with a spatial resolution of meters has not yet been identified or implemented. Due to the lack of suitable measurement techniques and, until recently digital elevation models (DEMs), our ability to understand and predict soil moisture dynamics through modeling has largely remained crippled from birth [Grayson and Bloschl, 200l].

VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Using optical remote sensing data to downscale microwave soil moisture is currently a crucial technique for producing fine-resolution soil moisture data set at large scales. Conventional soil moisture downscaling models are mainly developed and evaluated in arid or semi-arid regions, but have serious limitation in humid regions. To improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes, this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol under wet climate. Finally, soil moisture downscaling is conducted by applying such models (built at the 25-km scale) at a finer (1-km) resolution. Validation result of downscaled soil moisture against in situ data set demonstrates the advantage of the enhanced model.

AB  - Soil water content is a critical environmental parameter in research and practice, though various technological and contextual constraints limit its estimation in arid areas with vegetation cover. This study combined the multitemporal remote sensing data of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 to conduct an inversion study on surface soil water content under low vegetation cover in Nagqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Four vegetation indices (NDVI, ARVI, EVI, and RVI) were extracted from optical remote sensing data. A water cloud model was used to eliminate the influence of the vegetation layer on the backscattering coefficient associated with vegetation cover, and a predictive model suitable for the Nagqu area was constructed. The water cloud model effectively incorporated a vegetation index instead of vegetation water content. We found that VV polarization was more suitable for soil water content inversion than VH polarization. Among the four vegetation indices, the soil water content inversion model constructed with RVI under VV polarization had the best fit (R2 = 0.8212; RMSE = 6.30). The second-best fit was observed for vegetation water content-NDVI (R2 = 0.8201). The soil water content inversion models all had an R2 {\textgreater} 0.6, regardless of the vegetation index used, though the RVI had the best fitting effect, indicating that this vegetation index is highly applicable in the water cloud model, as a substitute for vegetation water content, and is expected to perform well in similar study sites.

VL  - 2012
SN  - NA
AB  - The productivity of the smallholder farming system in Ghana is under threat due to soil fertility decline. Mineral fertilizer is sparingly being used by smallholder farmers because of prohibitive cost. Grain legumes such as pigeonpea can play a complementary or alternative role as a source of organic fertilizer due to its ability to enhance soil fertility. Despite its importance, the potential of pigeonpea as a soil fertility improvement crop has not been exploited to any appreciable extent and the amount of land cultivated to pigeonpea in Ghana is vey negligible. This paper synthesizes recent studies that have been carried out on pigeonpea in Ghana and discusses the role of pigeonpea cultivation in soil fertility management and its implication for farming system sustainability. The paper shows that recent field studies conducted in both the semi-deciduous forest and the forest/savanna transitional agro-ecological zones of Ghana indicate that pigeonpea/maize rotations can increase maize yield by 75â€“200\%. Barrier to widespread adoption of pigeonpea include land tenure, market, and accessibility to early maturing and high yielding varieties. The paper concludes among other things that in order to promote the cultivation of pigeonpea in Ghana, there is the need to introduce varieties that combine early maturity with high yields and other desirable traits based on farmers preferences.

VL  - 82

AB  - Core Ideas Depth to claypan, landscape position, and cropping system influence soil fertility and nutrient buffering. Accounting for landscape-variable depth to claypan could improve P and K management. Cover crops can help increase soil organic matter content. Cover crops may help reduce P requirements on claypan soils. Precise nutrient management across claypan soil landscapes requires an understanding of how diversity in management practices impacts soil properties and nutrient buffering. Therefore, a study was performed at the Central Mississippi River Basin site of the USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Network from 2010 to 2016 to determine how depth to claypan (DTC), cropping system (CS), and landscape position (LP) affect soil properties, and whether accounting for these factors could improve fertility management. Treatments consisted of five CS MTCS, mulch till corn (Zea mays L.)â€“soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]; NTCS, no-till cornâ€“soybean; NTCSW, no-till cornâ€“soybeanâ€“wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)â€“cover crop; CCRP, cool season conservation reserve program; and HAY, cool and warm-season hay and three LP (summit, backslope, and footslope), each with a distinct DTC. Soil test P (STP) was 9 kg P haâ€“1 greater on footslopes than summits. Soil test K (STK) and soil organic matter content (SOM) were greatest on backslopes and averaged 384 kg K haâ€“1 and 20 g kgâ€“1, respectively, Soil test P was â‰¥49\% and STK was â‰¥10\% lower in NTCSW than in MTCS or NTCS. However, crop diversity in NTCSW maintained STP and increased SOM 2 g kgâ€“1 over MTCS. Soil test P, pHs, and SOM were similar between CCRP and HAY, while STK in CCRP was greater at all LP. Lastly, deeper DTC caused greater P buffering and less K buffering than shallower DTC. These results indicate that eroded sideslopes with shallow DTC likely need more or more frequent P and less K than other LP.

TI  - Remote sensing-based retrieval of soil moisture content using stacking ensemble learning models
VL  - 34
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methodsâ€”classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.

TI  - Calibration of soil moisture sensing with subsurface heated fiber optics using numerical simulation
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract The heat pulse probe method can be implemented with actively heated fiber optics (AHFO) to obtain distributed measurements of soil water content (Î¸) by using reported soil thermal responses measured by Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and with a soil-specific calibration relationship. However, most reported applications have been calibrated to homogeneous soils in a laboratory, while inexpensive efficient in situ calibration procedures useful in heterogeneous soils are lacking. Here we employed the Hydrus 2-D/3-D code to define a soil-specific calibration curve. We define a 2-D geometry of the fiber optic cable and the surrounding soil media, and simulate heat pulses to capture the soil thermal response at different soil water contents. The model was validated in an irrigated field using DTS data from two locations along the FO deployment in which reference moisture sensors were installed. Results indicate that Î¸ was measured with the model-based calibration with accuracy better than 0.022 m3 mâˆ’3.

TI  - Land-surface controls on near-surface soil moisture dynamics: {Traversing} remote sensing footprints
VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract In this new era of remote-sensing based hydrology, a major unanswered question is how to incorporate the impact of land-surface based heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics at remote sensing scales. The answer to this question is complicated since (1) soil moisture dynamics that vary with support, extent, and spacing scales are dependent on land-surface based heterogeneity and (2) land-surface based heterogeneity itself is scale-specific and varies with hydroclimates. Land-surface factors such as soil, vegetation, and topography affect soil moisture dynamics by redistributing the available soil moisture on the ground. In this study, we determined the contribution of these biophysical factors to redistribution of near-surface soil moisture across a range of remote sensing scales varying from an (airborne) remote sensor footprint (1.6 km) to a (satellite) footprint scale (25.6 km). Two-dimensional nondecimated wavelet transform was used to extract the support scale information from the spatial signals of the land-surface and soil moisture variables. The study was conducted in three hydroclimates: humid (Iowa), subhumid (Oklahoma), and semiarid (Arizona). The dominance of soil on soil moisture dynamics typically decreased from airborne to satellite footprint scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased with increasing support scale for all three hydroclimates. The distinct effect of hydroclimate was identifiable in the soil attributes dominating the soil moisture dynamics. The near-surface soil moisture dynamics in Arizona (semiarid) can be attributed more to the clay content which is an effective limiting parameter for evaporation whereas in Oklahoma (humid), sand content (limiting parameter for drainage) was the dominant soil attribute. The findings from this study can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics and the potential improvement of hydrological models operating at footprints' scales.

TI  - Improvement of multi-layer soil moisture prediction using support vector machines and ensemble {Kalman} filter coupled with remote sensing soil moisture datasets over an agriculture dominant basin in {China
VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil moisture prediction is of great importance in crop yield forecasting and drought monitoring. In this study, the multi-layer root zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - ABSTRACT Choice of stocking method may impact soil, plant, and animal responses. This 3-yr study evaluated stocking method effects on animal behavior and soil nutrient concentration in â€˜Pensacolaâ€™ bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum FlÃ¼gge) pastures. Stocking methods were continuous stocking and rotational stocking with 1-, 3-, 7-, and 21-d grazing periods and a 21-d resting period. Responses were measured in three zones based on distance from shade and water (Zone 1, 0â€“8 m; Zone 2, 8â€“16 m; Zone 3, {\textgreater}16 m). Indices were calculated to weight number of dung and urine events and time spent by cattle in a zone by the proportion of the total pasture and paddock area represented by that zone. Indices were most uniform (âˆ¼1) across zones for rotational stocking with short grazing periods and generally increased linearly in Zones 1 and 2 with increasing grazing period. Except for N, soil nutrient concentration was not affected by stocking method. In zones closest to shade and water, soil nutrients accumulated for all methods in the surface 8 cm but not in the 8- to 23-cm layer. Air temperature, wind speed, and temperatureâ€“humidity index explained 49\% of the variation in time cattle spent under shade, confirming the importance of the environment in animal behavior. In warm environments, structural features of stocking method (e.g., the position of shade and water) have a greater effect on animal behavior and distribution in the landscape than do stocking density-mediated effects on competition for forage.

TI  - Mapping variability of soil water content and flux across 1â€“1000 m scales using the {Actively} {Heated} {Fiber} {Optic} method
VL  - 50
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract The Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO) method is shown to be capable of measuring soil water content several times per hour at 0.25 m spacing along cables of multiple kilometers in length. AHFO is based on distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observation of the heating and cooling of a buried fiber-optic cable resulting from an electrical impulse of energy delivered from the steel cable jacket. The results presented were collected from 750 m of cable buried in three 240 m colocated transects at 30, 60, and 90 cm depths in an agricultural field under center pivot irrigation. The calibration curve relating soil water content to the thermal response of the soil to a heat pulse of 10 W mâˆ’1 for 1 min duration was developed in the lab. This calibration was found applicable to the 30 and 60 cm depth cables, while the 90 cm depth cable illustrated the challenges presented by soil heterogeneity for this technique. This method was used to map with high resolution the variability of soil water content and fluxes induced by the nonuniformity of water application at the surface.

TI  - A {Simple} {Method} for {Calibrating} {Dielectric} {Soil} {Moisture} {Sensors}: {Laboratory} {Validation} in {Sands
VL  - 10
SN  - NA
AB  - With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a two-point Î±-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types. A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types of ECH2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents (Î¸) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point Î±-mixing model was fitted to the Xâ€“Î¸ data and a fitting parameter, Î±, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely used sensors, the CS616 and the ThetaProbe ML2x, were also tested using the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers, including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were lumped into Î±. The value of Î± was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with high r2 values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models that require a large number of Xâ€“Î¸ data. After the Î± value is fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point Î±-mixing model requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values, i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point Î±-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or laboratory experiments.

VL  - 14
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil spatial heterogeneity poses a challenge to accurate soil moisture determination. Remote sensing, in particular, using sensors that acquire data at microwave frequencies, is being used to overcome this challenge. In situ soil moisture monitoring can be used to validate remotely sensed surface soil moisture estimates and as inputs for agronomic and hydrologic models. Nine in situ soil moisture stations were established in Manitoba (Canada) and instrumented with Stevens Hydra Probes. The sensors were installed in triplicate with vertical orientation at the surface and with horizontal orientation at the 5-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm depths. To ensure accuracy of the measured soil moisture, both laboratory and field calibrations were conducted. These calibrated soil moisture values were compared with the probe default values and those generated using published calibrations. Overall, the results showed that the field calibration was superior (coefficient of determination r2 of 0.95) to the laboratory calibration (r2 of 0.89). In addition, coarse-textured sites generally performed better than the fine-textured, high cation exchange capacity (CEC) sites. At the Kelburn site with high clay and CEC, the use of field calibration reduced the root mean square error from 0.188 to 0.026 m3 mâˆ’3. However, at the low clay and CEC Treherne site, gains in accuracy were minimal, about 0.005 m3 mâˆ’3. The laboratory calibration consistently underestimated soil moisture at all the evaluation sites, whereas both Topp and Logsdon calibrations overestimated soil moisture.

VL  - 2010

AB  - The experiment was conducted at the Forestry Research Center, Ethiopia in 2008. Soil was sampled under the canopy of Hagenia abyssinica and from farmland area adjacent to the forest to measure fertility of soils by using the biotest with linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as indicators. The experimental design was a completely randomized design comprising of 20 seedlings per study site. Seeds were seeded into polythene plastic bags. Seedling emergence, germination, and survival rate were recorded. Plant height and root collar diameter were measured. Final weight of fresh biomass was measured, and each component was oven-dried at 70Â°C. Dry weight was recorded at constant weight. Significant differences (P {\textless} .05) were observed between soil treatments. Plants grown on Hagenia-influenced soils attained better performance, suggesting the beneficial role of Hagenia abyssinica in enhancing soil fertility status which in turn results in higher productivity.

VL  - 8
SN  - NA
AB  - ABSTRACT Large area integrated soil moisture measurement results are often required for meteorological studies as well as for geological, agricultural and natural disaster research. Commonly used sensors measure the soil moisture locally and exhibit a strong spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of most land surfaces. The new â€˜Free Line Sensingâ€™ technology uses existing high-voltage power lines to detect variations in soil moisture below the lines. The electromagnetic field of an additional radio-frequency signal in the range of 50â€“500 kHz on the line is influenced by changes in the electric properties of the soil, e.g., after rainfall. This has been simulated using high-frequency software, the result being that variations of electrical conductivity or dielectric coefficient of the soil will lead to a measurable effect with power line sections extending over several kilometres. Measurements have been conducted on a 13 km long high-voltage power line. The resulting signal is evaluated with respect to amplitude and phase. Measurement data demonstrate the capability of the â€˜Free Line Sensorâ€™ to monitor the integrated soil moisture of the Earthâ€™s surface and near subsurface over the area covered by the power line. The resulting signal of the â€˜Free Line Sensorâ€™ strongly responds to precipitation events and the following drying of the soil. Comparison with soil moisture data obtained from gravimetric drying of soil samples reveals a good agreement.

TI  - Experimental validation of the soil fertility hypothesis in a natural {Mediterranean} tri-trophic system
VL  - 169
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Host plant resources are a major issue in gall-insect ecology. Soil fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that were not fertilized (â€˜poor soilâ€™) and others that were fertilized with NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions. Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on galling-insect ecology.

TI  - Calibration, measurement, and characterization of soil moisture dynamics in a central {Amazonian} tropical forest
VL  - 19
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate soil moisture measurements in remote ecosystems such as the Amazon are difficult and limited because of logistical constraints. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are widely used to monitor soil moisture and require calibration to convert the TDR's dielectric permittivity measurement (Ka) to volumetric water content (Î¸v). In this study, our objectives were to develop a field-based calibration of TDR sensors in an old-growth upland forest in the central Amazon, to evaluate the performance of the calibration, and then to apply the calibration to determine the dynamics of soil moisture content within a 14.2-m-deep vertical soil profile. Depth-specific TDR calibration using local soils in a controlled laboratory setting yielded a novel Kaâ€“Î¸v third-degree polynomial calibration. The sensors were later installed to their specific calibration depth in a 14.2-m pit. The widely used Kaâ€“Î¸v relationship (Topp model) underestimated the site-specific Î¸v by 22â€“42\%, indicating significant error in the model when applied to these well-structured, clay-rich tropical forest soils. The calibrated wet- and dry-season Î¸v data showed a variety of depth and temporal variations highlighting the importance of soil textural differentiation, root uptake depths, as well as event to seasonal precipitation effects. Data such as these are greatly needed for improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes within tropical forests and for improving models of these systems in the face of changing environmental conditions.

TI  - The measurement and quantification of generalized gradients of soil fertility relevant to plant community ecology
VL  - 100
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract We propose an operational definition of soil â€œfertilityâ€ that is applicable to plant community ecology and develop a method of measuring and quantifying it, using structural equations modeling, that is generalizable to soils in different regions whose fertility has different causes. To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent â€œgeneralized fertility,â€ FG, of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of FG in this study were the supply rates of NO3âˆ’, P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The FG values predicted 51\% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.

TI  - 15N} fate in maize cropping system in response to black soil fertility improvement in {China
VL  - 113
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Applications of high amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer are essential for obtaining sustainable maize (Zea mays L.) yields but also result in low N-use efficiency (NUE) and cause a series of environmental problems. To optimize fertilizer management, it is necessary to determine the effects of soil fertility improvement on NUE and the fate of N fertilizer. In this study, we conducted a 15N tracer pot experiment involving five different fertilizer treatments in soils with five different total organic carbon levels under field conditions. The average NUE ranged from 36 to 56\% 15N-urea and 0.1 to 0.2\% residual N in the first and second seasons. The N retained in the soil ranged from 10 to 28\%, and the N lost to water and the atmosphere ranged from 29 to 39\% in the five soils. Compared with that in the low-fertility soils, NUE in the high-fertility soils was 20â€“45\% greater, and N loss was 1 â€“6\% lower. The results showed that higher soil fertility corresponded to higher NUE and lower N loss. We suggest that although the local customary N fertilizer application rate (N3; 165 kg N/ha) in the study area is reasonable for low-fertility soils, after soil fertility improvements, an approximately 50\% reduction of N fertilizer should be implemented.

TI  - Estimating {Soil} {Moisture} {Patterns} with {Remote} {Sensing} and {Terrain} {Data} at the {Small} {Catchment} {Scale
VL  - 16
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas The FCM SEA was used for sampling and spatial estimation of soil moisture patterns. Multispectral remote sensing and terrain data were combined to guide the sampling and estimation. Selected vegetation patterns and terrain data provided reasonable estimates of soil moisture. The FCM SEA was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance. The FCM SEA was superior to an approach driven solely by terrain data. Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment characteristics (e.g., terrain and land use) that can be used as proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture database for the SchÃ¤fertal catchment, located in central Germany, was used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58\% of the cases and was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale.

TI  - Hyperspectral response and monitoring study of soil moisture content based on the optimized spectral index
VL  - 87
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil moisture controls the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere and significantly affects plant growth and productivity. Hyperspectral (350â€“2500 nm) monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) could provide a theoretical basis for the real-time estimation of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture. During this study, we have developed SMC prediction models in different soil moisture ranges by using the combination of spectral preprocessing methods and optimized spectral indices. Results indicated that first-order derivative (FD) preprocessing method can highlight the effective information of the spectra and improve the correlation between spectral reflectance and SMC. The spectral reflectance exhibited a strong correlation with SMC near 1400, 1700, 1900, and 2200 nm. The FD-NDSI-W0-model had the best SMC prediction and applicability (R2 = 0.977, root mean square error = 3.413\%, relative percent deviation = 6.171) to predict SMCs. Overall, pretreatment methods, combined with the two-band random combination to optimize the spectral index to build a prediction model of SMC, could be applied for accurate monitoring of SMC.

VL  - 53
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract We describe a soil water content monitoring data set and auxiliary data collected at a 37 ha experimental no-till farm in the Northwestern United States. Water content measurements have been compiled hourly since 2007 by ECH2O-TE and 5TE sensors installed at 42 locations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m, 210 sensors total) across the R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm, a Long-Term Agro-Ecosystem Research Site stationed on complex terrain in a Mediterranean climate. In addition to soil water content readings, the data set includes hourly and daily soil temperature readings, annual crop histories, a digital elevation model, Bt horizon maps, seasonal apparent electrical conductivity, soil texture, and soil bulk density. Meteorological records are also available for this location. We discuss the unique challenges of maintaining the network on an operating farm and demonstrate the nature and complexity of the soil water content data. This data set is accessible online through the National Agriculture Library, has been assigned a DOI, and will be maintained for the long term.

VL  - 186
SN  - NA
AB  - Riceâ€“wheat cropping system to which graded levels of NPK fertilizers had been applied for 20 years were compared for yield trends, and changes in response function, soil organic-C and available N, P, K and S status. This study of system in which only chemical fertilizers had been used over a long period enabled long-term yield declines of rice and wheat at different levels and combinations of NPK fertilizers to be evaluated. The highest rate of yield decline in both rice and wheat was found when 120 kg haâˆ’1 N was applied alone. The lowest rate of decline was observed when all three nutrients (N, P and K) were applied, at 40, 35 and 33 kg haâˆ’1 for N, P and K, respectively, followed by 120, 35 and 33 kg haâˆ’1 (currently recommended levels). The yield response of rice and wheat to N fertilizer declined over the 20 years, with a higher rate of decline in wheat. In contrast, the response to applied P and K increased with time in both crops, with a higher response rate in wheat. With continuous application of N and P fertilizers, there was a marginal change in available N and K in the soil over time, but an approximately 3-fold increase in available P and an approximately 2-fold increase in available S were obtained by regular dressing of P fertilizer (SSP: 7 \% P, 12 \% S) over 20 years. The results revealed that balanced, high doses of NPK fertilizers are required to maintain soil fertility and raise grain yields.

TI  - Quantifying the change in soil moisture modeling uncertainty from remote sensing observations using {Bayesian} inference techniques
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Operational land surface models (LSMs) compute hydrologic states such as soil moisture that are needed for a range of important applications (e.g., drought, flood, and weather prediction). The uncertainty in LSM parameters is sufficiently great that several researchers have proposed conducting parameter estimation using globally available remote sensing data to identify best fit local parameter sets. However, even with in situ data at fine modeling scales, there can be significant remaining uncertainty in LSM parameters and outputs. Here, using a new uncertainty estimation subsystem of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) (described herein), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is applied to conduct Bayesian analysis for the accounting of parameter uncertainties. The Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) MCMC algorithm was applied, for which a new parallel implementation was developed. A case study is examined that builds on previous work in which the Noah LSM was calibrated to passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing estimates of soil moisture for the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. In keeping with prior related studies, the parameters subjected to the analysis were restricted to the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The main goal is to estimate SHPs and soil moisture simulation uncertainty before and after consideration of the remote sensing data. The prior SHP uncertainty is based on the original source of the standard SHP lookup tables for the Noah LSM. Conclusions are drawn regarding the value and viability of Bayesian analysis over alternative approaches (e.g., parameter estimation, lookup tables) and further research needs are identified.

TI  - Design and performance of a wireless sensor network for catchment-scale snow and soil moisture measurements
VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - A wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed as part of a water balance instrument cluster across a forested 1 km2headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The network, which integrates readings from over 300 sensors, provides spatially representative measurements of snow depth, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. The ability of this densely instrumented watershed to capture catchment-scale snow depth and soil moisture distributions is investigated through comparison with three comprehensive gridded surveys and 1 day of detailed lidar snow data. Statistical analysis shows that the network effectively characterized catchment-wide distributions of snow depth, while offering a cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient means for collecting distributed data in real time. A temporal analysis of snow depth variability reveals that canopy cover is the major explanatory variable of snow depth and that under-canopy measurements persistently show higher variability compared to those in open terrain. An analysis of soil moisture shows lower variability at deeper soil depth and a correlation between mean soil moisture and variability for shallow soils. A three-phase design procedure was used to optimize the WSN deployment. First, as off-the-shelf performance of current WSN platforms for large-scale, long-term deployments cannot be guaranteed, statistics from a prototype deployment were analyzed. Two indicators of network performance, the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator, showed that for our site conditions, a conservative 50 m node-to-node spacing would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. Second, results from the prototype were used to refine hardware specifications and to guide the layout of the full 57-node wireless network. Of these nodes, 23 were used actively for sensing, while the remaining 34 nodes were used as signal repeaters to ensure proper spatial radio coverage and robust network operations. Further analysis of network statistics is conducted during the third, operational, phase to validate system performance.

VL  - 2012
SN  - NA
AB  - Cassava is an important starchy staple crop in Ghana with per capita consumption of 152.9 kg/year. Besides being a staple food crop, cassava can be used as raw material for the production of industrial starch and ethanol. The potential of cassava as an industrial commercial crop has not been exploited to a large extent because of perceptions that cassava depletes soils. Recent finding from field studies in the forest/savannah transitional agroecological zone of Ghana indicates that when integrated in the cropping system as a form of rotation, cassava contributes significantly to maintenance of soil fertility, and thus large scale production of cassava for industrial use can contribute to poverty reduction in an environmentally responsive way. This paper discusses the role of cassava cultivation in soil fertility management and its implication for farming system sustainability and industrialization.

TI  - Emerging methods for noninvasive sensing of soil moisture dynamics from field to catchment scale: a review
VL  - 2
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial system because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this study, we review recent advances in noninvasive techniques that allow continuous noninvasive and contactless measurements of soil moisture dynamics at the field to basin scale. In particular, we report on (1) cosmic-ray neutron probes, (2) Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry, (3) ground-based microwave radiometry, (4) gamma-ray monitoring, (5) terrestrial gravimetry, and (6) low-frequency electromagnetic surface waves. Each method is described in terms of its basic principle, measurement scales, calibration issues, measurement accuracy, and applications. We hope that this review will further stimulate the community to invest in the continued development of novel soil moisture sensing methods that address the need for large-scale soil water content measurements with sufficiently high temporal resolution.

TI  - An examination of direct ground wave soil moisture monitoring over an annual cycle of soil conditions
VL  - 46
SN  - NA
AB  - Direct ground wave (DGW) measurements obtained with ground-penetrating radar have been used in a number of previous studies to estimate volumetric water content in the shallow soil zone; however, these studies have generally involved controlled field experiments or measurements collected across limited natural ranges of soil moisture conditions. To further investigate the capacity of this method, we have undertaken an extensive field study using multifrequency (i.e., 225, 450, and 900 MHz) DGW measurements to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil water content variations typical of midlatitude climates at three sites with different soil textures. The use of common-midpoint surveys allowed us to understand the nature and evolution of the near-surface electromagnetic wavefields and their impact on DGW moisture predictions. We present the novel characterization of a wide-range of seasonal moisture dynamics including soil freezing and thawing process using multifrequency DGW measurements for a range of soil textures. These data showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface wavefield and multifrequency DGW velocities corresponding to both seasonal and shorter-term variations in soil conditions. Although all of the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil water contents, which were controlled by the soil textural properties. Although there were no observed systematic differences in DGW velocities due to frequency dispersion for the 225â€“900 MHz range, the DGW measurements obtained using higher-frequency antennas was less impacted by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse duration. DGW velocity measurements combined with an appropriate dielectric mixing formula provided quantitative predictions of soil water content that accurately replicated the soil sample data over the annual cycle of moisture conditions.

VL  - 41
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Using a decade of ground-based soil moisture observations acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture's Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), we calculate the mutual information (MI) content between multiple soil moisture variables and near-future vegetation condition to examine the existence of emergent drought information in vertically integrated (surface to 60 cm) soil moisture observations (Î¸0â€“60 [cm]) not present in either superficial soil moisture observations (Î¸5 [cm]) or a simple low-pass transformation of Î¸5. Results suggest that while Î¸0â€“60 is indeed more valuable than Î¸5 for predicting near-future vegetation anomalies, the enhanced information content in Î¸0â€“60 soil moisture can be effectively duplicated by the low-pass transformation of Î¸5. This implies that, for drought monitoring applications, the shallow vertical penetration depth of microwave-based Î¸5 retrievals does not represent as large a practical limitation as commonly perceived.

VL  - 55

AB  - Abstract Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil moisture infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale drought monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network program is the development of a near real-time drought monitoring product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing data. Data integration from diverse sources requires large-scale validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land surface models; and Soil Moisture Active-Passive, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive L3 is the remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil moisture data set in any region of the world.

TI  - Permanentâ€“soil monitoring sites for documentation of soil-fertility development after changing from conventional to organic farming
VL  - 169
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract For monitoring soil fertility after changing farm management from highly conventional to organic farming on the newly established research farm of Kassel University, two permanentâ€“soil monitoring sites were installed in 1999. Representative locations for installing the permanentâ€“soil monitoring sites were selected using geographical information systems (GIS), based on available data from geology, topography, soil taxation, land use, and intensive auger-borehole records and analysis with a very high spatial resolution of data. The soils are represented by a Luvisol derived from loess and a Vertisol developed from claystone. The soil properties of the two monitoring sites measured immediately after changing to organic farming showed high contents of extractable nutrients as a result of the former intensive fertilization practice during conventional farm management. The microbial soil properties of the two monitoring sites were in the medium range of regional soils. A first evaluation of the development of soil properties was done after 5 y of monitoring. The soil organic-matter content increased slightly after grass-clover and after application of farmyard manure. The amounts of K and P decreased clearly at the loess site without application of farmyard manure. At the clay site, the unique application of farmyard manure led to increasing contents of extractable K and P in the top soil. The variation of soil properties increased clearly after perennial crops like grass-clover and in years after application of farmyard manure.

TI  - Soil moisture monitoring in mountain areas by using high-resolution {SAR} images: results from a feasibility study
VL  - 65
SN  - NA
AB  - Summary This paper presents the results of a two-year experiment carried out in mountain areas on soil moisture retrieval from remotely sensed images. In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, SÃ¼dtirol region, northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data. This work was carried out with the main aim of demonstrating the feasibility of soil moisture retrieval in mountain areas with high-resolution images in view of the upcoming Sentinel 1 mission.

TI  - Comparison of soil moisture products from microwave remote sensing, land model, and reanalysis using global ground observations
VL  - 34
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract High-quality soil moisture (SM) datasets are in great demand for climate, hydrology, and other fields, but detailed evaluation of SM products from various sources is scarce. Thus, using 670 SM stations worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote sensing [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data [ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54) correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b) Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales, and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in Decemberâ€“February and Juneâ€“August, respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the accuracy of the above SM products.

TI  - Development of a deterministic downscaling algorithm for remote sensing soil moisture footprint using soil and vegetation classifications
VL  - 49
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) at the local scale is required to account for small-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface because many hydrological processes manifest at scales ranging from cm to km. Although remote sensing (RS) platforms provide large-scale soil moisture dynamics, scale discrepancy between observation scale (e.g., approximately several kilometers) and modeling scale (e.g., few hundred meters) leads to uncertainties in the performance of land surface hydrologic models. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new deterministic downscaling algorithm (DDA) for estimating fine-scale soil moisture with pixel-based RS soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) products using a genetic algorithm. This approach was evaluated under various synthetic and field experiments (Little Washita-LW 13 and 21, Oklahoma) conditions including homogeneous and heterogeneous land surface conditions composed of different soil textures and vegetations. Our algorithm is based on determining effective soil hydraulic properties for different subpixels within a RS pixel and estimating the long-term soil moisture dynamics of individual subpixels using the hydrological model with the extracted soil hydraulic parameters. The soil moisture dynamics of subpixels from synthetic experiments matched well with the observations under heterogeneous land surface condition, although uncertainties (Mean Bias Error, MBE: âˆ’0.073 to âˆ’0.049) exist. Field experiments have typically more variations due to weather conditions, measurement errors, unknown bottom boundary conditions, and scale discrepancy between remote sensing pixel and model grid resolution. However, the soil moisture estimates of individual subpixels (from the airborne Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) footprints of 800 m Ã— 800 m) downscaled by this approach matched well (R: 0.724 to âˆ’0.914, MBE: âˆ’0.203 to âˆ’0.169 for the LW 13; R: 0.343â€“0.865, MBE: âˆ’0.165 to âˆ’0.122 for the LW 21) with the in situ local scale soil moisture measurements during Southern Great Plains Experiment 1997 (SGP97). The good correspondence of observed soil water characteristics Î¸(h) functions (from the soil core samples) and genetic algorithm (GA) searched soil parameters at the LW 13 and 21 sites demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. Although the algorithm is tested under limited conditions at field scale, this approach improves the availability of remotely sensed soil moisture product at finer resolution for various land surface and hydrological model applications.

VL  - 12
SN  - NA
AB  - Calibration/validation experiments are critical to developing and testing soil moisture retrieval algorithms from microwave remote sensing platforms. Ground sampling must be optimally designed to minimize sources of error or bias during data collection. An important consideration in the design of ground sampling campaigns is that the in situ measured soil moisture is representative of the retrieval depth of a microwave sensor. Because of the popularity of portable impedance probe instruments, volumetric soil moisture is usually measured at a constant depth of approximately 0 to 6 cm and aggregated over a spatial extent representative of a pixel footprint. However, the retrieval depth of microwave signals can vary, and in agricultural soils is typically representative of the top âˆ¼5 cm (or less) of the soil surface. It is unknown whether this mismatch between the depth of ground measured soil moisture and microwave retrieved soil moisture significantly contributes to error during sensor calibration/validation. This issue is addressed based on an analysis of over 3400 impedance probe measurements collected in 72 agricultural fields over four sampling occasions. Volumetric soil moisture was measured at depths of approximately 6 and 3 cm, at 24 locations in each field. The observed soil moisture sampling distributions and statistical moments are compared between these two measurement depths. Results demonstrate that the majority of fields exhibit a near-normal sampling distribution at both the 6- (60 of 72) and 3-cm (59 of 72) depths. An average difference of 0.016 m3 mâˆ’3 exists between all field means, generally indicating that wetter measurements are observed from the samples at 6 cm than those at 3 cm. Statistically significant differences were found between the measurement depths for field means (23 of 72), distributions (21 of 72), and variances (9 of 72). These findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing near-surface volumetric soil moisture spatial and depth variability effects during ground sampling experiments to minimize error in calibration/validation of retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Mapping spatiotemporal soil moisture in highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes using mobile dual-spectra cosmic-ray neutron sensing
VL  - 22
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) maps are crucial for catchment-scale hydrological models used for water resource management and warning systems for droughts, floods, and wildfires. SM can be mapped by mobile cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) systems of moderated detectors at homogeneous landscapes of similar soil and vegetation. In this study, we present a new approach for mobile CRN detection to perform to its full potential, where CRN measurements can also be converted to SM at heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is based solely on thermal and epithermal neutron datasets obtained from mobile dual-spectra CRN detection, combined with theoretical developments using a particle transport model. For each measurement point, the land cover type is identified using the thermal-to-epithermal (T/E) ratio, and the relevant neutron-count-to-soil-moisture conversion function is estimated from CRN stations located at the main land cover types in the catchment. With this approach, the requirement of collecting 100+ soil samples for each point along the survey route is omitted. We use this T/E-dependent approach to obtain SM maps from 12 CRN surveys and compare it with a simple approach where only the conversion function from the agricultural site is used. SM by the simple approach is comparable to the estimates of the agricultural stations of a capacitance sensor network, while the estimates of the T/E-dependent approach also compare well with the heathland and forest stations. With accurate SM estimates for all landcover types, the average error is reduced from 0.089 to 0.038 when comparing CRN SM with space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission estimates.

VL  - 52
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract This study demonstrated a new method for mapping high-resolution (spatial: 1 m, and temporal: 1 h) soil moisture by assimilating distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observed soil temperatures at intermediate scales. In order to provide robust soil moisture and property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by maximizing the reliability of the soil temperature estimates of each batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation.

VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas Stem water content of trees was successfully monitored using GS3 capacitance sensors. Temperature calibration was essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data. The monitoring clarified water use characteristics of the trees in arid environments. Dielectric soil moisture sensors have the potential for nondestructive and real-time monitoring of the stem water content (Î¸st) of living trees. This study was conducted to investigate the water use characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of Î¸st using newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species. Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of Î¸st caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of Î¸st in arid environments. The Î¸st of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The Î¸st of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The Î¸st of the tamarisk decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.

AB  - The combination of wireless sensor networks and radio technology can form a new type of communication network. The emergence of wireless sensor networks has effectively solved the problems existing in radio technology, but traditional wireless sensor networks and radio technology networks cannot be directly applied to wireless sensors. On this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil nutrient variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of statistical quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a given location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze the relationship between several natural factors and quantitative estimation of soil protection. Based on wireless sensor technology, this paper studies the variability of farmland soil nutrients and statistical quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a foundation for the development of agriculture and statistics.

TI  - Comparative assessment of soil moisture estimation from land surface model and satellite remote sensing based on catchment water balance
VL  - 21
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Land surface models and satellite remote sensing are among the modern soil moisture retrieval techniques that can be used over large areas. However, the lack of â€˜ground truthâ€™ soil moisture measurements is still an obstacle in the evaluation and validation of soil moisture retrievals. In this study, a new scheme is used to assess soil moisture retrieval from both the NOAH Land surface Model (LSM) coupled with the fifth generation Mesoscale Model MM5 and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer AMSR-E. The proposed scheme is based on the strong correlation between changes in soil storage from rainfall runoff events and changes in the retrieved soil moisture either from the MM5-NOAH LSM or the AMSR-E. The aim of this study is to compare the application of the proposed scheme between these two different approaches for soil moisture estimation. The MM5-NOAH LSM provides soil moisture estimations at three different layers with depths 0â€“10 cm (surface layer 1), 10â€“40 cm (layer 2) and 40â€“100 cm (layer 3). In this study, the combined soil moisture over the top two layers (first and second) and the combined soil moisture over the first three layers (first, second and third) are used to account for the entire soil column for assessing the estimated soil moisture using changes in the storage from the water balance. The results have shown that the MM5 soil moisture from the combined top two layers has the better performance than either of the individual layers when compared to the catchment water storage. The results also show that the MM5-NOAH LSM soil moisture estimates have a slightly better performance than the AMSR-E surface soil moisture measurement. This preliminary assessment shows the benefits of using hydrological data in the validation of soil moisture retrieval methods. Copyright Â© 2013 Royal Meteorological Society

VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Integrated cropâ€“livestock systems directly link crop and livestock production together to generate positive economic and environmental outcomes. Some methods used in integrated systems, like winter grazing on cropland, could negatively affect soil properties and crop productivity. We compared soil compaction, corn (Zea mays L.) yield, and soil nutrient pools between an integrated cropâ€“livestock system and continuous corn system to address this issue. The study was conducted near Pana, IL, between 2002 and 2006. Soil compaction was evaluated indirectly by measuring soil penetration resistance (PR) and surface CO2 effluxes. Total soil C, N, and microbial biomass C, were measured from 2002 to 2005. Soil PR and CO2 effluxes showed inconsistent trends related to soil compaction and cattle presence. Corn yield from 2004 to 2006 was higher (P = 0.01) in the integrated system (11.6 Mg haâˆ’1) compared with continuous corn (10.6 Mg haâˆ’1). Total soil C concentration increased significantly from 2002 to 2005 within components of the integrated system but remained unchanged in continuous corn. Microbial biomass C was also higher in the integrated system but only in 2005. The study determined that integration of crops with livestock had generally positive effects on crop yield and soil organic matter despite the potential for livestock to compact soil during winter grazing.

AB  - Abstract To understand surface biogeophysical processes, accurately evaluating the geographical and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture is crucial. It is well known that the surface soil moisture content (SMC) affects soil reflectance at all solar spectrum wavelengths. Therefore, future satellite missions, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, will be essential for mapping and monitoring global soil moisture changes. Our study compares two widely used moisture retrieval models: the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance (MARMIT) and the soil water parametric (SWAP)-Hapke model. We evaluated the SMC retrieval accuracy of these models using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) hyperspectral imagery and goniometer hyperspectral data. Laboratory analysis employed hyperspectral goniometer data of sediment samples from four locations reflecting diverse environments, while field validation used hyperspectral UAS imaging and coordinated ground truth collected in 2018 and 2019 from a barrier island beach at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site. The (SWAP)-Hapke model achieves comparable accuracy to MARMIT using laboratory hyperspectral data but is less accurate when applied to UAS hyperspectral imagery than the MARMIT model. We proposed a modified version of the (SWAP)-Hapke model, which achieves better results than MARMIT when applied to laboratory spectral measurements; however, MARMIT's performance is still more accurate when applied to UAS imagery. These results are likely due to differences in the models' descriptions of multiply-scattered light and MARMIT's more detailed description of air-water interactions.

VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - Surface soil moisture content is highly variable in both space and time. While remote sensing provides an effective methodology for mapping surface moisture content over large areas, it averages within-pixel variability thereby masking the underlying heterogeneity observed at the land surface. This variability must be better understood in order to rigorously evaluate sensor performance and to enhance the utility of the larger-scale remotely sensed averages by quantifying the underlying variability that remote sensing cannot record explicitly. In support of the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment (a surface soil moisture mapping mission conducted between June 18 and July 17, 1997, in central Oklahoma) an investigation was conducted to characterize soil moisture variability within remote sensing footprints (approximately 0.64 km2) with more certainty than would be afforded with conventional gravimetric moisture content sampling. Nearly every day during the experiment period, portable impedance probes were used to intensively monitor volumetric moisture content in the 0- to 6-cm surface soil layer at six footprint-sized fields scattered over the SGP97 study area. A minimum of 49 daily moisture content measurements were made on most fields. Higher-resolution grid and transect data were also collected periodically. In total, more than 11,000 impedance probe measurements of volumetric moisture content were made at the six sites by over 35 SGP97 participants. The wide spatial distribution of the sites, combined with the intensive, near-daily monitoring, provided a unique opportunity (relative to previous smaller-scale and shorter-duration soil moisture studies) to characterize variations in surface moisture content over a range of wetness conditions. In this paper the range and temporal dynamics of the variability in moisture content within each of the six fields are described, as are general relationships between the variability and footprint-mean moisture content. Results indicate that distinct differences in mean moisture content between the six sites are consistent with variations in soil type, vegetation cover, and rainfall gradients. Within fields the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis increased with decreasing moisture content; the distribution of surface moisture content evolved from negatively skewed/nonnormal under very wet conditions, to normal in the midrange of mean moisture content, to positively skewed/nonnormal under dry conditions; and agricultural practices of row tilling and terracing were shown to exert a major control on observed moisture content variations. Results presented here can be utilized to better evaluate sensor performance, to extrapolate estimates of subgrid-scale variations in moisture content across the entire SGP97 region, and in the parameterization of soil moisture dynamics in hydrological and land surface models.

VL  - 7

AB  - Abstract Soil moisture (SM) is an important index of soil drought, and it directly controls the energy balance and water cycle of the land surface. As an indicator and amplifier of global warming, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is becoming warmer and wetter. Because of its particular geographical environment, large-scale measurements of SM on the TP can only be achieved by satellite remote sensing. The resolution of current SM product of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is 36 km, which is insufficient for many practical applications. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are applied to increase the resolution of SM down to 1 km using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The preliminary results of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by station observations and other reanalysis products. The downscaled results are more consistent with the in situ observations, the Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) from China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) than the original SMAP product. The downscaling algorithm is most effective for grasslands. It is demonstrated that high-resolution SM products can be generated by fusing various features using machine-learning algorithms.

We objectively validate this claim by calculating the strength of the relationship between storm-scale runoff ratio (i.e., total streamflow divided by total rainfall accumulation in depth units) and prestorm surface soil moisture estimates from a range of surface soil moisture data products. Results demonstrate that both satellite-based, L band microwave radiometry and the application of land data assimilation techniques have significantly improved the utility of surface soil moisture data sets for forecasting streamflow response to future rainfall events.

TI  - Evaluation of a surface energy balance method based on optical and thermal satellite imagery to estimate root-zone soil moisture
VL  - 29
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

TI  - Interaction effects of environmental factors on soil nitrogen fractions based on a novel sequential extraction method
VL  - 73
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors. However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction methods. The Harbinâ€“Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N. The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material, aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-, cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs. Highlights Soil nitrogen fractions (SNFs) were fractionated via a novel sequential extraction method. Increasing MAT decreased the H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N concentrations. Interactions of climate, parent material and vegetation affected 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N. H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl- and cHCl-N are sensitive SNFs that reflect environmental changes.

AB  - Core Ideas Soil moisture sensors have varying accuracies that can be improved with calibration. In situ sensors require scaling to improve their representativeness of large areas. Soil moisture sensors in profile have decreasing ability to accurately represent the surface soil moisture. In situ soil moisture monitoring networks are critical to the development of soil moisture remote sensing missions as well as agricultural and environmental management, weather forecasting, and many other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0.04 m3 mâˆ’3. For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m3 mâˆ’3.

TI  - The use of remote sensing indices to understand flood-recharged soil moisture impacts on trees in semi-arid floodplains: {A} review
VL  - 15
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM) and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic, ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore, available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.

VL  - 58

AB  - Abstract Increasing interest in studying the variability of soil water content and its spatial scale dependency necessitates the development of new techniques to accurately monitor soil water over a wide range of spatial scales. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m3 mâˆ’3 using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions.

TI  - Estimating water balance components in irrigated agriculture using a combined approach of soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, and numerical modelling
VL  - 35
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from irrigation.

VL  - 54
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55 km2 Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9 ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric SAR soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy.

VL  - 58
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Surface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, âˆ’0.001, and 0.041 , respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13\%, 7\%, 22\%, and 18\%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.

VL  - 11
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract A theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) for electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric materials is proposed and applied to simultaneously retrieving soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC) from L-band microwave brightness temperature (TB). One representation of the MEP principle states that a non-equilibrium system corresponds to such a configuration of energy fluxes that minimizes a dissipation function under the constraint of energy conservation. The dissipation function for radiative transfer is formulated as an analogy of that for heat transfer. A new physical parameter, radiative inertia as an analogy of thermal inertia, is introduced to characterize radiative attenuation in dielectric media. The radiative inertia is parameterized in terms of the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves as a function of the complex dielectric constant. The MEP based retrieval algorithm predicts SM and VWC by minimizing the dissipation function under the constraint of the conservation of radiative energy. The retrievals of SM and VWC based on the MEP theory were validated against field observations in tropical and temperate forested regions of the Amazon and North America. The proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates the capability of the MEP algorithm for simultaneous retrievals of SM and VWC even for dense canopy (e.g., VWC {\textgreater} 5 kg mâˆ’2). The MEP method is a new theoretical framework for developing innovative remote sensing algorithms of the Earth system not limited to microwave observations.

VL  - 1
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract Soil moisture information is essential to monitoring of the intensity of droughts, the start of the rainy season, planting dates and early warnings of yield losses. We assess spatial and temporal trends of drought over the Brazilian semiarid region by combining soil moisture observations from 360 stations, root zone soil moisture from a leading land surface model, and a vegetation health index from remote sensing. The soil moisture dataset was obtained from the network of stations maintained by the National Center of Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden), in Brazil. Soil water content at 10 to 35 cm depth, for the period 1979â€“2018, was obtained from running the JULES land surface model (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator). The modelled soil moisture was correlated with measurements in the common period of 2015â€“2018, resulting in an average correlation coefficient of 0.48 across the domain. The standardized soil moisture anomaly (SMA) was calculated for the long-term modelled soil moisture and revealed strong negative values during well-known drought periods in the region, especially during El-NiÃ±o years. The performance of SMA in identifying droughts during the first 2 months of the raining and cropping season was similar to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), commonly used for drought assessment: 12â€“14 events were identified by both indices. Finally, the temporal relationship between both SMA and SPI with the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) was assessed using the cross-wavelet transform. The results indicated lagged correlations of 1 to 1.5 months in the annual scale, suggesting that negative trends in SMA and SPI can be an early warning to yield losses during the growing season. Public policies on drought assessment should consider the combination of multiple drought indices, including soil moisture anomaly.

TI  - Evaluation of multiple surface soil moisture for {Korean} regional flux monitoring network sites: {Advanced} {Microwave} {Scanning} {Radiometer} {E}, land surface model, and ground measurements
VL  - 26
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract In the past few decades, there have been great developments in remotely sensed soil moisture, with validation efforts using land surface models (LSMs) and ground-based measurements, because soil moisture information is essential to understanding complex land surfaceâ€“atmosphere interactions. However, the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture has been very limited because of the scarcity of the ground measurements in Korea. This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0Â·10â€“0Â·14 m3 mâˆ’3 and wet BIAS = 0Â·09 âˆ’ 0Â·04 m3 mâˆ’3) with the CLM and ground-based measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized by complex geophysical conditions. Additional evaluations should be required to facilitate the use of recent and forthcoming remotely sensed soil moisture data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive missions at representative future validation sites.

AB  - Optimal soil moisture estimation may be characterized by intercomparisons among remotely sensed measurements, ground-based measurements, and land surface models. In this study, we compared soil moisture from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E), ground-based measurements, and a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) model for the Soil Moisture Experiments in 2003 (SMEX03) Little River region, Georgia. The Common Land Model (CLM) reasonably replicated soil moisture patterns in dry down and wetting after rainfall though it had modest wet biases (0.001â€“0.054 m3/m3) as compared to AMSR-E and ground data. While the AMSR-E average soil moisture agreed well with the other data sources, it had extremely low temporal variability, especially during the growing season from May to October. The comparison results showed that highest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.054 and 0.059 m3/m3 for short and long periods, respectively. Even if CLM and AMSR-E had complementary strengths, low MAE (0.018â€“0.054 m3/m3) and RMSE (0.023â€“0.059 m3/m3) soil moisture errors for CLM and soil moisture low biases (0.003â€“0.031 m3/m3) for AMSR-E, care should be taken prior to employing AMSR-E retrieved soil moisture products directly for hydrological application due to its failure to replicate temporal variability. AMSR-E error characteristics identified in this study should be used to guide enhancement of retrieval algorithms and improve satellite observations for hydrological sciences.

VL  - 2022
SN  - NA
AB  - Soil nutrient balance is affected by nutrient management in crops. A poor nutrient management technique results in an imbalance in the soil nutrient status which could have a long-term negative impact on crop production. The current study was carried out to assess the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on soil nutrient balance in a maize-wheat cropping system in Cambisols of Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The experiment included three-factor randomized complete block design with three doses of each N, P, and K which was replicated three times. There was a remarkable change in soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N, P, and K contents of soil over a period of time with the application of different doses of NPK. Soil pH changed from 5.98 to 5.53, SOC increased from 11.7 to 16.8 gÂ·kgâˆ’1, total N decreased from 1264 to 1177 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1, available P2O5 declined from 214 to 63.6 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1, and available K2O decreased from 71.7 to 24.8 mgÂ·kgâˆ’1 with varying rates of NPK after four cropping seasons. Furthermore, partial, apparent, and net N, P, K balance were predominantly negative in all the fertilizer treatments, but the magnitude was lower under higher nutrient rates and positive partial N balance was noticed in higher N levels. The depletion of native P and K pools even at higher application rates was attributed to higher crop removal over time as compared to inputs. Therefore, continuous application of balanced fertilizers is crucial in maintaining the fertility of soil and productivity of crops.

TI  - Measurement of {Soil} {Water} {Content} with {Dielectric} {Dispersion} {Frequency
VL  - 78
SN  - NA
AB  - Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is an inexpensive and attractive methodology for repeated measurements of soil water content (Î¸). Although there are some known measurement limitations for dry soil and sand, a fixed-frequency method is commonly used with commercially available FDR probes. The purpose of our study was to determine if the soil dielectric spectrum could be used to measure changes in Î¸. A multifrequency FDR probe was constructed with a 6-mm diameter, and a soil dielectric spectrum was obtained. Using the dielectric spectrum, the dielectric dispersion frequency (fd) was determined. It was discovered that changes in fd were highly correlated with changes in Î¸, and a third-order polynomial equation (R2 = 0.96) was developed describing the relationship. The effectiveness of fd for Î¸ measurement was evaluated for three soils and a sand across a range of Î¸. The effects of soil temperature and soil salinity were also evaluated. Accurate measurements of Î¸ were obtained even in dry soil and sand. The root mean square error of the Î¸ estimated by the fd measurement was 0.021. The soil temperature and soil salinity had no measureable effects on Î¸ determination. The use of fd for Î¸ determination should be an effective and accurate methodology, especially when dry soils, soil temperature, and/or soil salinity could potentially cause problems with the Î¸ measurements.

TI  - Time-lapse monitoring of soil water content using electromagnetic conductivity imaging
VL  - 33
SN  - NA
AB  - Abstract The volumetric soil water content (Î¸) is fundamental to agriculture because its spatiotemporal variation in soil affects the growth of plants. Unfortunately, the universally accepted thermogravimetric method for estimating volumetric soil water content is very labour intensive and time-consuming for use in field-scale monitoring. Electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments have proven to be useful in mapping the spatiotemporal variation of Î¸. However, depth-specific variation in Î¸, which is important for irrigation management, has been little explored. The objective of this study was to develop a relationship between Î¸ and estimates of true electrical conductivity (Ïƒ) and to use this relationship to develop time-lapse images of soil Î¸ beneath a centre-pivot irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop in San Jacinto, California, USA. We first measured the bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa â€“ mS/m) using a DUALEM-421 over a period of 12 days after an irrigation event (i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12). We used EM4Soil to generate EM conductivity images (EMCIs). We used a physical model to estimate Î¸ from Ïƒ, accounting for soil tortuosity and pore water salinity, with a cross-validation RMSE of 0.04 cm3/cm3. Testing the scenario where no soil information is available, we used a three-parameter exponential model to relate Î¸ to Ïƒ and then to map Î¸ along the transect on different days. The results allowed us to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of Î¸ across the surveyed area, over the 12-day period. In this regard, we were able to map the soil close to field capacity (0.27 cm3/cm3) and approaching permanent wilting point (0.03 cm3/cm3). The time-lapse Î¸ monitoring approach, developed using EMCI, has implications for soil and water use and management and will potentially allow farmers and consultants to identify inefficiencies in water application rates and use. It can also be used as a research tool to potentially assist precision irrigation practices and to test the efficacy of different methods of irrigation in terms of water delivery and efficiency in water use in near real time.

TI  - A {Robust} {Calibration} {Method} for {Continental}-{Scale} {Soil} {Water} {Content} {Measurements
VL  - 17
SN  - NA
AB  - Core Ideas We present a semiautomated framework for large-scale calibration of capacitance soil moisture sensors. Soil-specific calibrations are needed for accurate moisture measurements in nearly all soil types. Transparent, traceable, and complete uncertainty estimates provided for entire approach. Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations across a continental-scale network in a production framework that incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer's nominal calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types. This resulted in negative (91\% of samples) and positive (5\% of samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (1Ïƒ) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer's nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to Â±0.017 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (Â±1Ïƒ). A logistic calibration function further reduced the mean RMSE to Â±0.016 cm3 cmâˆ’3 (Â±1Ïƒ) and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration applied by 18\% compared with the manufacturer's function. However, the uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (Â±0.022 cm3 cmâˆ’3), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content values increased to Â±0.028 cm3 cmâˆ’3 regardless of the calibration function used.

VL  - 76
SN  - NA
AB  - Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established electromagnetic technique used to measure soil water content. Time domain reflectometry sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable, and cheap measurements of soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in future field studies.

VL  - 48
SN  - NA
AB  - Scouting to determine soil water status throughout a golf course or large athletic field complex is quite time consuming and requires numerous observations to characterize variability across the site. The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of a ground-based remote sensing system to predict soil water content through partial least squares regression analysis of canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) maintained at 12.7 mm and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) maintained at 6.3 mm during 2002 and 2003 on a Coland silty clay loam. Volumetric soil water at a 5 cm depth was measured by time domain reflectometry and was collected in conjunction with spectral radiance measurements obtained using a fiber optic spectrometer. Volumetric soil water content was best predicted with partial least squares regression analysis of creeping bentgrass canopy reflectance data with a maximum r2 of 0.64 (P {\textless} 0.001) 1 d before development of drought stress symptoms. Similar results were observed for canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass plots, indicating that this technology and method of data analysis may be useful in the development of automated turfgrass irrigation management systems.
