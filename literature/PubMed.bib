	abstract = {On the way from the Internet of things (IoT) to the Internet of underground things (IoUT) the main challenge is antenna design. The enabling technologies  still rely on simple design and low cost, but the systems are more complex. The  LoRa-based system combined with a machine learning approach can be used for the  estimation of soil moisture by using signal strength data, but for the  improvement of the system performance we propose the optimization of the antenna  for underground use. The soil properties are frequency-dependent and varying in  time, which may cause variations in the signal wavelength and input impedance of  the antenna underground. Instead of using wideband antenna design or standard  helical antenna provided in LoRa module, which are typical in the IoUT research  community for communication links, we propose a narrow-band antenna design for  the application in soil moisture sensing. It is shown that the approach of simply  matching the antenna buried in dry sand can provide a substantial signal level  difference, ranging from approximately 10 dB (achieved by proof-of-concept  measurements) to as much as 40 dB (calculated by a full wave simulator) in  reflection coefficient when the moisture content is being increased by 20\%. This  can ensure more reliable radio sensing in novel sensorless technology where soil  moisture information is extracted from the signal strength of a transmitting  device.},

	abstract = {As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the interface  between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal  variations of SM is critical for numerous large-scale terrestrial studies.  Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large  scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are  almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale.  Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for  many years and significant progress has been made. In contrast to previous  reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and systematic review of using  optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis and  status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most  important and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal  information have been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal  remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface  reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing methods uses  the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface  temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation  processes and many approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal  infrared remotely sensed data can provide more valuable information for SM  estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are  compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture  estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested  solutions are proposed for future research.},

	abstract = {A new type of soil moisture sensor using spatial frequency domain transmissometry (SFDT) was evaluated. This sensor transmits and receives ultrawideband (1 to 6  GHz) radio waves between two separated antennas and measures the propagation  delay time in the soil related to the dielectric constant. This method is  expected to be less affected by air gaps between the probes and the soil, as well  as being less affected by soil electrical conductivity (EC), than typical  commercial sensors. The relationship between output and volumetric water content  (θ), and the effects of air gaps and EC were evaluated through experiments using  sand samples and the prototype SFDT sensor. The output of the SFDT sensor  increased linearly with θ and was not affected by even a high salt concentration  for irrigation water, such that the EC of the pore water was 9.2 dS·m(-1). The  SFDT sensor was almost unaffected by polyethylene tapes wrapped around the sensor  to simulate air gaps, whereas a commercially available capacitance sensor  significantly underestimated θ. Theoretical models of the SFDT sensor were also  developed for the calibration equation and the air gaps. The calculation results  agreed well with the experimental results, indicating that analytical approaches  are possible for the evaluation of the SFDT sensor.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by remote sensing, limited  to the top few centimeters ({\textless}5 cm). Researchers have attempted to estimate  root-zone soil moisture using multiple regression, data assimilation, and  data-driven methods. However, correlations between root-zone soil moisture and  its related variables, including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear,  which is difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The  artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear  relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil moisture  estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or spatial  correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model, known to  capture spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale sequential datasets with the  advantage of dealing with spatiotemporal sequence-forecasting problem, was used  in this study to estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based  variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation data, the  physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and spatiotemporal vertical  soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model training and verification. Then,  normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors  were selected as predictive variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that  the fitting coefficients (R(2)) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation  significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data  Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example, R(2)  increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests that a  combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool capable of predicting  spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy on a large  scale.},

To solve the above  problems, we propose a rapid SMC monitoring method for two-dimensional area based  on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). DAS demodulates the backward Rayleigh  scattering signal containing seismic wave sound velocity information from the  active seismic source. The folding ruler approximation is employed to calculate  the sound velocity of the soil, which is then inverted to determine the soil  moisture content. The experiment measured the soil within a two-dimensional area  formed by the seismic source and the acoustic sensing optical cable. The sensing  optical cable and the active seismic source are organized into a two-dimensional  area and the measurement range is 3 × 10 m with 33 points. The SMC ranges from  15\% to 40\%. The experiment shows that the absolute error between the measured  values obtained by DAS and the water cut meter is 7\%. This experiment verifies  the feasibility of using the Rayleigh scattering properties to invert SMC and  provides a new method for real-time monitoring of SMC in a large area.},

One of the main  drawbacks that hinder the use of precision agriculture is the cost of  technological immersion in the sector. For farmers, it is necessary to provide  low-cost and robust systems as well as reliability. Toward this end, this paper  presents a wireless sensor network of low-cost sensor nodes for soil moisture  that can help farmers optimize the irrigation processes in precision agriculture.  Each wireless node is composed of four soil moisture sensors that are able to  measure the moisture at different depths. Each sensor is composed of two coils  wound onto a plastic pipe. The sensor operation is based on mutual induction  between coils that allow monitoring the percentage of water content in the soil.  Several prototypes with different features have been tested. The prototype that  has offered better results has a winding ratio of 1:2 with 15 and 30 spires  working at 93 kHz. We also have developed a specific communication protocol to  improve the performance of the whole system. Finally, the wireless network was  tested, in a real, cultivated plot of citrus trees, in terms of coverage and  received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to check losses due to vegetation.},

A major challenge with current  approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band microwave  electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable retrievals. This  results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system  processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology from a single compact  instrument, where co-located broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to  sense multiple variables simultaneously or over a short duration. Rydberg atomic  sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be  dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for RF  band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted  signals such as from navigation and communication satellites to enable remote  sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth  system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic  systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use  signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote  sensing of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter of the climate system as it relates to plant transpiration and photosynthesis and impacts land-atmosphere interactions. Recent  developments have seen an increasing number of electromagnetic sensors available  commercially (EM) for soil volumetric water content (θ). Their use is constantly  expanding, and they are becoming increasingly used for agricultural, ecological,  and geotechnical applications and climate research, providing decision support  and high-resolution data for models and machine-learning algorithms. In this  study, a soil moisture sensor network consisting of 10 Sense Cap  capacitance-based sensors is evaluated. Analytical performance of the sensors was  determined based on laboratory and field measurements with dielectric  permittivity (ε) standards and soil media substrates. Sensor response  normalisation to standards of known ε was found to reduce intersensor variability  and provide robust estimates of θ in soil samples with known θ. Cross-comparison  with a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) instrument carried out in two soil media  demonstrates good agreement between the two probes throughout the tested range.  The data communication performance of the network was evaluated in terms of  packet drop rate at different ranges and sampling frequencies. It was noticed  that the drop rate increased with distance from the gateway, while sampling  frequency had no effect. Sources of errors associated with probe installation  were identified and recommendations are provided for sensor deployment. The  off-the-shelf all-in-one solution provided by Sense Cap is low cost, user  friendly and suitable for implementation at temporal and spatial scales once the  identified shortcomings are addressed. The evaluation presented aims to aid  stakeholders and users involved in soil and land management practices including  crop production, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and pollutants  transport.},

In this study, six soil nutrient indicators, including soil organic  matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen  (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) were measured in  five different aged stands of Chinese fir forests in subtropical China. A  structural equation model (SEM) was developed based on these soil nutrients  indicators in order to better evaluate the soil fertility index (SFI) in these  studied forests. The results show that soil nutrient contents changed with the  soil depth in different age groups. The SOM decreased in a specific order: over  mature {\textgreater} mature {\textgreater} near mature {\textgreater} middle {\textgreater} young stands. The TN content of the soil  gradually decreased with increased soil depth throughout all age groups. The SEM  indicated that the TN had the highest weight of 0.4154, while the TP had the  lowest weight at 0.1991 for estimating the SFI. The weights of other indicators  (AN, SOM, AP, and AK) ranged 0.2138−0.3855 in our study. The established SEM  satisfied the fitness reference values and was able to accurately describe the  forest soil nutrient status through the SFI. The overall SFI values were  significantly higher in over mature stands than in young-aged stands and in  topsoil than in deeper soil in all examined forests. Soil TN, AP, and AK were the  most important nutrient indicators to the evaluation of the SFI in the study  sites. The results confirmed that the SEM was suitable to estimate the weights of  the SFI and better describe the soil nutrient status in forests.

	abstract = {An effective soil moisture retrieval method for FY-3E (Fengyun-3E) GNOS-R (GNSS occultation sounder II-reflectometry) is developed in this paper. Here, the LAGRS  model, which is totally oriented for GNOS-R, is employed to estimate vegetation  and surface roughness effects on surface reflectivity. Since the LAGRS (land  surface GNSS reflection simulator) model is a space-borne GNSS-R (GNSS  reflectometry) simulator based on the microwave radiative transfer equation  model, the method presented in this paper takes more consideration on the  physical scattering properties for retrieval. Ancillary information from SMAP  (soil moisture active passive) such as the vegetation water content and the  roughness coefficient are investigated for the final algorithm's development. At  first, the SR (surface reflectivity) data calculated from GNOS-R is calculated  and then calibrated, and then the vegetation roughness factor is achieved and  used to eliminate the effects on both factors. After receiving the Fresnel  reflectivity, the corresponding soil moisture estimated from this method is  retrieved. The results demonstrate good consistency between soil moisture derived  from GNOS-R data and SMAP soil moisture, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9599  and a root mean square error of 0.0483 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in  providing soil moisture on a global scale and is based on the previously  developed physical LAGRS model. In this way, the great potential of GNOS-R for  soil moisture estimation is presented.},

	abstract = {Vadose zone soil moisture is often considered a pivotal intermediary water reservoir between surface and groundwater in semi-arid regions. Understanding its  dynamics in response to changes in meteorologic forcing patterns is essential to  enhance the climate resiliency of our ecological and agricultural system.  However, the inability to observe high-resolution vadose zone soil moisture  dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales hinders quantitative characterization.  Here, utilizing pre-existing fiber-optic cables as seismic sensors, we  demonstrate a fiber-optic seismic sensing principle to robustly capture vadose  zone soil moisture dynamics. Our observations in Ridgecrest, California reveal  sub-seasonal precipitation replenishments and a prolonged drought in the vadose  zone, consistent with a zero-dimensional hydrological model. Our results suggest  a significant water loss of 0.25 m/year through evapotranspiration at our field  side, validated by nearby eddy-covariance based measurements. Yet, detailed  discrepancies between our observations and modeling highlight the necessity for  complementary in-situ validations. Given the escalated regional drought risk  under climate change, our findings underscore the promise of fiber-optic seismic  sensing to facilitate water resource management in semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {Studies show that the performance of soil water content monitoring (SWCM) sensors is affected by soil physical and chemical properties. However, the effect of  organic matter on SWCM sensor responses remains less understood. Therefore, the  objectives of this study are to (i) assess the effect of organic matter on the  accuracy and precision of SWCM sensors using a commercially available soil water  content monitoring sensor; and (ii) account for the organic matter effect on the  sensor's accuracy. Sand columns with seven rates of oven-dried sawdust (2\%, 4\%,  6\%, 8\%, 10\%, 12\% and 18\% v/v, used as an organic matter amendment), thoroughly  mixed with quartz sand, and a control without sawdust were prepared by packing  quartz sand in two-liter glass containers. Sand was purposely chosen because of  the absence of any organic matter or salinity, and also because sand has a  relatively low cation exchange capacity that will not interfere with the  treatment effect of the current work. Sensor readings (raw counts) were monitored  at seven water content levels (0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, 0.24, and 0.30  cm³ cm(-3)) by uniformly adding the corresponding volumes of deionized water in  addition to the oven-dry one. Sensor readings were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05)  affected by the organic matter level and water content. Sensor readings were  strongly correlated with the organic matter level (R² = 0.92). In addition, the  default calibration equation underestimated the water content readings at the  lower water content range ({\textless}0.05 cm³ cm(-3)), while it overestimated the water  content at the higher water content range ({\textgreater}0.05 cm³ cm(-3)). A new polynomial  calibration equation that uses raw count and organic matter content as covariates  improved the accuracy of the sensor (RMSE = 0.01 cm³ cm(-3)). Overall, findings  of this study highlight the need to account for the effect of soil organic matter  content to improve the accuracy and precision of the tested sensor under  different soils and environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Continuous and accurate sensing of water content in soil is an essential and useful measure in the agriculture industry. Traditional sensors developed to  perform this task suffer from limited lifetime and also need to be calibrated  regularly. Further, maintenance, support, and deployment of these sensors in  remote environments provide additional challenges to the use of conventional soil  moisture sensors. In this paper, a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) based soil  moisture sensor is introduced. The ability of MPAs to absorb electromagnetic  signals with near 100\% efficiency facilitates the design of highly accurate and  low-profile radio frequency passive sensors. MPA based sensor can be fabricated  from highly durable materials and can therefore be made more resilient than  traditional sensors. High resolution sensing is achieved through the creation of  physical channels in the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity. The  proposed sensor does not require connection for both electromagnetic signals or  for adding a testing sample. Importantly, an external power supply is not needed,  making the MPA based sensor the perfect solution for remote and passive sensing  in modern agriculture. The proposed MPA based sensor has three absorption bands  due to the various resonance modes of the SIW cavity. By changing the soil  moisture level, the absorption peak shifts by 10 MHz, 23.3 MHz, and 60 MHz, which  is correlated with the water content percentage at the first, second and third  absorption bands, respectively. Finally, a [Formula: see text] cell array with a  total size of [Formula: see text] has been fabricated and tested. A strong  correlation between measurement and simulation results validates the design  procedure.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere is one of the major environmental parameters which plays an important role in  hydrological applications. In this article, the SM measured by Soil Moisture  Active Passive (SMAP) is downscaled from 3- to 1-km spatial resolution. The main  purpose is to evaluate the performance of two different downscaling methods over  a variety of climatic conditions and land cover types. These two methods, based  on regression and artificial neural network (ANN), are used for enabling us to  cross-validate and reliably interpret the obtained results since the number of  ground measurements is not sufficient for accuracy assessment. These methods are  applied over four different case studies; one is located in the USA, i.e., state  of Utah (semi-arid), and the remaining three are located in Iran, i.e., Fars  (arid and semi-arid), Yazd (hyper-arid), and Golestan (humid). In both methods,  different combinations of input features correlated with SM including land  surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),  brightness temperatures in horizontal and vertical polarizations (T(BH) and  T(BV)), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and digital elevation model (DEM) are used. It  is found that the DEM does not add extra information in downscaling. The reason  is due to high correlation between topography and LST. Moreover, SWIR is most  likely able to model only large-scale variations of SM. The downscaled SM  products are then compared to 1-km resolution SMAP SM extracted from Sentinel-1  for the study areas in Iran and in situ measurements in Utah. Both methods  produce results which are considerably consistent except that the regression  method adds more spatial details in the downscaled SM. The achievements  illustrate that the performance of both downscaling methods is higher in areas  with more homogeneous climatic conditions, i.e., Yazd and Golestan. The best  evaluation metrics including correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error  (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for Yazd and Golestan are R =  0.89, RMSE = 0.025 m(3)/m(3), and MAPE = 21.13\% and R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.044  m(3)/m(3), and MAPE = 21.95\%, respectively. Moreover, large model biases are  associated with dense vegetated areas and high altitudes. The best downscaling  accuracy in both methods over all study areas belongs to bare soil and flat  regions.},

	abstract = {There is a gap between lab experiments where resistivity-soil moisture relations are generally very good and field studies in complex environmental settings where  relations are always less good and complicated by many factors. An experiment was  designed where environmental settings are more controlled, the best outside  laboratory, to assess the transferability from lab to outdoor. A field experiment  was carried out to evaluate the use of electric resistivity tomography (ERT) for  monitoring soil moisture dynamics over a period of 67 days. A homogeneous site in  the central part of The Netherlands was selected consisting of grass pasture on  an aeolian sand soil profile. ERT values were correlated to gravimetric soil  moisture samples for five depths at three different dates. Correlations ranged  from 0.43 to 0.73 and were best for a soil depth of 90 cm. Resistivity patterns  over time (time-lapse ERT) were analyzed and related to rainfall events where  rainfall infiltration patterns could be identified. Duplicate ERT measurements  showed that the noise level of the instrument and measurements is low and  generally below 3\% for the soil profile below the mixed layer but above the  groundwater. Although the majority of the measured resistivity patterns could be  well explained, some artefacts and dynamics were more difficult to clarify, even  so in this homogeneous field situation. The presence of an oak tree with its root  structure and a ditch with surface water with higher conductivity may have an  impact on the resistivity pattern in the soil profile and over time. We conclude  that ERT allows for detailed spatial measurement of local soil moisture dynamics  resulting from precipitation although field experiments do not yield accuracies  similar to laboratory experiments. ERT approaches are suitable for detailed  spatial analyses where probe or sample-based methods are limited in reach or  repeatability.},

Nutrients, their presence, concentration, and effectiveness, are key  components in data-driven agriculture. Assessing macro and micro-nutrients, as  well as factors such as water and pH, helps determine soil fertility, which is  vital for supporting healthy plant growth and high crop yields. Insufficient soil  nutrient assessment during continuous cropping can threaten long-term  agricultural viability. Soil nutrients need to be measured and replenished after  each harvest for optimal yield. However, existing soil testing procedures are  expensive and time-consuming. The proposed research aims to assess soil nutrient  levels, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, to provide critical  information and guidance on restoring optimal soil fertility. In this research, a  novel chip-level colorimeter is fabricated to detect the N and P elements of soil  onto a handheld colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Chemical reaction with soil  solution generates color in the presence of nutrients, which are then  quantitatively measured using sensors. The test samples are collected from  various farmlands, and the results are validated with laboratory analysis of  samples using spectrophotometers used in laboratories. ANOVA test has been  performed in which F value {\textgreater} 1 in our study indicates statistically significant  differences between the group means. The alternate hypothesis, which proposes the  presence of significant differences between the groups, is supported by the data.

Herein, this work presents a high-performance  multi-parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VO(X) )-doped laser-induced  graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NO(X) ) and  temperature. The highly porous 3D VO(X) -doped LIG foam composite is readily  obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V(5) S(8) )-doped block copolymer  and phenolic resin self-assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the  LIG/VO(X) interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NO(X) and an  ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room  temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast  response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the  sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10-110 °C.  The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for  temperature sensing without being affected by NO(X) . The unencapsulated sensor  operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and  temperature variations for accurate NO(X) measurements.

In this study, multispectral and  thermal-infrared remote-sensing data, along with soil-moisture-content (SMC)  samples (0{\textasciitilde}20 cm, 20{\textasciitilde}40 cm, and 40{\textasciitilde}60 cm soil layers), were collected during the  flowering stage of soybean. Data sources included vegetation indices, texture  features, texture indices, and thermal-infrared vegetation indices. Spectral  parameters with a significant correlation level (p {\textless} 0.01) were selected and  input into the model as single- and fuse-input variables. Three machine learning  methods, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and Genetic  Algorithm-optimized Backpropagation Neural Network (GA-BP), were utilized to  construct prediction models for soybean SMC based on the fusion of UAV  multispectral and thermal-infrared remote-sensing information. The results  indicated that among the single-input variables, the vegetation indices (VIs)  derived from multispectral sensors had the optimal accuracy for monitoring SMC in  different soil layers under soybean cultivation. The prediction accuracy was the  lowest when using single-texture information, while the combination of texture  feature values into new texture indices significantly improved the performance of  estimating SMC. The fusion of vegetation indices (VIs), texture indices (TIs),  and thermal-infrared vegetation indices (TVIs) provided a better prediction of  soybean SMC. The optimal prediction model for SMC in different soil layers under  soybean cultivation was constructed based on the input combination of VIs + TIs +  TVIs, and XGBoost was identified as the preferred method for soybean SMC  monitoring and modeling, with its R(2) = 0.780, RMSE = 0.437\%, and MRE = 1.667\%  in predicting 0{\textasciitilde}20 cm SMC. In summary, the fusion of UAV multispectral and  thermal-infrared remote-sensing information has good application value in  predicting SMC in different soil layers under soybean cultivation.

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied in many aspects. To address the problem of measuring water content in soil, this paper proposes a method to  measure soil water content based on the PCA. We used PCA to reduce the dimension  of the data and processed the soil amplitude ratio frequency response spectra.  First, we designed the measuring device and measured the soil amplitude ratio  frequency response data of different water content, then we used the PCA to  extract features from the frequency response spectra of different water contents,  established a relationship model of soil water content, and finally, we solved  the model, the maximum error between the calculation results and the actual water  content was no more than 0.85\%. Subsequently, we carried out experimental  verification, and we measured six kinds of soil with known water content by this  method. The experimental results showed that the maximum error did not exceed  1.16\%, and the average error was 0.71\%. Thus, the proposed method can provide a  useful way of measuring soil water content.},

	abstract = {Actively heated fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (aFO-DTS) measures soil moisture content at sub-meter intervals across kilometres of fiber-optic  cable. The technology has great potential for environmental monitoring but  calibration at field scales with variable soil conditions is challenging. To  better understand and quantify the errors associated with aFO-DTS soil moisture  measurements, we use a parametric numerical modeling approach to evaluate  different error factors for uniform soil. A thermo-hydrogeologic, unsaturated  numerical model is used to simulate a 0.01 m by 0.01 m two-dimensional domain,  including soil and a fiber-optic cable. Results from the model are compared to  soil moisture values calculated using the commonly used T(cum) calibration method  for aFO-DTS. The model is found to have high accuracy between measured and  observed saturations for static hydrologic conditions but shows discrepancies for  more realistic settings with active recharge. We evaluate the performance of  aFO-DTS soil moisture calculations for various scenarios, including varying  recharge duration and heterogeneous soils. The aFO-DTS accuracy decreases as the  variability in soil properties and intensity of recharge events increases.  Further, we show that the burial of the fiber-optic cable within soil may  adversely affect calculated results. The results demonstrate the need for careful  selection of calibration data for this emerging method of measuring soil moisture  content.},

The soil moisture is measured as the volumetric water content using a  short-range off-the-shelf radar sensor operating at 3-10 GHz. The radar captures  the reflected signals that are post processed to determine the soil moisture  which is mapped to the input features extracted from the reflected signals for  the training of the machine learning models. In addition, the results are  compared and analyzed with a contact-based Vernier soil sensor. Different machine  learning models trained using neural network, support vector machine, linear  regression and k-nearest neighbor are evaluated and presented in this work. The  efficiency of the model is computed using root mean square error, co-efficient of  determination and mean absolute error. The RMSE and MAE values of KNN, SVM and  Linear Regression are 11.51 and 9.27, 15.20 and 12.74, 3.94 and 3.54,  respectively.

Proper  estimation of moisture content not only allows for proper yields but can also  contribute to ecologically appropriate use of fresh water, of which the world's  resources are limited. It is important, for example, that the moisture content in  the root area of plants is optimal for their growth, while over-watering can  result in losses in the form of water, which seeps below the root layer and is  lost. The novel, inexpensive electronic meter for measuring soil moisture is  presented in the article. The meter, based on a capacitive method, uses an  optimization algorithm to calculate soil electrical permeability and a simplified  new formula between soil electrical permeability and volumetric moisture content.  Moreover, by using two high-frequency signals for measurements, it is possible  not only to estimate moisture content but also soil conductivity. Both readings  obtained from the meter not only allow for rational management of crop  optimization for economic reasons but are also important for environmental  protection. In addition, the inexpensive meter, based on the principle of  operation presented, can be made as an IoT module, which allows for its wide  application.},

A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the applicability of CRNS  for monitoring soil moisture in winter wheat farmland of the North China Plain.

The  results showed that the CRNS detection radius obtained by URANOS simulation was  127-139 m, and that the weight distribution showed good agreement with the  theoretical value.

To do this, we used structural  equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent  "generalized fertility," F(G) , of a soil using four indicator variables: the  relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum,  and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F(G) in this study were the supply  rates of NO(3)(-) , P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three  physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was  calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and  independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the  natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and  the full SEM fit the data well. The F(G) values predicted 51\% of the variance in  NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the  actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland  soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of  soil fertility are clearly separated.},

As this approach receives more attention, it is worth  analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve subsurface soil moisture (SM) by  leveraging communication and navigation satellite transmitters. In this research,  the CRLB is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on the  best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study  investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and incidence angle  measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric profile. The results also  detail the effects of variable SM conditions on the capability of SoOp-R systems  to predict subsurface SM. The most prevalent observation is the importance of  using at least two frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM  estimates. If at least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is  retrievable within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as  the number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30 cm, it  is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy is  achievable with as few as 2 dual-frequency-based SoOp-R measurements. For this  depth, increasing number of measurements provided by polarization and incidence  angle allow for sensing of increasingly wet SM profile structures. This study,  overall, details a methodology by which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to  achieve a desired CRLB using a trade-off study between the available measurements  and SM profile.},

We  have extracted nine different features from Sentinel-1 (dual-polarised radar  backscatter), Sentinel-2 (red and near-infrared bands), and Shuttle Radar  Topographic Mission (digital elevation model) satellite products by leveraging  the linear data fusion and graphical indicators. We performed a feature  importance analysis by using the regression ensemble tree approach and also  feature sensitivity to evaluate the impact of each feature on the response  variable. For training and assessing the model performance, we conducted two  field campaigns on the Kosi Fan in December 11-19, 2019 and March 01-06, 2022. We  used a calibrated TDR probe to measure surface soil moisture at 224 different  locations distributed throughout the fan surface. We used input features to  train, validate, and test the performance of the feed-forward ANN model in a  60:10:30 ratio, respectively. We compared the performance of ANN model with ten  different machine learning algorithms [i.e., Generalised Regression Neural  Network (GRNN), Radial Basis Network (RBN), Exact RBN (ERBN), Gaussian Process  Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Boosting  Ensemble Learning (Boosting EL), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Binary Decision  Tree (BDT), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)]. We observed that the ANN  model accurately predicts the soil moisture and outperforms all the benchmark  algorithms with correlation coefficient (R = 0.80), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE  = 0.040 [Formula: see text]), and bias = 0.004 [Formula: see text].

In our  study, the AHFO method yielded estimates of the soil moisture (θ) profile with a  spatial resolution of {\textasciitilde}6.5 mm and with an error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3). The  numerical model resulted in a slightly different θ profile than that measured,  where the largest differences occurred at the soil surface. Sensitivity and  uncertainty analyses highlighted that a better precision is required when  determining the soil hydraulic parameters. To improve the proposed method, the  soil heat-vapor-water dynamics should be included and the assumption that the  evaporation front remains at the soil surface must be relaxed. Additionally, if  the AHFO calibration curve is enhanced, the errors of the estimated θ profile can  be reduced and thus, successful estimation of the evaporation rates for a wider  range of soil textures can be achieved. The spatial scales measured are an  important advantage of the proposed method that should be further explored to  improve the analysis presented here.},

To understand the impacts of aerosols on climate, human health, and  the ecosystem we must need to understand the variability of aerosols and their  optical properties. Therefore, we used Aqua-MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depth  (AOD) (550 nm) and Angstrom exponent (AE) (440/870) data to analyze the  Spatio-temporal seasonal variability of aerosols and their relationship with  different meteorological parameters over Pakistan from 2002 to 2021. High ({\textgreater}0.5)  AOD values were observed during the summer season and low ({\textless}0.8) in the spring  season. AE values were observed to be high ({\textgreater}1) in the northern regions of  Pakistan indicating the dominance of fine mode particles during the winter  season. Moreover, AOD showed a positive correlation with Relative Humidity (RH),  Evapotranspiration, Wind speed (WS), and Temperature. On the other hand, it  showed a negative correlation with Soil moisture (SM), Normalized difference  vegetation index (NDVI), and precipitation over Pakistan. Therefore, considering  the outcomes of this study will help policymakers to understand the  spatiotemporal variability of aerosols and their seasonal correlation with  different meteorological parameters.},

The  objective of this study is to develop a low-cost soil moisture sensor using  capacitors on a film substrate and a capacitive touch integrated circuit. The  performance of the sensor was evaluated in two field experiments: a grape field  and a mizuna greenhouse field. The developed sensor captured dynamic changes in  soil moisture at 10, 20, and 30 cm depth, with a period of 10-14 days required  after sensor installation for the contact between capacitors and soil to settle  down. The measured soil moisture showed the influence of individual sensor  differences, and the influence masked minor differences of less than 0.05  m³·m(-3) in the soil moisture at different locations. However, the developed  sensor could detect large differences of more than 0.05 m³·m(-3), as well as the  different magnitude of changes, in soil moisture. The price of the developed  sensor was reduced to 300 U.S. dollars and can be reduced even more by further  improvements suggested in this study and by mass production. Therefore, the  developed sensor will be made more affordable to farmers as it requires low  financial investment, and it can be utilized for decision-making in irrigation.},

The objectives of this study were to assess (i) the degradation of soil  moisture sensor component materials and (ii) the effects of material degradation  on maize (Zea Mays L.) growth and development. This study was conducted in a  greenhouse at Colorado State University, Colorado, USA, by planting maize seeds  in pots filled with three growing media (field soil, silica sand, and Promix  commercial potting media). The degradation rate of five candidate sensor  materials (three blends of beeswax and soy wax, balsa wood, and PHBV  (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate))) was assessed by harvesting sensor  materials at four maize growth stages (30, 60, 90, and 120 days after  transplanting). All materials under consideration showed stability in terms of  mass and dimension except PHBV. PHBV was degraded entirely within 30 days in soil  and Promix, and within 60 days in sand. Balsa wood did now show any significant  reduction in mass and dimensions in all growth media. Similarly, there was no  significant mass loss across wax blends (p = 0.05) at any growth stage, with a  few exceptions. Among the wax blends, 3:1 (beeswax:soy wax) was the most stable  blend in terms of mass and dimension with no surface cracks, making it a suitable  encapsulant for soil sensor. All materials under consideration did not have any  significant effect on maize growth (dry biomass, green biomass, and height) as  compared to control plants. These results indicated that 3:1 beeswax:soy wax  blend, PHBV, and balsa wood could be suitable candidates for various components  of biodegradable soil moisture sensors.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor technology advancements have made soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) a vital component of precision agriculture. However, the  humidity nodes in SMWSNs have a weak ability in information collection, storage,  calculation, etc. Hence, it is essential to reasonably pursue task allocation for  SMWSNs to improve the network benefits of SMWSNs. However, the task allocation of  SMWSNs is an NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial)-hard issue, and its complexity  becomes even higher when constraints such as limited computing capabilities and  power are taken into consideration. In this paper, a novel differential evolution  adaptive elite butterfly optimization algorithm (DEAEBOA) is proposed. DEAEBOA  has significantly improved the task allocation efficiency of SMWSNs, effectively  avoided plan stagnation, and greatly accelerated the convergence speed. In the  meantime, a new adaptive operator was designed, which signally ameliorates the  accuracy and performance of the algorithm. In addition, a new elite operator and  differential evolution strategy are put forward to markedly enhance the global  search ability, which can availably avoid local optimization. Simulation  experiments were carried out by comparing DEAEBOA with the butterfly optimization  algorithm (BOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and  beluga whale optimization (BWO). The simulation results show that DEAEBOA  significantly improved the task allocation efficiency, and compared with BOA,  PSO, GA, and BWO the network benefit rate increased by 11.86\%, 5.46\%, 8.98\%, and  12.18\% respectively.},

For the above reason, a prototype device was  developed including a low-cost microcontroller and suitable adaptation circuits  for the aforementioned sensor. Six characteristic porous media were examined in a  θ range from air drying to saturation, while four different solutions of  increasing Electrical Conductivity (EC(w)) from 0.28 dS/m to approximately 10  dS/m were used in four of these porous media. It was found that TEROS 12 apparent  dielectric permittivity (ε(a)) readings were lower than that of Topp's  permittivity-water content relationship, especially at higher soil water content  values in the coarse porous bodies. The differences are observed in sand (S),  sandy loam (SL) and loam (L), at this order. The results suggested that the  relationship between experimentally measured soil water content (θ(m)) and  ε(a)(0.5) was strongly linear (0.869 {\textless} R(2) {\textless} 0.989), but the linearity of the  relation θ(m)-ε(a)(0.5) decreases with the increase in bulk EC (σ(b)) of the  soil. The most accurate results were provided by the multipoint calibration  method (CAL), as evaluated with the root mean square error (RMSE). Also, it was  found that ε(a) degrades substantially at values of σ(b) less than 2.5 dS/m while  ε(a) returns to near 80 at higher values. Regarding the relation ε(a)-σ(b), it  seems that it is strongly linear and that its slope depends on the pore water  electrical conductivity (σ(p)) and the soil type.},

Nevertheless, the persisting challenge is  to design and construct stable materials with the requisite sensitivity,  selectivity, and high performance. Here, we report the introduction of porous  metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the receptor layer, in capacitive sensors to  efficiently sense moisture in two types of soil. Namely, our study unveiled that  Cr-soc-MOF-1 offers the best sensitivity (≈24,000 pF) among the other tested MOFs  for any given range of soil-moisture content, outperforming several well-known  oxide materials. The corresponding increase in the sensitivities for tested MOFs  at 500 Hz are ≈450, ≈200, and ≈30\% for Cr-soc-MOF-1, Al-ABTC-soc-MOF, and  Zr-fum-fcu-MOF, respectively. Markedly, Cr-soc-MOF-1, with its well-known water  capacity, manifests an excellent sensitivity of ≈450\% in clayey soil, and the  analogous response time was 500 s. The noted unique sensing properties of  Cr-soc-MOF-1 unveils the great potential of MOFs for soil-moisture sensing  application.},

The results showed that  the soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly increased from 2008 to  2018, while available nitrogen (AN) significantly decreased from 2008 to 2018.  The semi-variance revealed that except available phosphorus (AP), the spatial  dependencies of soil properties increased from 2008 to 2018.

The sensor  consists of only simple architectural components, and as such they are  inexpensive and lightweight, making it suitable for on-site analysis. The sensing  mechanism is proved to be identical to a battery type discharge reaction wherein  polyaniline redox energy changes from the conducting to the nonconducting state  with a resulting voltage shift in the presence of soil moisture. Unlike the state  of the art soil moisture sensors, a signal derived from the proposed moisture  sensor is probe size independent, as it is potentiometric in nature and, hence,  can be fabricated in any shape or size and can provide a consistent output signal  under the strong aberration conditions often encountered in soil moisture  analysis. The sensor is regenerable by treating with 1 M HCl and can be used for  multiple analysis with little read out hysteresis. Further, a portable sensor is  fabricated which can provide warning signals to the end user when the moisture  levels in the soil go below critically low levels, thereby functioning as a smart  device. As the sensor is inexpensive, portable, and potentiometric, it opens up  avenues for developing effective and energy efficient irrigation strategies,  understanding the heat and water transfer at the atmosphere-land interface,  understanding soil mechanics, forecasting the risk of natural calamities, and so  on.},

The soil moisture control  strategy was designed to regulate wastewater disposal timing according to drain  field conditions to prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental  hazard. CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore  difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control system  successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain field conditions,  saturated field conditions during the dormant season presented practical  application challenges. The paired field experiment and simulation model  demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated in the vicinity of drip  emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in maintaining adequate COD and  NH(4)(+)-N removal efficiencies, the efficient removal of biodegradable COD  itself by soil biofilm limits denitrification of formed NO(3)(-)-N . Furthermore,  stimulated soil biofilm growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters,  which was discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of  which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system performance in  sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of soil moisture sensors  within the drain field can have pronounced impacts on system hydraulic  performance, depending on the soil permeability. Overall, the soil moisture  control strategy tested is shown as a viable supplemental technology to promote  the environmental sustainability of rural sanitation systems.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture has been considered a key variable in governing the terrestrial ecosystem. However, it is challenging to preserve indigenous soil characteristics  using conventional soil moisture monitoring methods that require maximum soil  contacts. To overcome this issue, we developed a non-destructive method of  evaluating soil moisture using a contactless ultrasonic system. This system was  designed to measure leaky Rayleigh waves at the air-soil joint-half space. The  influences of soil moisture on leaky Rayleigh waves were explored under sand,  silt, and clay in a controlled experimental design. Our results showed that there  were strong relationships between the energy and amplitude of leaky Rayleigh  waves and soil moisture for all three soil cases. These results can be explained  by reduced soil strengths during evaporation processes for coarse soil particles  as opposed to fine soil particles. To evaluate soil moisture based on the dynamic  parameters and wave properties obtained from the observed leaky Rayleigh waves,  we used the random forest model. The accuracy of predicted soil moisture was  exceptional for test data sets under all soil types (R2 ≥ 0.98, RMSE ≤ 0.0089 m3  m-3). That is, our study demonstrated that the leaky Rayleigh waves had great  potential to continuously assess soil moisture variations without soil  disturbances.},

The distributed temperature  sensing (DTS) technology, based on a dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP), is a novel  approach to realizing large-scale soil moisture estimation. However, the  application of the method is limited by the complex optical cable layout,  calculation algorithm, and lack of standardized heating strategy. In this paper,  an improved DPHP-DTS method considering the soil bulk density was proposed. The  measurement accuracy of the DPHP-DTS method under different heating strategies  was studied in laboratory experiments, and its long-term stability in regard to  the monitoring of soil moisture during natural evaporation in different soils was  tested. The results show that the improved DPHP-DTS method can accurately measure  the soil moisture, and the fitting algorithm can reduce the error caused by the  accuracy of the DTS temperature measurement under the low-power heating strategy.  Its measurement accuracy increases with the increase in the heating strength and  duration. In addition, the improved DPHP-DTS method can describe soil evaporation  in both sand and loess with good reliability and stability.},

This  research focused on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture,  vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness  Index (TVDI) under a biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan  paired watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz  province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing techniques, the  soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured and statistically analyzed  in the three aspects of both TW and CW during a growth period from May to October  2017. The results indicated that soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land  surface temperature values in the paired watershed were significantly different  at the 0.01 level during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the  TW had an inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly  impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83, while  this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation cover and soil  moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects had the highest TVDI and  land surface temperature compared to the northern and eastern aspects of both  watersheds. However, the increased vegetation cover as a biological watershed  management activity in the steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an  increased soil moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil  dryness. As a result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls  on the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and  semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity can  effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the watersheds. In  particular, the vegetation cover protection and biological practices can be  considered as practical solutions in the rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds  in arid and semiarid environments.},

Most related studies, however, focus on a local scale, which  prevents a clear understanding of the spatial distribution of CSAs for soil P  loss at regional scale. Moreover, the continual, long-term variation in CSAs was  scarcely reported. It is impossible to identify the factors driving the variation  in CSAs, or to collect land surface information essential for CSAs detection, by  merely using the conventional methodologies at regional scale. This study  proposes a new regional-scale approach, based on three satellite sensors (ASTER,  TM/ETM and MODIS), that were implemented successfully to detect CSAs at regional  scale over 15years (2000-2014). The approach incorporated five factors  (precipitation, slope, soil erosion, land use, soil total phosphorus) that drive  soil P loss from CSAs. Results show that the average area of critical phosphorus  source areas (CPSAs) was 15,056km(2) over the 15-year period, and it occupied  13.8\% of the total area, with a range varying from 1.2\% to 23.0\%, in a  representative, intensive agricultural area of China. In contrast to previous  studies, we found that the locations of CSAs with P loss are spatially variable,  and are more dispersed in their distribution over the long term. We also found  that precipitation acts as a key driving factor in the variation of CSAs at  regional scale. The regional-scale method can provide scientific guidance for  managing soil phosphorus loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of  water bodies at regional scale, and shows great potential for exploring factors  that drive the variation in CSAs at global scale.},

Ancestral  Pueblo communities of the central Mesa Verde region became increasingly reliant  on maize agriculture for their subsistence needs by AD 900. Prehistoric  agriculturalists (e.g., Ancestral Pueblo farmers) were dependent on having  sufficient soil moisture for successful plant growth. To better understand the  quality of farmland in terms of soil moisture, this study develops a static  geospatial soil moisture model, the Soil Moisture Proxy Model, which uses soil  and topographic variables to estimate soil moisture potential across a watershed.  The model is applied to the semi-arid region of the Goodman watershed in the  central Mesa Verde region of southwestern Colorado. We evaluate the model by  comparing the Goodman watershed output to two other watersheds and to soil  moisture sensor values. The simple framework can be used in other regions of the  world, where water is also an important limiting factor for farming. The general  outcome of this research is an improved understanding of potential farmland and  human-environmental relationships across the local landscape.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important factor that affects agricultural development in arid regions. Compared with the space-borne remote sensing system,  the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used because of its stronger  controllability and higher resolution. It also provides a more convenient method  for monitoring SMC than normal measurement methods that includes field sampling  and oven-drying techniques. However, research based on UAV hyperspectral data has  not yet formed a standard procedure in arid regions. Therefore, a universal  processing scheme is required. We hypothesized that combining pretreatments of  UAV hyperspectral imagery under optimal indices and a set of field observations  within a machine learning framework will yield a highly accurate estimate of SMC.  Optimal 2D spectral indices act as indispensable variables and allow us to  characterize a model's SMC performance and spatial distribution. For this  purpose, we used hyperspectral imagery and a total of 70 topsoil samples (0-10  cm) from the farmland (2.5 × 10(4) m(2)) of Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur  AutonomousRegion, China. The random forest (RF) method and extreme learning  machine (ELM) were used to estimate the SMC using six methods of pretreatments  combined with four optimal spectral indices. The validation accuracy of the  estimated method clearly increased compared with that of linear models. The  combination of pretreatments and indices by our assessment effectively eliminated  the interference and the noises. Comparing two machine learning algorithms showed  that the RF models were superior to the ELM models, and the best model was PIR (R  (2) (val) = 0.907, RMSEP = 1.477, and RPD = 3.396). The SMC map predicted via the  best scheme was highly similar to the SMC map measured. We conclude that  combining preprocessed spectral indices and machine learning algorithms allows  estimation of SMC with high accuracy (R (2) (val) = 0.907) via UAV hyperspectral  imagery on a regional scale. Ultimately, our program might improve management and  conservation strategies for agroecosystem systems in arid regions.},

In this work, NIR diffuse  reflectance spectroscopy was used to correct the fluorescence spectra of PAHs in  order to reduce the effect of the soil moisture. To establish the correction  method, eight soil samples with different moisture contents and a given  phenanthrene concentration (8 mg/g) were prepared. The fluorescence and NIR  diffuse reflectance spectra were collected for of all samples. It was found that  the fluorescence spectra of the soil samples that vary with the moisture content  together with the NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were considered for the  correction of the fluorescence intensity of phenanthrene related to the moisture  content. The results showed that the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at  384 nm to the NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum absorbance at 5184 cm(-1) can be  used as a correction factor to reduce the effect of the soil moisture on the  fluorescence intensity of phenanthrene in the soil. The validity of the  correction method was verified by the quantitative analysis of PAHs with  different concentrations and soil moisture contents. The results showed better  linearity between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PAHs after  the correction (with a correlation coefficient R of 0.99) than before the  correction (with R of 0.86). The relative prediction errors for three unknown  samples decreased from 19\%, 51\% and 40\% before the correction to 5\%, 13\% and  0.44\% after the correction, respectively, indicating the feasibility of the  detection of PAHs in the soil by the combination of fluorescence and NIR diffuse  reflectance spectroscopy.},

This study is aimed at the  evaluation of OPTRAM for field scale precision agriculture applications using  ultrahigh spatial resolution optical observations obtained with one of the  world's largest field robotic phenotyping scanners located in Maricopa, Arizona.  We replaced NDVI with the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which has been  shown to be more accurate for cropped agricultural fields that transition from  bare soil to dense vegetation cover. The OPTRAM was parameterized based on the  trapezoidal geometry of the pixel distribution within the TR(SWIR)-SAVI space,  from which wet- and dry-edge parameters were determined. The accuracy of the  resultant SM estimates is evaluated based on a comparison with ground reference  measurements obtained with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors deployed to  monitor surface, near-surface and root zone SM. The obtained results indicate an  SM estimation error between 0.045 and 0.057 cm(3) cm(-3) for the near-surface and  root zone, respectively. The high resolution SM maps clearly capture the spatial  SM variability at the sensor locations.

In response, we conducted a robust three-year field validation study at a  well-instrumented agricultural site in Nebraska, United States. The study  involved 27 gravimetric water content sampling campaigns in maize and soybean and  (40)K specific activity (Bq kg(-1)) measurements from a stationary GRS sensor.  Our analysis showed that the current method for biomass water content correction  is appropriate for our maize and soybean field but that the ratio of soil mass  attenuation to water mass attenuation used in the theoretical equation must be  adjusted to satisfactorily describe the field data. We propose a calibration  equation with two free parameters: the theoretical (40)K intensity in dry soil  and a, which creates an "effective" mass attenuation ratio.

Restoring vegetation can  effectively reduce soil erosion, thereby reducing the loss of nitrogen and  phosphorus. In the Loess Plateau, owing to the shortage of water resources and  the adverse effects of over-revegetation, the restoration of vegetation in large  areas is limited. To efficiently prevent the loss of soil nutrients and reduce  non-point source pollution, vegetation patterns need to be reasonably restored.  However, it is currently not clear as to how this can be achieved. Different  slope-gully systems were established in this study, including pattern A (no  vegetation), pattern B (up-slope vegetation), pattern C (middle-slope  vegetation), and pattern D (down-slope vegetation). Then, the effects of  vegetation patterns on soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil total phosphorus (TP)  losses associated with runoff and sediment processes was quantitatively evaluated  through the simulated rainfall. The results showed that (1) vegetation pattern  markedly affected the yields of runoff, sediment, soil nitrogen, and soil  phosphorus, resulting in the following order: pattern A {\textgreater} pattern B {\textgreater} pattern  C {\textgreater} pattern D. (2) The correlation between TN and runoff was higher than that  between TN and sediment; conversely, TP was more strongly correlated with  sediment than with runoff. (3) Nitrogen loss with runoff was the main source of  TN (58.76-90.74\%), while phosphorus loss with sediment was the main source of TP  (48.51-89.30\%). Compared with other vegetation patterns, the down-slope can more  effectively reduce the yields of runoff and sediment, thereby reducing the loss  of TN and TP. Therefore, it was suggested that the lower part of the slope should  be considered when revegetating.},

However, dielectric readings of capacitance sensors  operating at low frequencies are normally biased by high soil electrical  conductivity. A procedure to calibrate capacitance-resistance probes in saline  conditions was implemented in contrasting soils. A low-cost  capacitance-resistance probe (ECH2O-5TE, 70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA,  USA) was used in five soils at four water contents (i.e., from dry conditions to  saturation) and four salinity levels of the wetting solution (0, 5, 10, and 15 dS  · m-1). θ was accurately predicted as a function of the dielectric constant,  apparent electrical conductivity (EC(a)), texture and organic carbon content,  even in high salinity conditions. Four models to estimate pore-water electrical  conductivity were tested and a set of empirical predicting functions were  identified to estimate the model parameters based on easily available soil  properties (e.g., texture, soil organic matter). The four models were  reformulated to estimate EC(p) as a function of EC(a), dielectric readings, and  soil characteristics, improving their performances with respect to the original  model formulation. Low-cost capacitance-resistance probes, if properly  calibrated, can be effectively used to monitor water and solute dynamics in  saline soils.},

The decomposition rules of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as  well as the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil microbial biomass carbon  (MBC) and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in straw returned to the field for  15, 35, 55, 75, 95, 145 and 365 days were analyzed. The results showed that in  the short term, the decomposition of straw was better in both the rotray tillage  and deep loosening + deep rotary modes than in the no-tillage mode, and the  addition of decomposer significantly promoted the decomposition of straw and the  release of carbon from straw, among them, the RT + S treatment had the highest  straw decomposition proportion and carbon release proportion in all sampling  periods. After a one year experimental cycle, the RT + S treatment showed the  highest proportion of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin decomposition with  35.49\%, 84.23\% and 85.50\%, respectively, and soil SOC, MBC and DOC contents were  also higher than the other treatments with an increase of 2.30 g kg(-1),  14.22 mg kg(-1) and 25.10 mg kg(-1), respectively, compared to the  pre-experimental soil. Our results show that in the short term, to accelerate the  decomposition rate of returned straw and increase the content of various forms of  carbon in soil, rotary tillage can be used to return the straw to the field,  while also spraying straw decomposer on its surface. This experiment used a new  straw decomposer rich in a variety of microorganisms, combined with the  comparison of a variety of straw return modes, and in-depth study of straw  decomposition effects of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Thus, a scheme that  can effectively improve the decomposition rate of straw and the content of  various forms of organic carbon in soil within a short period of time was  explored to provide theoretical support for the southern Liaoning.},

This research aimed to design and calibrate  a locally manufactured low-cost soil moisture sensor attached to a smart  monitoring unit operated by Solar Photo Voltaic Cells (SPVC). The designed sensor  was evaluated on clay textured soils in both lab and controlled greenhouse  environments. The calibration results demonstrated a strong correlation between  sensor readings and soil volumetric water content (θ(V)). Higher soil moisture  content was associated with decreased sensor output voltage with an average  determination coefficient (R(2)) of 0.967 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of  0.014. A sensor-to-sensor variability test was performed yielding a 0.045  coefficient of variation.

However, little is known about how soil erosion affects soil  microorganisms. Since 2012, we conducted a modified soil erosion simulation  experiment of topsoil removal method in an agricultural field to simulate erosion  depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm versus a control (0 cm). The results showed  that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria,  and Firmicutes were the dominant soil microbial (here: Bacteria and Archaea)  phyla, and Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, and  Actinospica were the dominant genera in all samples. The relative abundance of  Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Thaumarchaeota,  Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, Actinospica, and  Rhodanobacter decreased with the increase of erosion depths, while Chloroflexi  and Firmicutes increased with the increase of erosion depths. Soil microbial  community structure was altered significantly at 30- and 40-cm soil erosion depth  in comparison to control. Soil nutrient variability caused by soil erosion had a  greater impact on soil microbial community composition than that of soil  mechanical composition. Soil erosion indirectly affected microbial community  composition through negative effects on soil available potassium, total  phosphorus, total nitrogen, and sand content. We thus highlight the importance of  soil nutrients monitoring in different soil erosion levels to make the proper  ecological restoration strategies to improve soil environment which soil  microorganisms depend on.},

The  results showed that long-term phosphorus application significantly increased the  yield and phosphorus uptake of maize and wheat. The yield and phosphorus uptake  of maize and wheat showed a parabolic trend that first increased and then  decreased with the increases of phosphorus application. The utilization  efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer in the corn season was higher than that in  the wheat season under various phosphorus application treatments. The cumulative  utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer in the wheat season showed a  downward trend. The decline rate showed that optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater}  70\% optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater}130\% optimized phosphorus application. The  cumulative utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertili-zer in the corn season  showed an upward trend. For the rising rate, the optimized phosphorus application  {\textgreater} 70\% optimized phosphorus application {\textgreater} 130\% optimized phosphorus application.  Both the apparent phosphorus surplus and the accumulated phosphorus surplus of  the soil without phosphorus application were under phosphorus deficiency. Under  the treatment of phosphorus application, soil phosphorus showed a status of  phosphorus surplus. The higher the phosphorus application rate, the longer the  accumulation period, the higher the soil phosphorus surplus. Under the straw  returning condition, phosphorus application rate for wheat of 105-150 kg·hm(-2)  and the phosphorus application rate for maize of 63-90 kg·hm(-2) in Hebei  fluvo-aquic soil could ensure the high crop yield, keep the phosphorus  utilization efficiency at a high level, and reduce soil phosphorus accumulation  and environmental risks.},

In this paper, we first show how WUSNs can  operate reliably under field conditions year-round and at the same time be used  for determining and mapping soil conditions from the buried sensor nodes. We  demonstrate the design and deployment of a 23-node WUSN installed at an  agricultural field site that covers an area with a 530 m radius. The WUSN has  continuously operated since September 2019, enabling real-time monitoring of soil  volumetric water content (VWC), soil temperature (ST), and soil electrical  conductivity. Secondly, we present data collected over a nine-month period across  three seasons. We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in  predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength  (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, above-ground pathloss, the distance  between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative  humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model. The AT, RH,  and precipitation were obtained from a nearby weather station. We find that a  model with RSSI, D, AT, ST, and RH as inputs was able to predict soil VWC with an  R(2) of 0.82 for test datasets, with a Root Mean Square Error of ±0.012  (m(3)/m(3)). Hence, a combination of deep learning and other easily available  soil and climatic parameters can be a viable candidate for replacing expensive  soil VWC sensors in WUSNs.},

Yet, the accuracy and  precision of our forecasts remains limited by current tools and methods. To  overcome the limitations of process-based models and observed data, we  iteratively designed and tested a generalizable and robust data-assimilation  system that systematically constrains state variables in the APSIM model to  improve forecast accuracy and precision. Our final novel system utilizes the  Ensemble Kalman Filter to constrain model states and update model parameters at  observed time steps and incorporates an algorithm that improves system  performance through the joint estimation of system error matrices. We tested this  system at the Energy Farm, a well-monitored research site in central Illinois,  where we assimilated observed in situ soil moisture at daily time steps for two  years and evaluated how assimilation impacted model forecasts of soil moisture,  yield, leaf area index, tile flow, and nitrate leaching by comparing estimates  with in situ observations. The system improved the accuracy and precision of soil  moisture estimates for the assimilation layers by an average of 42\% and 48\%,  respectively, when compared to the free model. Such improvements led to changes  in the model's soil water and nitrogen processes and, on average, increased  accuracy in forecasts of annual tile flow by 43\% and annual nitrate loads by 10\%.  Forecasts of aboveground measures did not dramatically change with assimilation,  a fact which highlights the limited potential of soil moisture as a constraint  for a site with no water stress. Extending the scope of previous work, our  results demonstrate the power of data assimilation to constrain important model  estimates beyond the assimilated state variable, such as nitrate leaching.  Replication of this study is necessary to further define the limitations and  opportunities of the developed system.},

Canopy  hyperspectral data of WSR was obtained; meanwhile, duplex PCR was used to measure  the content of Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) in the same canopy  section. The content of Pst corresponded to its spectrum as the classification  label of the model, which is established by discriminant partial least squares  (DPLS) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In the spectral region of  325-1075 nm, the model's average recognition accuracy was between 75\% and 80\%. In  the sub-band of 325-1075 nm, the average recognition accuracy of the DPLS was 80\%  within the 325-474 nm. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM was 83\% within  the 475-624 nm. Correlation analysis showed that the disease index of WSR was  positively correlated with soil nitrogen nutrition, indicating that the soil  nitrogen nutrition would affect the severity of WSR during the latent period.},

This  study represents the first attempt connecting cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS)  with soil erosion research, a novel approach to explore the complex relationships  between soil water content (SWC) and soil redistribution processes using two of  the most powerful nuclear techniques, CRNS and fallout (137)Cs.

The Empirical Orthogonal  Function (EOF) analysis of the comprehensive data from seven CRNS surveys  revealed that one dominant spatial structure (EOF1) explains 89.2\% of SMSV. The  soil redistribution rates estimated with (137)Cs at the nine locations along the  hillslope, together with local factors related to soil properties (SOC, soil  depth, hydraulic conductivity) and land use showed significant correlations with  EOF. This study provides strong field evidence that soil type significantly  affect SMSV, highlighting the key impact on soil erosion and sedimentation rates.  Nevertheless, more research is needed to investigate the specific contributions  of soil properties to the spatial variability of soil moisture and their  subsequent effects on soil redistribution dynamics of interest for soil  management.},

	abstract = {Assessing the spatial distribution of organic matter and total nitrogen in soil is essential for management and optimum utilization of fertilizers. Therefore,  the present field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of different  planting pattern arrangements on the spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen  and organic matter content under a maize/soybean strip relay intercropping  system. The planting was arranged in a manner such that soil sampling could be  done from continuous maize/soybean relay strip intercropping (MS1), maize/soybean  relay strip intercropping in rotation (MS2), traditional maize/soybean  intercropping (MS3), sole maize (M), sole soybean (S), and fallow land (FL) from  2018 to 2020. The results showed significant variations for soil organic matter  and total nitrogen content under different planting pattern arrangements of maize  and soybean in the strip relay intercropping system. Across all systems, the  highest soil organic matter (29.19 g/kg) and total nitrogen (10.19 g/kg) were  recorded in MS2. In contrast, the lowest soil organic matter (1.69 g/kg) and  total nitrogen (0.64 g/kg) were observed in FL. Soil organic matter and total  nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared  with FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and  164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL. Furthermore, under MS2, the spatial  distribution of soil organic matter was higher in both maize and soybean crop  rows as compared with other cropping patterns, whereas the soil total nitrogen  was higher under soybean rows as compared with maize in all other treatment.  However, correlation analysis of the treatments showed variations in organic  matter content. It can be concluded that different planting patterns can have  varying effects on soil organic matter and total nitrogen distribution under the  strip relay intercropping system. Moreover, it is recommended from this study  that MS2 is a better planting pattern for the strip relay intercropping system,  which can increase the spatial distribution of soil organic matter and total  nitrogen, thereby improving soil fertility, C:N ratio, and crop production. This  study will serve as a foundation towards the scientific usage of chemical  fertilizers in agricultural sector.},

	abstract = {There is a need for low-cost, high-accuracy measurement of water content in various materials. This study assesses the performance of a new microwave swept  frequency domain instrument (SFI) that has promise to provide a low-cost,  high-accuracy alternative to the traditional and more expensive time domain  reflectometry (TDR). The technique obtains permittivity measurements of soils in  the frequency domain utilizing a through transmission configuration,  transmissometry, which provides a frequency domain transmissometry measurement  (FDT). The measurement is comparable to time domain transmissometry (TDT) with  the added advantage of also being able to separately quantify the real and  imaginary portions of the complex permittivity so that the measured bulk  permittivity is more accurate that the measurement TDR provides where the  apparent permittivity is impacted by the signal loss, which can be significant in  heavier soils. The experimental SFI was compared with a high-end 12 GHz TDR/TDT  system across a range of soils at varying soil water contents and densities. As  propagation delay is the fundamental measurement of interest to the  well-established TDR or TDT technique; the first set of tests utilized precision  propagation delay lines to test the accuracy of the SFI instrument's ability to  resolve propagation delays across the expected range of delays that a soil probe  would present when subjected to the expected range of soil types and soil  moisture typical to an agronomic cropping system. The results of the  precision-delay line testing suggests the instrument is capable of predicting  propagation delays with a RMSE of +/-105 ps across the range of delays ranging  from 0 to 12,000 ps with a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.998. The  second phase of tests noted the rich history of TDR for prediction of soil  moisture and leveraged this history by utilizing TDT measured with a high-end  Hewlett Packard TDR/TDT instrument to directly benchmark the SFI instrument over  a range of soil types, at varying levels of moisture. This testing protocol was  developed to provide the best possible comparison between SFI to TDT than would  otherwise be possible by using soil moisture as the bench mark, due to variations  in soil density between soil water content levels which are known to impact the  calibration between TDR's estimate of soil water content from the measured  propagation delay which is converted to an apparent permittivity measurement.  This experimental decision, to compare propagation delay of TDT to FDT,  effectively removes the errors due to variations in packing density from the  evaluation and provides a direct comparison between the SFI instrument and the  time domain technique of TDT. The tests utilized three soils (a sand, an Acuff  loam and an Olton clay-loam) that were packed to varying bulk densities and  prepared to provide a range of water contents and electrical conductivities by  which to compare the performance of the SFI technology to TDT measurements of  propagation delay. For each sample tested, the SFI instrument and the TDT both  performed the measurements on the exact same probe, thereby both instruments were  measuring the exact same soil/soil-probe response to ensure the most accurate  means to compare the SFI instrument to a high-end TDT instrument. Test results  provided an estimated instrumental accuracy for the SFI of +/-0.98\% of full  scale, RMSE basis, for the precision delay lines and +/-1.32\% when the SFI was  evaluated on loam and clay loam soils, in comparison to TDT as the bench-mark.  Results from both experiments provide evidence that the low-cost SFI approach is  a viable alternative to conventional TDR/TDT for high accuracy applications.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Greater amounts of fertilizer are applied every year to meet the growing demand for food. Sugarcane is one of the important food sources for human  beings. METHODS: Here, we evaluated the effects of a sugarcane-Dictyophora  indusiata (DI) intercropping system on soil health by conducting an experiment  with three different treatments: (1) bagasse application (BAS process), (2)  bagasse + DI (DIS process), and (3) the control (CK). We then analyzed soil  chemistry, the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, and the composition of  metabolites to clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of this intercropping  system on soil properties. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Soil chemistry analyses  revealed that the content of several soil nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and  phosphorus (P) was higher in the BAS process than in the CK. In the DIS process,  a large amount of soil P was consumed by DI. At the same time, the urease  activity was inhibited, thus slowing down the loss of soil in the DI process,  while the activity of other enzymes such as β-glucosidase and laccase was  increased. It was also noticed that the content of lanthanum and calcium was  higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and DI did not  significantly alter the concentrations of these soil metal ions. Bacterial  diversity was higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and fungal  diversity was lower in the DIS process than in the other treatments. The soil  metabolome analysis revealed that the abundance of carbohydrate metabolites was  significantly lower in the BAS process than in the CK and the DIS process. The  abundance of D(+)-talose was correlated with the content of soil nutrients. Path  analysis revealed that the content of soil nutrients in the DIS process was  mainly affected by fungi, bacteria, the soil metabolome, and soil enzyme  activity. Our findings indicate that the sugarcane-DIS intercropping system can  enhance soil health.},

	abstract = {One reason arid and semi-arid environments have been used to store waste is due to low groundwater recharge, presumably limiting the potential for meteoric water  to mobilize and transport contaminants into groundwater. The U.S. Department of  Energy Office of Legacy Management (LM) is evaluating selected uranium mill  tailings disposal cell covers to be managed as evapotranspiration (ET) covers,  where vegetation is used to naturally remove water from the cover profile via  transpiration, further reducing deep percolation. An important parameter in  monitoring the performance of ET covers is soil moisture (SM). If SM is too high,  water may drain into tailings material, potentially transporting contaminants  into groundwater; if SM is too low, radon flux may increase through the cover.  However, monitoring SM via traditional instrumentation is invasive, expensive,  and may fail to account for spatial heterogeneity, especially over vegetated  disposal cells. Here we investigated the potential for non-invasive SM monitoring  using radar remote sensing and other geospatial data to see if this approach  could provide a practical, accurate, and spatially comprehensive tool to monitor  SM. We used theoretical simulations to analyze the sensitivity of multi-frequency  radar backscatter to SM at different depths of a field-scale (3 ha) drainage  lysimeter embedded within an in-service LM disposal cell. We then evaluated a  shallow and deep form of machine learning (ML) using Google Earth Engine to  integrate multi-source observations and estimate the SM profile across six soil  layers from depths of 0-2 m. The ML models were trained using in situ SM  measurements from 2019 and validated using data from 2014 to 2018 and 2020-2021.  Model predictors included backscatter observations from satellite synthetic  aperture radar, vegetation, temperature products from optical infrared sensors,  and accumulated, gridded rainfall data. The radar simulations confirmed that the  lower frequencies (L- and P-band) and smaller incidence angles show better  sensitivity to deeper soil layers and an overall larger SM dynamic range relative  to the higher frequencies (C- and X-band). The ML models produced accurate SM  estimates throughout the soil profile (r values from 0.75 to 0.94;  RMSE = 0.003-0.017 cm(3)/cm(3); bias = 0.00 cm(3)/cm(3)), with the simpler  shallow-learning approach outperforming a selected deep-learning model. The ML  models we developed provide an accurate, cost-effective tool for monitoring SM  within ET covers that could be applied to other vegetated disposal cell covers,  potentially including those with rock-armored covers.},

The emergence of wireless sensor networks has  effectively solved the problems existing in radio technology, but traditional  wireless sensor networks and radio technology networks cannot be directly applied  to wireless sensors. On this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil  nutrient variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to  traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient  variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing  the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland.  Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern  technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal  variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has  the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides  new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land  development and consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of  statistical quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional  statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a given  location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze the relationship  between several natural factors and quantitative estimation of soil protection.  Based on wireless sensor technology, this paper studies the variability of  farmland soil nutrients and statistical quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a  foundation for the development of agriculture and statistics.},

The HETDR probe consists of three rods of stainless steel and a cuboid  head: A center electrode and two outer electrodes are connected to the inner and  outer conductors of a coaxial cable, respectively. An acrylic container divided  into several segments was used to prepare nonuniformly wetted soils with  different water contents for a series of model tests. The HETDR probe was placed  horizontally at the middle height of each soil specimen, while a conventional  time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe was applied vertically on the surface of  the specimen. The experimental results show that as the soil water content (SWC)  at a segment increases, the average amplitude decreases and the duration  increases. The estimated SWC increases with the measured SWC, and especially, the  difference between actual segment length and the segment length estimated from  the HETDR probes is significant under dry conditions. This study demonstrates  that HETDR may be a promising field-testing method for evaluating the average  water content in nonuniformly wetted soils.},

	abstract = {Live fuel moisture content (LFMC), which is the ratio of water in the fresh biomass to the dry biomass, is a key variable that affects wildfire behaviour.  Previous studies have assessed soil moisture as a predictor of LFMC over small  areas with limited data, but a comprehensive evaluation at sub-continental scale  is still lacking, and the explanatory utility has not been evaluated under  different aridity conditions. In this study, the utility was evaluated using  microwave soil moisture data from the ESA ECV\_SM product from 1979 to 2018 and  LFMC data from over 1000 sites in the coterminous United States. A time-lagged  robust linear regression model was adopted, and the results were compared with  analysis from in situ soil moisture measurements at adjacent sites. The results  suggested that at most sites the LFMC correlates best with soil moisture within  60 days prior to LFMC sampling, and that the correlation is lower in areas with  complex terrain. LFMC can be estimated from soil moisture with a mean RMSE of  around 20\%. The correlation between LFMC and soil moisture is significant  (p{\textless}0.01) in most regions, and is mostly stable in different years. The major fuel  types with a high response to soil moisture include pine, redcedar, sagebrush,  oak, manzanita, chamise, mesquite and juniper, depending on the region. The LFMC  {\textasciitilde} soil moisture correlation varies with the aridity condition, and soil moisture  has a higher explanatory utility on LFMC under dry conditions. An analysis using  SMAP Level-4 product indicated that the surface and root-zone soil moisture  perform similarly in LFMC estimation. This study suggests that microwave soil  moisture data contain sufficient information on LFMC, and may serve as a  reference for the development of more sophisticated LFMC estimation methods.},

The current study compared and assessed the  performance of different interpolation methods for estimating soil moisture in an  area with complex topography in southwest China. The approaches were inverse  distance weighting, multifarious forms of kriging, regularized spline with  tension, and thin plate spline. The 5-day soil moisture observed at 167 stations  and daily temperature recorded at 33 stations during the period of 2010-2014 were  used in the current work. Model performance was tested with accuracy indicators  of determination coefficient (R (2)), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root  mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and modeling  efficiency (ME). The results indicated that inverse distance weighting had the  best performance with R (2), MAPE, RMSE, RRMSE, and ME of 0.32, 14.37, 13.02\%,  0.16, and 0.30, respectively. Based on the best method, a spatial database of  soil moisture was developed and used to investigate drought condition over the  study area. The results showed that the distribution of drought was characterized  by evidently regional difference. Besides, drought mainly occurred in August and  September in the 5 years and was prone to happening in the western and central  parts rather than in the northeastern and southeastern areas.},

The near infrared sensor can be used to detect  the soil nitrogen content rapidly, nondestructively, and conveniently. In order  to investigate the effect of the different soil water content on soil nitrogen  detection by near infrared sensor, the soil samples were dealt with different  drying times and the corresponding water content was measured. The drying time  was set from 1 h to 8 h, and every 1 h 90 samples (each nitrogen concentration of  10 samples) were detected. The spectral information of samples was obtained by  near infrared sensor, meanwhile, the soil water content was calculated every 1 h.  The prediction model of soil nitrogen content was established by two linear  modeling methods, including partial least squares (PLS) and uninformative  variable elimination (UVE). The experiment shows that the soil has the highest  detection accuracy when the drying time is 3 h and the corresponding soil water  content is 1.03\%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration set are 0.9721  and 0.9656, and the correlation coefficients of the prediction set are 0.9712 and  0.9682, respectively. The prediction accuracy of both models is high, while the  prediction effect of PLS model is better and more stable. The results indicate  that the soil water content at 1.03\% has the minimum influence on the detection  of soil nitrogen content using a near infrared sensor while the detection  accuracy is the highest and the time cost is the lowest, which is of great  significance to develop a portable apparatus detecting nitrogen in the field  accurately and rapidly.},

	abstract = {The improvement of water management in agriculture by exactly detecting moisture parameters of soil is crucial. To investigate this problem, a mini inside-out  nuclear magnetic resonance sensor (NMR) was proposed to measure moisture  parameters of model soils. This sensor combines three cylindrical magnets that  are magnetized in the axial direction and three arc spiral coils of the same size  in series. We calculated and optimized the magnet structure by equivalent  magnetization to current density. By adjusting the radius and height between the  cylinders, a circumferential symmetric constant gradient field (2.28 T/m) was  obtained. The NMR sensor was set at 2.424 MHz to measure the water content of  sandy soil with small particle diameter and silica sand with large particle  diameter. The complete decaying, an NMR signal was analyzed through inverse  Laplace transformation and averaged on a T₂ space. According to the results,  moisture content of the sample is positively correlated with the integral area of  T₂ spectrum peak (A(peak)); T₂ of the water in small pores is shorter than that  in large pores, because the movement of water molecules are limited by the inner  wall of the pores. In the same volume, water in large pore sample is more than  that in small pore sample, so A(peak) of silica sand is larger than A(peak) of  sandy soil. Therefore, the sensor is capable of detecting moisture both content  and pore size of the sample. This mini sensor (4.0 cm in diameter and 10 cm in  length) is portable, and the lowest measurable humidity is 0.38\%. Thus, this  sensor will allow easy soil moisture measurements on-field in the future.},

Its major purpose is to make  horticultural operations simpler to identify, assess, and manage. This paper uses  the proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision  agriculture farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and increase  production yield by comparing water content during various stages of plant growth  and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. It also optimizes the water  level for future irrigation decisions to maintain crop growth and water  stability. The data must be served and stored in the form of a grid view,  according to Apriori and GRU (gated recurrent unit). Using numerous sensor and  parameter modelling methodologies, this system assists in the prediction of  irrigation planning based on irrigation needs. The predicted parameters include  soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This observed experimental data  supports smart irrigation in crop production with a high yield and little water  use.

The general  likelihood uncertainty estimation revealed the sensitivity of individual model  parameters. As it was assumed, a simple structure of statistical models was  achieved but no direct physical interpretation of their parameters, contrary to a  physically-based method. The TDR technique proved useful for the calibration of  different soil moisture models and a satisfactory quality for their future  exploitation.},

	abstract = {Soil nutrient management is a key component contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) flux and mitigation potential of agricultural production systems. However,  the effect of soil nutrient management practices on GHG flux and global warming  potential (GWP) is less understood in agricultural soils of India. The present  study was conducted to compare three nutrient management systems practiced for  nine consecutive years in a soybean-wheat cropping system in the Vertisols of  India, in terms of GHG flux and GWP. The treatments were composed of 100\% organic  (ONM), 100\% inorganic (NPK), and integrated nutrient management (INM) with 50\%  organic + 50\% inorganic inputs. The gas samples for GHGs (CO(2), CH(4), and  N(2)O) were collected by static chamber method at about 15-day interval during  2012-13 growing season. The change in soil organic carbon (SOC) content was  estimated in terms of the changes in SOC stock in the 0-15 cm soil over the  9-year period covering 2004 to 2013. There was a net uptake of CH(4) in all the  treatments in both soybean and wheat crop seasons. The cumulative N(2)O and CO(2)  emissions were in the order of INM {\textgreater} ONM {\textgreater} NPK with significant difference  between treatments (p {\textless} 0.05) in both the crop seasons. The annual GWP, expressed  in terms of CH(4) and N(2)O emission, also followed the same trend and was  estimated to be 1126, 1002, and 896 kg CO(2) eq ha(-1) year(-1) under INM, ONM,  and NPK treatments, respectively. However, the change in SOC stock was  significantly higher under ONM (1250 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) followed by INM  (417 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and least under NPK (198 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) treatment.  The wheat equivalent yield was similar under ONM and INM treatments and was  significantly lower under NPK treatment. Thus, the GWP per unit grain yield was  lower under ONM followed by NPK and INM treatments and varied from 250, 261, and  307 kg CO(2) eq Mg(-1) grain yield under ONM, NPK, and INM treatments,  respectively.},

Microbial inoculants improved shoot height, tiller numbers,  fresh weight and dry biomass. Co-inoculation was more impactful in enhancing  plant growth and development as compared to single inoculation. Single and  co-inoculation improved organic carbon (OC) and N, P and K content in the soil  substantially. Mean values between control and co-inoculation varied  significantly for OC in PB1612 (p0.001) and CO51 (p0.019) and phosphorus content  in PB1612 (p0.044) and CO51 (p0.021). Microbial inoculation enhanced soil  nutrients and increased their bioavailability for the plants. Total  polyphenolics, flavonoids and protein content increased in the leaves following  microbial inoculation. Enhanced non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters (ABTS, DPPH,  Fe-ion reducing power and Fe-ion chelation) was found in microbe inoculated rice  reflecting high free radical scavenging activity in polyphenolics-rich leaf  extracts. Increased enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione  reductase (GR), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (PO), glutathione  peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) showed improved  ROS scavenging in rice plants having co-inoculation. Over-expression of PAL,  cCuZn-SOD and CAT genes in microbial inoculated rice plants was recorded. The  study concludes that plant stage-wise concomitant fortification by microbial  inoculants could play multi-pronged manifestations at physiological, biochemical  and molecular level in rice to positively influence growth, development and  defense attributes in plants.},

	abstract = {Preventing soil nitrogen (N) losses driven by microbial nitrification and denitrification contributes to improving global environmental concerns caused by  NO(3)(-)-N leaching and N(2)O emission. Quorum sensing (QS) signals regulate  nitrification and denitrification of N-cycling bacteria in pure culture and water  treatment systems, and mediate the composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)  and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in activated sludge. However, whether  disrupting QS could prevent soil N losses remains unclear. This study explored  the feasibility of applying quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) as an innovative  strategy to reduce N losses from agricultural soils. The two QSIs, penicillic  acid and 4-iodo-N-[(3S)-tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl]-benzeneacetamide (4-iodo  PHL), were more effective in reducing N losses than traditional inhibitors,  including N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate.  After 36 days of aerobic incubation, penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL inhibited  nitrification by 39\% and 68\%, respectively. The inhibitory effects are attributed  to the fact that 4-iodo PHL decreased the abundance of archaeal and bacterial  amoA genes, as well as the relative abundance of Candidatus Nitrocosmicus (AOA),  Candidatus Nitrososphaera (AOA), and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing  bacteria/comammox), while penicillic acid reduced archaeal amoA abundance and the  relative abundance of Nitrosospira (AOB) and the microbes listed above.  Penicillic acid also strongly inhibited denitrification (33\%) and N(2)O emissions  (61\%) at the peak of N(2)O production (day 4 of anaerobic incubation) via  decreasing nitrate reductase gene (narG) abundance and increasing N(2)O reductase  gene (nosZ) abundance, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental risks of QSIs  to microbial community structure and network stability, CO(2) emissions, and soil  animals were acceptable. Overall, QSIs have application potential in agriculture  to reduce soil N losses and the associated effect on climate change. This study  established a new method to mitigate N losses from the perspective of QS, and can  serve as important basis of decreasing the environmental risks of agricultural  non-point source pollution.},

	abstract = {Capacitance sensors are widely used in agriculture for irrigation and soil management purposes. However, their use under saline conditions is a major  challenge, especially for sensors operating with low frequency. Their dielectric  readings are often biased by high soil electrical conductivity. New calculation  approaches for soil water content (θ) and pore water electrical conductivity  (ECp), in which apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) is included, have  been suggested in recent research. However, these methods have neither been  tested with low-cost capacitance probes such as the 5TE (70 MHz, Decagon Devices,  Pullman, WA, USA) nor for field conditions. Thus, it is important to determine  the performance of these approaches and to test the application range using the  5TE sensor for irrigated soils. For this purpose, sandy soil was collected from  the Jemna oasis in southern Tunisia and four 5TE sensors were installed in the  field at four soil depths. Measurements of apparent dielectric permittivity (Ka),  ECa, and soil temperature were taken under different electrical conductivity of  soil moisture solutions. Results show that, under field conditions, 5TE accuracy  for θ estimation increased when considering the ECa effect. Field calibrated  models gave better θ estimation (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.03 m(3) m(-3))  as compared to laboratory experiments (RMSE = 0.06 m(3) m(-3)). For ECp  prediction, two corrections of the Hilhorst model were investigated. The first  approach, which considers the ECa effect on K' reading, failed to improve the  Hilhorst model for ECp {\textgreater} 3 dS m(-1) for both laboratory and field conditions.  However, the second approach, which considers the effect of ECa on the soil  parameter K(0), increased the performance of the Hilhorst model and gave accurate  measurements of ECp using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soil.},

The probe directly measures the complex  dielectric permittivity spectrum and for this purpose requires three calibration  media: air, water, and ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to  study the influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the  probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as a  verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soils-sandy loam and two  silt loams-with six water contents from air-dry to saturation. The conversion  from S 11 parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network  analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid procedure.  The simulation and measurement results for the real part of the isopropanol  dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers with different diameters  were in good agreement with literature data up to 200 MHz. The real part of the  dielectric permittivity was extracted and related to the moisture of the tested  soil samples. Relations between the volumetric water content and the real part of  the dielectric permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by  TDR) were compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to  Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data calculated  according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and Roth gave results  closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results indicated that the seven-rod  probe can be used to accurately measure of the dielectric permittivity spectrum  in a well-defined sample volume of about 8 cm³ in the frequency range from 20 MHz  to 200 MHz.},

The system  identifies droughts and other climate anomalies such as extreme precipitation and  heat stress. However, the LIGHTS model lacks input from soil moisture  observations. This research aims to develop a simple and easy-to-interpret soil  moisture and drought warning index - Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) - by  fusing the space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data  with the NLDAS climate index. Ground truth soil moisture data from the Soil  Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) were collected for validation. As a result, the  accuracy of using SMAP to monitor soil moisture content generally displayed a  good statistical correlation with the SCAN data. The validation through the  Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)  suggested that SSI was effective and sensitive for short-term drought monitoring  across large areas.},

The control terminal adjusts the irrigation water volume  according to the transmitted information, which is significant for increasing the  crop yield. One of the main challenges of SMWSNs in practical applications is to  maximize the coverage area under certain conditions of monitoring area and to  minimize the number of nodes used. Therefore, a new adaptive Cauchy variant  butterfly optimization algorithm (ACBOA) has been designed to effectively improve  the network coverage. More importantly, new Cauchy variants and adaptive factors  for improving the global and local search ability of ACBOA, respectively, are  designed. In addition, a new coverage optimization model for SMWSNs that  integrates node coverage and network quality of service is developed.  Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared with other swarm intelligence  algorithms, namely, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), artificial bee colony  algorithm (ABC), fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and particle swarm  optimization algorithm (PSO), under the conditions of a certain initial  population size and number of iterations for the fairness and objectivity of  simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the coverage rate of  SMWSNs after ACBOA optimization increases by 9.09\%, 13.78\%, 2.57\%, and 11.11\%  over BOA, ABC, FOA, and PSO optimization, respectively.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of soil water content plays a key role in water management efforts to improve irrigation efficiency. Among the indirect estimation methods of soil  water content via Earth Observation data is the triangle method, used to analyze  optical and thermal features because these are primarily controlled by water  content within the near-surface evaporation layer and root zone in bare and  vegetated soils. Although the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer theory  describes the ongoing processes, theoretical models reveal limits for operational  use. When applying simplified empirical formulations, meteorological forcing  could be replaced with alternative variables when the above-canopy temperature is  unknown, to mitigate the effects of calibration inaccuracies or to account for  the temporal admittance of the soil. However, if applied over a limited area, a  characterization of both dry and wet edges could not be properly achieved; thus,  a multi-temporal analysis can be exploited to include outer extremes in soil  water content. A diachronic empirical approach introduces the need to assume a  constancy of other meteorological forcing variables that control thermal  features. Airborne images were acquired on a Sicilian vineyard during most of an  entire irrigation period (fruit-set to ripening stages, vintage 2008), during  which in situ soil water content was measured to set up the triangle method.  Within this framework, we tested the triangle method by employing alternative  thermal forcing. The results were inaccurate when air temperature at airborne  acquisition was employed. Sonic and aerodynamic air temperatures confirmed and  partially explained the limits of simultaneous meteorological forcing, and the  use of proxy variables improved model accuracy. The analysis indicates that high  spatial resolution does not necessarily imply higher accuracies.},

The results indicated that 100\%, 93\%, and 74\% of the study areas  for CCE, pH, and EC fell into the low, moderate, and moderate to high NIV  classes, respectively. Also, 25\% of the area is classified as low fertility  (NIV {\textless} 1.67), 75\% falls under medium fertility (1.67 {\textless} NIV value {\textless} 2.33), and  none in high fertility (NIV value {\textgreater} 2.33).

The study is based on extensive field surveys conducted from  2005 to 2009 in the Campidano plain of Sardinia, Italy. A total of 12 small bare  soil fields were sampled for moisture, surface roughness, and texture values.  From field scale analysis with ENVISAT ASAR (C-band, VV polarized, descending  mode, incidence angle from 15.0° to 31.4°), an empirical model for estimating  bare soil moisture was established, with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of  0.85. LANDSAT TM5 images were also used for soil moisture estimation using the  TVX slope (temperature/vegetation index), and in this case the best linear  relationship had an R(2) of 0.81. A cross-validation on the two empirical models  demonstrated the potential of C-band SAR data for estimation of surface moisture,  with and R(2) of 0.76 (bias +0.3\% and RMSE 7\%) for ENVISAT ASAR and 0.54 (bias  +1.3\% and RMSE 5\%) for LANDSAT TM5. The two models developed at plot level were  then applied over the Campidano plain and assessed via multitemporal and spatial  analyses, in the latter case against soil permeability data from a pedological  map of Sardinia. Encouraging estimated soil moisture (ESM) maps were obtained for  the SAR-based model, whereas the LANDSAT-based model would require a better field  data set for validation, including ground data collected on vegetated fields. ESM  maps showed sensitivity to soil drainage qualities or drainage potential, which  could be useful in irrigation management and other agricultural applications.},

The label is  composed of a semi-active system that measures temperature, light, relative  humidity and gravimetric water content (GWC) in the soil. The deployed system  provides a simple, cost effective solution to monitor and control the growing of  plants in modern agriculture and is intended be a part of a smart wireless sensor  network (WSN) for agricultural monitoring. This paper is focused on analysis and  development of a moisture sensor to measure GWC. It is based on a capacitance  measurement solution, the accuracy of which is enhanced using several sensor  driving frequencies. Thanks to the cancellation of supply voltage variations, the  modeling of the GWC sensor and readout circuit was correct. The results we  measured were close to modeled values. The maximum measurement resolution of the  capacitive moisture sensor was 0.07 pF. To get the GWC from measured capacitance,  a scale was used to weigh the mass of water in the soil. The comparison between  capacitance measurement and calculated soil GWC is presented. The RFID  measurement system has energy harvesting capabilities and an ultra-low power  microcontroller, which uses embedded software to control the measurement  properties. The microcontroller has to choose the appropriate model depending on  the measured amplitude and chosen frequency to calculate the actual voltage on  the sensing capacitor.},

	abstract = {Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production in  response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of  structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation  management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated,  low-cost, and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop  modeling combined with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive  capability. This study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc.  SM100 soil moisture sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning  models, with both laboratory and field data. The best calibration technique,  field-based piece-wise linear regression (calibration r(2) = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 \%,  validation r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), was used to study the effect of sensor  calibration on the performance of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS)  model by calibrating its soil hydraulic parameters. This approach was tested  during the wheat cropping season in 2018, in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic  plains, resulting in some best practices regarding sensor calibration being  recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated best in field conditions  against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100) taken as a reference  (r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), followed by laboratory calibration against  gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r(2) = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 \%) and  wet-up curves respectively (r(2) = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 \%). Moreover, model  overfitting with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation  performance. The soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly  by incorporating raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There  were non-significant impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity  improved significantly. Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate  AquaCrop led to poorer performances than using the literature. Hence using  literature values could save sensor costs without compromising model performance  if sensor calibration was not possible. The results suggest the essentiality of  calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors for crop modeling calibration to  improve crop water productivity.},

In modern agricultural  production, which is intensive and should at the same time be environmentally  friendly, there is a need to monitor soil moisture, salinity and temperature. The  aim of the study was to determine the demand of producers of agricultural and  horticultural plants for equipment and systems for monitoring soil properties at  an individual farm level in regions with highly developed agriculture. A  questionnaire survey was conducted among 1087 respondents, also direct interviews  in Poland were undertaken. According to the producers' responses, it is important  to know soil moisture, salinity and temperature, although currently only about 4\%  of the surveyed farmers have the equipment to evaluate these soil parameters. In  their view cost is not the most important obstacle to the purchase of the  necessary probes. More important is that the devices should be easy to install  and use, and have an easy to use application for data collection, processing and  transfer. The current market does not offer solutions that meet these producers  expectations. The demand for suitable probes is very high as over 80\% of the  farmers declared their willingness to purchase such probes. Technical problems  related to the operation and servicing of such equipment were the most frequently  mentioned impediments in their use. However, farmers and horticulturists believe  that knowledge of their soil properties would allow them to optimize the elements  of cultivation technology, including the use of plant irrigation systems, the use  of mineral fertilizers and plant protection products.},

We describe a study to  validate and improve soil moisture content retrieval and mapping from  hyperspectral imagery collected by a UAS system. Our approach uses a recently  developed model known as the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil  reflectance (MARMIT). MARMIT partitions contributions due to water and the  sediment surface into equivalent but separate layers and describes these layers  using an equivalent slab model formalism. The model water layer thickness along  with the fraction of wet surface become parameters that must be optimized in a  calibration step, with extinction due to water absorption being applied in the  model based on equivalent water layer thickness, while transmission and  reflection coefficients follow the Fresnel formalism. In this work, we evaluate  the model in both field settings, using UAS hyperspectral imagery, and laboratory  settings, using hyperspectral spectra obtained with a goniometer. Sediment  samples obtained from four different field sites representing disparate  environmental settings comprised the laboratory analysis while field validation  used hyperspectral UAS imagery and coordinated ground truth obtained on a barrier  island shore during field campaigns in 2018 and 2019. Analysis of the most  significant wavelengths for retrieval indicate a number of different wavelengths  in the short-wave infra-red (SWIR) that provide accurate fits to measured soil  moisture content in the laboratory with normalized root mean square error  (NRMSE){\textless} 0.145, while independent evaluation from sequestered test data from the  hyperspectral UAS imagery obtained during the field campaign obtained an average  NRMSE = 0.169 and median NRMSE = 0.152 in a bootstrap analysis.},

However, the influence of the time lag effect between canopy temperature and air  temperature on the accuracy of soil moisture monitoring with different CWSI  models has not been further investigated. Therefore, based on the continuous  record of canopy temperature and air temperature, this study explored the  influence of canopy-air temperature hysteresis on the diagnosis of soil moisture  with three CWSI models (CWSIT-theoretical, CWSIE-empirical, CWSIH-hybrid). The  results show (1) the peak time of canopy temperature was ahead of that of air  temperature, and the lag time varied under different soil moisture conditions.  When the soil moisture was seriously deficient, the lag time decreased. However,  from jointing-heading period to filling-ripening period, the lag time became  longer. (2) The values of CWSIT, CWSIE, and CWSIH decreased when the time lag  effect was considered. In jointing-heading period, heading-filling period, and  filling-ripening period, CWSIT had the highest accuracy in soil moisture  monitoring without the consideration of the time lag effect. When the time lag  effect was considered, the monitoring accuracy of CWSIE and CWSIH was greatly  improved and higher than that of CWSIT, while that of CWSIT was reduced. The  findings provided a basis for further improving the accuracy of soil moisture  monitoring with CWSI models.},

Therefore, in this  study, we developed a sensor that can simultaneously measure soil water content  (θ), electrical conductivity (σ(b)), temperature, and matric potential (ψ). The  proposed sensor can determine θ and σ(b) using time domain transmissiometry and  can determine ψ based on the capacitance of the accompanying ceramic plate. A  series of laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance  of the sensor. The sensor output values were correlated with the soil properties,  and the temperature dependence of the sensor outputs was evaluated. Additionally,  field tests were conducted to measure transient soil conditions over a long  period. The results show that the developed sensor can measure each soil property  with acceptable accuracy. Moreover, the root-mean-square errors of the sensor and  reference values were 1.7 for the dielectric constant (which is equivalent to θ),  62 mS m(-1) for σ(b), and 0.05-0.88 for log ψ. The temperature dependence was not  a problem, except when ψ was below -100 kPa. The sensor can be used for long-term  measurements in agricultural fields and exhibited sufficient lifetime and  performance. We believe that the developed sensor can contribute to smart  agriculture and research on heat and mass transfer in soil.},

The use of drought-tolerant plants such as Sedum species, reduces the water  requirements in the dry season, but, even so, in semiarid environments these can  reach up to 60 L m(-2) per day. Continuous substrate/soil water content  monitoring would facilitate the efficient use of this critical resource. In this  context, the use of plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) emerges as a suitable and  more sustainable alternative for monitoring water content in green roofs in  semiarid climates. In this study, bench and pilot-scale experiments using seven  Sedum species showed a positive relationship between current generation and water  content in the substrate. PMFC reactors with higher water content (around 27\% vs.  17.5\% v/v) showed larger power density (114.6 and 82.3 μW m(-2) vs. 32.5 μW  m(-2)). Moreover, a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (±0.01) between current  density and water content was observed.

The NN was trained on GEOS-5  soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5  climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without  further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements,  the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly  correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66,  respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3),  0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN)  measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a  significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower  correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of  the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as  well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals  were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval  products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced  Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil  moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar  spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely  vegetated regions and transition zones.},

However, very few studies have assessed how the winter  drought affected soil N availability during the subsequent growing season under  chemical fertilization. We conducted a field investigation involving snow removal  to simulate winter drought conditions in a Mollisol cropland in Northeast China  as part of a 6-year fertilization experiment, and we examined soil  physicochemical properties, microbial characteristics, and N availability. Our  results demonstrated that chemical fertilization significantly increased soil  ammonium and total N availability by 42.9 and 90.3\%, respectively; a combined  winter drought and fertilization treatment exhibited the highest soil N  availability at the end of the growing season. As the growing season continued,  the variation in soil N availability was explained more by fertilization than by  winter drought. The Mantel test further indicated that soil Olsen-P content and  microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) were significantly related to soil ammonium  availability. A microbial community structure explained the largest fraction of  the variation in soil nitrate availability. Microbial CUE showed the strongest  correlation with soil N availability, followed by soil available C:P and  bacteria:fungi ratios under winter drought and chemical fertilization conditions.  Overall, we clarified that, despite the weak effect of the winter drought on soil  N availability, it cannot be ignored. Our study also identified the important  role of soil microorganisms in soil N transformations, even in seasonally  snow-covered northern croplands.},

	abstract = {From an agricultural perspective, drought refers to an unusual deficiency of plant available water in the root-zone of the soil profile. This paper focuses on  evaluating the benefit of assimilating soil moisture retrievals from the Soil  Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission into the USDA-FAS Palmer model for  agricultural drought monitoring. This will be done by examining the standardized  soil moisture anomaly index. The skill of the SMAP-enhanced Palmer model is  assessed over three agricultural regions that have experienced major drought  since the launch of SMAP in early 2015: (1) the 2015 drought in California (CA),  USA, (2) the 2017 drought in South Africa, and (3) the 2018 mid-winter drought in  Australia. During these three events, the SMAP-enhanced Palmer soil moisture  estimates (PM+SMAP) are compared against the Climate Hazards group Infrared  Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset and Normalized Difference  Vegetation Index (NDVI) products. Results demonstrate the benefit of assimilating  SMAP and confirm its potential for improving U.S. Department of  Agriculture-Foreign Agricultural Service root-zone soil moisture information  generated using the Palmer model. In particular, PM+SMAP soil moisture estimates  are shown to enhance the spatial variability of Palmer model root-zone soil  moisture estimates and adjust the Palmer model drought response to improve its  consistency with ancillary CHIRPS precipitation and NDVI information.},

	abstract = {Livestock husbandry has raised enormous environmental concerns around the world, including water quality issues. Yet there is a need to document long-term water  quality trends in livestock-intensive regions and reveal the drivers for the  trends based on detailed catchment monitoring. Here, we assessed the  concentration and load trends of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in  streamwater of a livestock-intensive catchment in southwestern Norway, based on  continuous flow measurements and flow-proportional composite water sampling.  Precipitation and catchment-level soil P balance were monitored to examine the  drivers. At the field level, moreover, the relationship between soil P balance  and soil test P (measured using the ammonium lactate extraction method, P-AL) was  assessed. Results showed that on average of 20 years 95 \% of the P was applied to  the catchment during March-August, when 40 \% of annual precipitation and 25 \% of  annual discharge occurred. The low runoff helped reduce P loss following P  applications. However, flow-weighted annual mean DRP concentration significantly  increased with increasingly cumulative soil P surplus (R(2) = 0.55, p = 0.0002).  With a mean annual P surplus of 8.8 kg ha(-1), the annual mean DRP concentration  (range: 49-140 μg L(-1); mean: 80 μg L(-1)) and annual DRP load (range:  0.35-1.46 kg ha(-1); mean: 0.65 kg ha(-1)) significantly increased over the  20-year monitoring period (p = 0.001 and 0.0003, respectively). At the field  level, P-AL concentrations were positively correlated with soil P balances  (R(2) = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.0001), confirming the long-term impact of P balances on the  risks of P loss. The study highlights the predominant role of long-term P  balances in affecting DRP loss in livestock-intensive regions through the effect  on soil test P.},

	abstract = {Ridge-furrow with full ﬁlm mulching has been widely applied to increase crop yield and water productivity on the Loess Plateau, but it may stimulate carbon  (C) mineralization. How to integrate other technological benefits based on this  technology for long-term maintenance of high yield and soil fertility is a  pressing issue. With the local farmers' practice (FP) as a control, three  integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM) practices integrating fertilizer  rates, fertilizer types and planting densities (ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN)  were established to improve maize yield and soil quality. Compared with the FP,  the maize yield increased by 13.34\%, 21.83\% and 30.24\%, and the soil quality  index (SQI) increased by 9.66\%, 14.91\% and 38.38\% for ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and  ISSM-MN, respectively. However, ISSM-N1 did not significantly increase yield, and  ISSM-N2 increased residual soil nitrate and decreased nitrogen (N) partial factor  productivity significantly. Compared to the FP, ISSM practices increased soil  organic carbon (SOC), labile organic C fractions (LOCFs) and potassium  permanganate organic C fractions in the topsoil to varying degrees, but only  ISSM-MN reached significant levels for most C fractions. The sensitivity index  indicated very easily oxidizable C (24.6\%), easily oxidizable C (24.7\%),  hot-water extractable C (30.8\%), labile organic C (24.7\%) and particulate organic  C (57.3\%) were more sensitive than SOC (22.7\%). ISSM-MN sequestered significantly  higher C than the other treatments. The results of the relative importance  analysis and the structural equation model indicated that LOCFs were the direct  contributors to yield, while recalcitrant C (C(O)) was the indirect contributor,  revealing the underlying mechanism that C(O) decomposed to replenish LOCFs and  the total N pool with the water soluble C pool as the transit station. Overall,  ISSM-MN is the most promising strategy to improve crop yield and soil fertility  in the long term on the Loess Plateau.},

Conventional cultivated soil, i.e., inorganic fertilization, tillage,  crop residue removal and maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture, and traditional organic  farmed soil "milpa," i.e., minimum tillage, rotation of maize, pumpkin (Cucurbita  sp.) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and organic fertilization were sampled.  Both soils from the central highlands of Mexico were characterized and incubated  aerobically at 5\% field capacity (5\%FC) and 100\% field capacity (FC) for 45 days,  while the C and N mineralization, enzyme activity and the bacterial community  structure were monitored. After applying the different agricultural practices 3  years, the organic C content was 1.8-times larger in the milpa than in the  conventional cultivated soil, the microbial biomass C 1.3-times, and C and N  mineralization 2.0-times (mean for soil incubated at 5\%FC and FC). The  dehydrogenase, activity was significantly higher in the conventional cultivated  soil than in the milpa soil when incubated at 5\%FC, but not when incubated at FC.  The relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes was larger in the conventional  cultivated soil than in the milpa soil in soil both at 5\%FC and FC, while that of  Bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend. The relative abundance of other groups,  such as Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria, was affected by cultivation technique,  but controlled by soil water content. The relative abundance of other groups,  e.g., FBP, Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria, was affected by water content,  but the effect depended on agricultural practice. For soil incubated at FC, the  xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism related functions were higher in the  milpa soil than in the conventional cultivated soil, and carbohydrate metabolism  showed an opposite trend. It was found that agricultural practices and soil water  content had a strong effect on soil characteristics, C and N mineralization,  enzyme activity, and the bacterial community structure and its functionality.  Decreases or increases in the relative abundance of bacterial groups when the  soil water content decreased, i.e., from FC to 5\%FC, was defined often by the  cultivation technique, and the larger organic matter content in the milpa soil  did not prevent large changes in the bacterial community structure when the soil  was dried.},

	abstract = {Efficient water use assessment and irrigation management is critical for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, especially under changing climate  conditions. Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over  wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale  mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource  applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework  for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture  radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT)  model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil  moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies.  Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface  soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT  model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy  of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and  real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is  superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship  between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such  as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and  states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model.  Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model  are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals,  suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural  sub-field scale using a data assimilation strategy.},

In this study, we propose a new downscaling approach, named  integrated passive and active downscaling (I-PAD), to achieve high spatial and  temporal resolution soil moisture datasets over regions without detailed soil  data. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Phased Array-type  L-band SAR (PALSAR) data are combined through a dual-pass land data assimilation  system to obtain soil moisture at 1 km resolution. In the first step, fine  resolution model parameters are optimized based on fine resolution PALSAR soil  moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area  index data, and coarse resolution AMSR-E brightness temperature data. Then, the  25 km AMSR-E observations are assimilated into a land surface model at 1 km  resolution with a simple but computationally low-cost algorithm that considers  the spatial resolution difference. Precipitation data are used as the only inputs  from ground measurements. The evaluations at the two lightly vegetated sites in  Mongolia and the Little Washita basin show that the time series of soil moisture  are improved at most of the observation by the assimilation scheme. The analyses  reveal that I-PAD can capture overall spatial trends of soil moisture within the  coarse resolution radiometer footprints, demonstrating the potential of the  algorithm to be applied over data-sparse regions. The capability and limitation  are discussed based on the simple optimization and assimilation schemes used in  the algorithm.},

	abstract = {The depletion of water resources has gained global attention, particularly in arid climates, where there is growing interest in reusing treated wastewater for  irrigation. This study focuses on the impact of irrigating treated wastewater  using a hybrid multi-soil-layering (MSL) technology on soil physicochemical  properties and the agro-physiological characteristics of maize (Zea mays)  cultivated in Morocco, a region characterized by arid conditions. To achieve this  research goals, three plots were cultivated with Zea mays and subjected to  irrigation with water of varying qualities: raw wastewater (RWW), treated  wastewater (TWW), and well water (WW). This experiment ran for five months,  covering one crop season. The physicochemical and microbiological parameters in  the soil and water were investigated, and the agro-physiological characteristics  of the maize crops were assessed. The findings revealed significant differences  in physicochemical and microbial parameters within both water and soil, as well  as in the physiological responses of the maize crop, among the three water  treatments. TWW's quality met the permissible limits for direct wastewater  discharge, as prescribed by Moroccan norms, making it suitable for potential  irrigation reuse. Moreover, the higher content of key elements (Na, K, Ca, and  Mg) in WW indicated that TWW was more suitable for irrigation. Zea mays irrigated  with RWW and TWW exhibited a higher accumulation of protein and sugar content  compared to WW irrigation. Furthermore, the biomass parameters, including root,  aerial, and grain dry weight, showed a positive effect on Zea mays irrigated with  RWW and TWW compared to WW. Total chlorophyll content, on the other hand, was  highest in plants irrigated with WW, followed by TWW. Plants irrigated with RWW  produced the highest amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Conversely,  plants irrigated with WW had a higher content of Ca, Na, and Mg. TWW yielded  medium concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na compared to RWW and WW,  attributed to the nutrients provided by irrigation with TWW using the hybrid MSL  technology. In conclusion, aside from their use as irrigation water, treated  wastewater emerges as a valuable source of plant nutrients and soil fertilizers.  They offer significant nutritive value, enhancing plant growth, reducing the need  for additional fertilizer application, lowering mineral fertilization costs, and  increasing the productivity of infertile soils. This highlights the potential of  treated wastewater to improve agricultural sustainability in arid regions like  Morocco.},

	abstract = {The sustainable use of grasslands in intensive farming systems aims to optimize nitrogen (N) inputs to increase crop yields and decrease harmful losses to the  environment at the same time. To achieve this, simple optical sensors may provide  a non-destructive, time- and cost-effective tool for estimating plant biomass in  the field, considering spatial and temporal variability. However, the plant  growth and related N uptake is affected by the available N in the soil, and  therefore, N mineralization and N losses. These soil N dynamics and N losses are  affected by the N input and environmental conditions, and cannot easily be  determined non-destructively. Therefore, the question arises: whether a  relationship can be depicted between N fertilizer levels, plant biomass and N  dynamics as indicated by nitrous oxide (N₂O) losses and inorganic N levels. We  conducted a standardized greenhouse experiment to explore the potential of  spectral measurements for analyzing yield response, N mineralization and N₂O  emissions in a permanent grassland. Ryegrass was subjected to four mineral  fertilizer input levels over 100 days (four harvests) under controlled  environmental conditions. The soil temperature and moisture content were  automatically monitored, and the emission rates of N₂O and carbon dioxide (CO₂)  were detected frequently. Spectral measurements of the swards were performed  directly before harvesting. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and  simple ratio (SR) were moderately correlated with an increasing biomass as  affected by fertilization level. Furthermore, we found a non-linear response of  increasing N₂O emissions to elevated fertilizer levels. Moreover, inorganic N and  extractable organic N levels at the end of the experiment tended to increase with  the increasing N fertilizer addition. However, microbial biomass C and CO₂ efflux  showed no significant differences among fertilizer treatments, reflecting no  substantial changes in the soil biological pool size and the extent of the C  mineralization. Neither the NDVI nor SR, nor the plant biomass, were related to  cumulative N₂O emissions or inorganic N at harvesting. Our results verify the  usefulness of optical sensors for biomass detection, and show the difficulty in  linking spectral measurements of plant traits to N processes in the soil, despite  that the latter affects the former.},

The cost of instrumentation, however, limits  measurement frequency and number of sensors. The objective of this work was to  design a low cost "open hardware" platform for multi-sensor measurements  including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The  system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a  simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency  dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline  soils (ECe1: 2.5 {\textless} 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to  cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error  (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil,  0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled  soil data) fitted the data very well (R2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being  able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation  (RMSE(training) = 2.63; RMSE(validation) = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were  automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality  checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a  customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby  sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and  continuous improvement of existing technologies.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and  redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape can  determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of this research  was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor, sediment delivery and SOC in a  sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six pedons were studied along the slope by  digging 6 pits up to 60cm depth. Soil was sampled every 10cm and SOC, water  extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were  analyzed. Erosion rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the  pole height method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of  vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived  from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared with measured  pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion, sediment redistribution and  SOC across the slope was strongly affected by topographic features, slope and  curvature. The erosion rate was 16Mgha(-1)y(-1) since the time of planting  (6years). SOC redistribution was strongly correlated with the detachment or  deposition areas as highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC  loss over six years amounted to 1.2MgCha(-1). SUVA(254) values, which indicate  hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased  significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment site is  more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor was strongly  correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated that high resolution  passive remote sensing data combined with soil and plant analyses can survey  areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility, soil erosion and plant vigor. This  will allow monitoring of soil erosion and degradation risk areas and support  decision-makers in developing measures for friendly environmental management.},

	abstract = {Recently, emphasis has been placed on finding a reliable estimation of soil water content. In this study, two capacitance sensors EC5 and 5TE (METER Group) were  utilized. These sensors provide many benefits relative to other sensors in that  they are cost-effective and very economical regarding energy use, operate at a  high measurement frequency of 70 MHz, and are dedicated to measuring at a small  volume because of their small size. This makes them suitable for the context of  use in this research, which consists of multiple sustainable drainage systems  SuDS. Several studies have evaluated these two types of sensor but not for urban  soils with specific characteristics. In addition, results from the literature are  divergent and the published calibration data are limited. Therefore, an in-depth  investigation of their accuracy is assessed in this paper. At first, the  literature's existing procedures and methods were examined. The sensor-to-sensor  variability, as well as repeatability, were tested in soil and solutions.  Additionally, a field calibration method was conducted to estimate the effects of  soil texture on sensors readings. Two laboratory calibration methods having  different principles were also applied, compared to each other and to the field  calibration as well. Results revealed weak sensor-to-sensor variability  (coefficient of variation up to 15\% in soil) and also good repeatability (0.1\%),  for both sensors. A soil-specific calibration equation has improved the  estimation of the volumetric water content. In case of soil having high field  bulk density, the undisturbed soil calibration method described and proposed in  this paper gives promising results. The latter method yields a volumetric water  content (VWC) prediction accuracy of 0.025 m(3)∙m(-3) on a sandy loam soil. This  paper presents a large knowledge of capacitance sensors measurement technique as  well as their calibration procedures and methods. Limitations of existing  procedures have been identified and key elements for selecting the appropriate  one are suggested. Derived calibration equations have also been provided for  three urban soils with different particle size distribution, ranging from sandy  loam to silt loam. Accurate monitoring of soil moisture content in urban soils is  thus achievable.},

The  Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two decades to simulate  hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport; however, spatial limitations of  the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale representation of phosphorus (P) losses.  Rather, the WSM relies on literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss  (targets) for simulated land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool,  Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the  current WSM approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil  properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from the WSM  were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss estimates resulted in  greater estimated total P loss and a revised spatial pattern of P loss compared  with the WSM's original targets. Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P  loss were substituted into the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration  performance at up to 79\% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of  APLE into the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of  field management on Chesapeake Bay water quality.},

Water deficit conditions are one of the major factors that  affect the development of root system architecture (RSA) and consequently, crop  productivity, and yet, due to its long maturity periods and bulky storage root  systems, RSA studies in cassava are uncommon. The objective of this study was to  identify traits that are responsible for the variability and plastic responses of  cassava in response to drought at the juvenile stage of growth. Eight cassava  genotypes were grown in soil-filled pots under well-watered and droughted  conditions for up to 45 days and multivariate analyses employed to determine the  major contributory traits to variability and the relative distance plasticity  index (RDPI) was computed to evaluate plasticity. There were significant  genotypic variations for most of the traits measured. Drought generally inhibited  root production and development and the degree of inhibition was between 2 and  22\%. Regardless of the soil moisture condition, traits which differentiated the  RSA included root biomass, root numbers, root branching density, and total root  length, and these were also the important contributory traits to variability  under well-watered soil conditions. Important contributory traits to variability  traits under drought were shoot-related traits such as leaf area and shoot  biomass, and also root system traits such as nodal root number, root biomass,  diameter and branching density. Phenotypic plasticity was found in most traits  where the number, branching density and diameter of upper nodal roots presented  the highest RDPI. These traits corresponded with the traits contributing greatly  to variation. Plastic responses of cassava to drought were dependent on trait and  genotype. It is concluded that upper nodal roots-related traits could have  importance in breeding cassava to better tolerate water deficit conditions. The  secondary growth and ability to maintain or increase the upper nodal root count  or density under limited soil moisture may be related to good growth and yield  performance of cassava under drought conditions. Upper nodal roots could be used  to screen and select cassava genotypes adapted to drought at the juvenile stage  but as a potential indirect selection strategy, the persistence and pertinence of  these traits and their relationship with yield and yield components under drought  conditions in the field must be confirmed.},

However, neglecting ecological  knowledge about species, e.g. their seasonal movements, and ignoring the proper  environmental factors that can explain key elements for species survival  (shelter, food and water) increase model uncertainty. This study exemplifies how  these ecological gaps in species distribution modeling can be addressed by  modeling the distribution of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in Australia.  Emus cover a large area during the austral winter. However, their habitat shrinks  during the summer months. We show evidence of emu summer habitat shrinkage due to  higher fire frequency, and low water and food availability in northern regions.  Our findings indicate that emus prefer areas with higher vegetation productivity  and low fire recurrence, while their distribution is linked to an optimal  intermediate ({\textasciitilde}0.12 m3 m(-3)) soil moisture range. We propose that the  application of three geospatial data products derived from satellite remote  sensing, namely fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, and soil water content,  provides an effective representation of emu general habitat requirements, and  substantially improves species distribution modeling and representation of the  species' ecological habitat niche across Australia.},

	abstract = {The water balance equation (WBE) describes how net water inflows into a system relate to storage changes over a time span (dt). This equation is fundamental in  hydrologic studies, helping to determine water supply and elucidate the  terrestrial water cycle. For land surface, the WBE links water fluxes like  precipitation (P), evapotranspiration, drainage and surface runoff to soil  moisture (SM) changes within a discrete soil layer (dSM). While traditional focus  has been on the precision of the WBE-estimated fluxes, there has been increased  recent interest in fitting the WBE using remotely-sensed P and SM data to infer  water balance parameters, particularly the ΔZ that associates net fluxes and dSM  within dt. However, obtaining physically interpretable WBE parameters like ΔZ is  a potentially ill-posed problem due to simplifying assumptions imbedded in a WBE  implementation, missing hydrologic constraints, and accuracy and revisit  limitations in available remotely-sensed data. In addition, WBE parameters  obtained from classical maximum likelihood estimation approaches can vary  significantly. Here, using a Bayesian non-linear modeling approach, we  demonstrate how these factors can impede the identification of useful ΔZ  estimates. Specifically, we find that ΔZ estimates are likely to be spuriously  biased due to limitations in the temporal resolution and accuracy of  satellite-based dSM estimates - as well as the neglect of other hydrological  components in the WBE. Maps showcasing the lower and upper bounds of the 94 \% HDI  from our Bayesian model further elucidate these biases. Results suggests that  estimates of ΔZ are effective in nature and great care should be exercised when  attempting to interpret them physically. Instead, they should be defined as  effective parameters reflecting the characteristics of their fitted  remotely-sensed data sets. Drawing from current progress, accurate ΔZ estimates,  informed by more advanced remote sensing techniques and precise WBE, will enhance  our understanding of terrestrial water cycle.},

Application of  controlled-release urea (CRU) is considered as an effective N fertilizer practice  for improving crop yields and NUE. Here, field experiments were conducted during  2015-2017 to assess the effects of two CRUs (resin-coated urea (RCU) and  polyurethane-coated urea (PCU)) on rice yields, NUE and soil fertility at two  sites (Lincheng town (LC) and Xintang town (XT)). Four treatments were  established at each site: (1) control with no N application (CK), (2) split  application of conventional urea (U, 270 kg N ha(-1)), (3) single basal  application of RCU (RCU, 216 kg N ha(-1)), and (4) single basal application of  PCU (PCU, 216 kg N ha(-1)). The N application rate in the CRU treatment compared  to the U treatment was reduced by 20\%. However, the results showed that, compared  to split application of urea, single basal application of CRU led to similar rice  grain yields and aboveground biomass at both sites. No significant difference in  the N uptake by rice plant was observed between the U and CRU treatments at  either site. There were no significant differences in the N apparent recovery  efficiency (NARE) among the U, RCU and PCU treatments, with the exception of that  in XT in 2015. Compared to application of U, application of CRU increased the N  agronomic efficiency (NAE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP) by 17.4-52.6\%  and 23.4-29.8\% at the LC site, and 15.0-84.1\% and 23.2-33.4\% at the XT site,  respectively, during 2015-2017. Yield component analysis revealed that greater  rice grain yield in response to N fertilizer was attributed mainly to the number  of panicles per m(2), which increased in the fertilized treatments compared to  the CK treatment. The application of CRU did not affect the soil fertility after  rice harvest in 2016. Overall, these results suggest that single basal  application of CRU constitutes a promising alternative N management practice for  reducing N application rates, time- and labor-consuming in rice production in  southeast China.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The depth of fertilizer application significantly influences soil nitrate concentration (SNC), sunflower root length density (RLD), sunflower  nitrogen uptake (SNU), and yield. However, current studies cannot precisely  capture subtle nutrient variations between soil layers and their complex  relationships with root growth. They also struggle to assess the impact of  different fertilizer application depths on sunflower root development and  distribution as well as their response to the spatial and temporal distribution  of nutrients. METHODS: The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)  model was employed to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen  distribution in the soil at three controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) placement  depths: 5, 15, and 25 cm. This study investigated the characteristics of the root  system regarding nitrogen absorption and utilization and analyzed their  correlation with sunflower yield formation. Furthermore, this study introduced  the modified Jaccard index (considering the compatibility between soil nitrate  and root length density) to analyze soil-root interactions, providing a deeper  insight into how changes in CRF placement depth affect crop growth and nitrogen  uptake efficiency. RESULTS: The results indicated that a fertilization depth of  15 cm improved the modified Jaccard index by 6.60\% and 7.34\% compared to 5 cm and  25 cm depths, respectively, maximizing sunflower yield (an increase of 9.44\%) and  nitrogen absorption rate (an increase of 5.40\%). This depth promoted a greater  Root Length Density (RLD), with an increases of 11.95\% and 16.42\% compared those  at 5 cm and 25 cm, respectively, enhancing deeper root growth and improving  nitrogen uptake. In contrast, shallow fertilization led to higher nitrate  concentrations in the topsoil, whereas deeper fertilization increased the nitrate  concentrations in the deeper soil layers. DISCUSSION: These results provide  valuable insights for precision agriculture and sustainable soil management,  highlighting the importance of optimizing root nitrogen absorption through  tailored fertilization strategies to enhance crop production efficiency and  minimize environmental impact.},

Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we  quantified pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional  hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to wild (Raphanus raphanistrum)  radish populations. Both radish species were grown together in relatively dry (no  rain), relatively wet (double rain), or control soil moisture conditions in Ohio,  USA. We measured wild and crop radish life-history, phenology and pollinator  visitation patterns. To quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species,  we used a simply inherited morphological marker to detect F1 hybrid progeny.  Although crop-to-wild hybridization did not respond to watering treatments, the  abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the period of  phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal numbers of open  flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and its relationship to  flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid zone formation in Raphanus spp.  than soil moisture or pollen vector movements.},

There were no effects of N fertilization on  soil phosphatase activity, electrical conductivity, or concentrations of  water-soluble P. Concentrations of extractable P decreased in plots receiving  50N, but increasing N fertilization to 100N resulted in no further reduction in  extractable P. Forage biomass, foliar P concentrations, and forage P mass were  not affected by N fertilization rates at the plant-community level, but responses  were observed within individual forage species. Results are interpreted to mean  that N fertilization at 50\% of the agronomic recommendation for the grass  component can increase forage P mass of specific forages and decrease soil  extractable P, thus providing opportunity for decreasing P losses from grazed  pasture.},

Since the majority of these landslides occur  during prolonged wet conditions, or intense rainstorms, moisture conditions are a  critical control. The nature, dynamics, and character of soil moisture  conditions, and the piezometric response to rainfall, have been recorded within  an 'incipient' landslide for more than 5 years. The study site, on pastoral hill  country within the Lake Tutira catchment in northern Hawkes Bay, is typical of  large areas of New Zealand episodically affected by extensive landsliding.  Detailed continuous measurements show that both the soil moisture and piezometric  response within the regolith are highly storm- and site-specific. The development  of positive pore pressures is infrequent; they form only during intense  rainstorms, and persist for a short time. The hydraulic response of the soil is  primarily a function of storm characteristics, but this response can be modified  by antecedent moisture conditions, topographic position, and heterogeneity of  soil properties. Stability analysis shows that most slopes in the study area are  significantly steeper than can be explained by the frictional strength of the  regolith. Measured hydraulic conditions also show that positive pore-water  pressures alone do not trigger slope instability. A recent slope failure followed  a period of extremely high antecedent moisture conditions, and occurred when  maximum soil moisture conditions, though not pore-water pressures, were recorded.  Increased moisture content of the regolith reduces matric tension, and therefore  effective cohesion of the soil. This cohesion is critical to maintaining  stability of the regolith on these slopes.},

A  non-invasive tool based on electromagnetic wave transmittance in the microwave  frequency range, operating close to 4.8 GHz, was developed using microstrip patch  antennas to determine the volumetric moisture of soil in rhizoboxes. Antennas  were placed on both sides of the rhizobox and, using a vector network analyzer,  measured the S parameters. The dispersion parameter S(21) (dB) was also used to  show the effect of different soil types and temperature on the measurement. In  addition, system sensitivity, reproducibility and repeatability were evaluated.  The quantitative results of the soil moisture, measured in rhizoboxes, presented  in this paper, demonstrate that the microwave technique using microstrip patch  antennas is a reliable, non-invasive and accurate system, and has shown  potentially promising applications for measurement of rhizobox-based root  phenotyping.},

	abstract = {The effects of insect defoliators on throughfall and soil nutrient fluxes were studied in coniferous and deciduous stands at five UK intensive monitoring plots  (1998 to 2008). Links were found between the dissolved organic carbon (DOC),  nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fluxes through the forest system to biological  activity within the canopy. Underlying soil type determined the leaching or  accumulation of these elements. Under oak, monitored at two sites, frass from  caterpillars of Tortrix viridana and Operophtera brumata added direct deposition  of {\textasciitilde}16kgha(-1)extra N during defoliation. Peaks of nitrate (NO(3)-N) flux between  5 and 9kgha(-1) (×5 usual winter values) were recorded in consecutive years in  shallow soil waters. Synchronous rises in deep soil NO(3)-N fluxes at the  Grizedale sandy site indicate downward flushing, not seen at the clay site. Under  three Sitka spruce stands, generation of honeydew (DOC) was attributed to two  aphid species (Elatobium abietinum and Cinara pilicornis) with distinctive  feeding strategies. Throughfall DOC showed mean annual fluxes (6 seasons)  {\textasciitilde}45-60kgha(-1) compared with rainfall values of 14-22kgha(-1). Increases of total  N in throughfall and NO(3)-N fluxes in shallow soil solution were detected - soil  water fluxes reached 8kgha(-1) in Llyn Brianne, {\textasciitilde}25kgha(-1) in Tummel, and {\textasciitilde}40kg  NO(3)-Nha(-1) in Coalburn. At Tummel, on sandy soil, NO(3)-N leaching showed  increased concentration at depth, attributed to microbiological activity within  the soil. By contrast, at Coalburn and Llyn Brianne, sites on peaty gleys, soil  water NO(3)-N was retained mostly within the humus layer. Soil type is thus key  to predicting N movement and retention patterns. These long term analyses show  important direct and indirect effects of phytophagous insects in forest  ecosystems, on above and below ground processes affecting tree growth, soil  condition, vegetation and water quality.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates estimation of root zone soil moisture using two passive microwave remote sensing datasets, Advanced Microwave Scattering Radiometer - 2  and Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites sensors. The study is focused on two  crops, namely rice and wheat for the Indo-Gangetic basin, India, having a dynamic  crop and soil type and land use land cover. A total of 21 rice crop and 23 wheat  crop locations are chosen from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and  Bihar falling in the basin. The root zone soil moisture information is derived by  estimating soil wetness index from surface soil moisture at 10 and 40 cm depths  using a recursive exponential filter. The soil wetness index based algorithm is  implementable even in the absence of ground information for a basin level study.  The reference soil moisture dataset is obtained from the Global Land Database  Assimilation System - NOAH at 10 and 40 cm depth. The research has also  demonstrated significant potential of GLDAS-NOAH soil moisture data in the  absence of ground (in-situ) soil moisture data. Of the various factors affecting  surface and root zone soil moisture, this work evaluates the control of soil  constituents on root zone soil moisture. The Spearman rank correlation  coefficient is estimated for characteristic time delay with sand, silt and clay  percentage at different locations. Coupling between and trends of surface and  root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crop locations are studied. The  accuracy of estimated soil wetness index at 10 and 40 cm from two different  satellite sensors at two different acquisition times (ascending and descending  passes) is investigated by calculating the coefficient of determination, mean  absolute error and mean biased error. This work highlights the significant  difference in surface soil moisture estimation by two satellite sensors to derive  root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crops. Coefficient of determination is  more (∼0.9) for SMAP derived soil wetness index whereas it is lower (∼0.65) for  AMSR-2 derived soil wetness index for both crops. Characteristic time delay  variation is observed at two different times and at both the depths, with  characteristic time delay increasing with depth. Also, at the descending pass  characteristic time delay is lower as compared to the ascending pass. A strong  relationship between root zone soil moisture and soil texture is observed. For  rice crop, a positive correlation with sand and clay is observed for Uttar  Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar locations having loam and sandy loam as the  major soil class. And, for wheat locations, a positive correlation is observed  for silt and clay for Uttar Pradesh locations and sand for Madhya Pradesh  locations having loam and clay (light) soil texture. This work delivers essential  information in understanding sustainable irrigation scheduling and increasing  irrigation potential for rice and wheat crop locations. Having the knowledge of  all the factors influencing crop cultivation and the derived root zone soil  moisture, crop production can be optimized.},

Agronomic improvement requires knowledge of whole-plant phenotypes expressed in response to  simultaneous variation in these essential resources. Most phenotypes, however,  have been described from experiments where resources are varied singularly. To  test the importance of varying shoot and root resources for phenotyping studies,  sister pre-breeding lines of wheat were phenotyped in response to independent or  simultaneous exposure to two light levels and soil moisture profiles. The  distribution and architecture of the root systems depended strongly on the  moisture of the deeper soil layer. For one genotype, roots, specifically lateral  roots, were stimulated to grow into moist soil when the upper zone was  well-watered and were inhibited by drier deep zones. In contrast, the other  genotype showed much less plasticity and responsiveness to upper moist soil, but  maintained deeper penetration of roots into the dry layer. The sum of shoot and  root responses was greater when treated simultaneously to low light and low soil  water, compared to each treatment alone, suggesting the value of whole plant  phenotyping in response to multiple conditions for agronomic improvement. The  results suggest that canopy management for increased irradiation of leaves would  encourage root growth into deeper drier soil, and that genetic variation within  closely related breeding lines may exist to favour surface root growth in  response to irrigation or in-season rainfall.},

This study developed an  Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the aid of remote sensing images. The  underlying idea is to extend the traditional Kriging by introducing spectral  variables, and operating on spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm  has been applied to WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to  generate daily maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three  traditional Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN  data only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data as  covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended Kriging  shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED. The Root Mean  Square Error (RMSE) of Extended Kriging was found to be the smallest among the  four interpolation results. This indicates that the proposed method has  advantages in combining remote sensing information and ground measurements in  soil moisture interpolation.},

In this study, a  process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a  simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data  to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N  emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting  reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical  relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen  movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes  nitrification, denitrification and ammonia (NH(3)) volatilization. SPOT-5 and  Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information  and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the  model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate  the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in  situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil  temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to  verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of  R(2)=0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to  the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10m) of  the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the  most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the  main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the  aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial  structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area  should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland  ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.},

Land managers and  environmental regulators need simple cost effective techniques for identifying  soil - land use combinations in which preferential flow occurs. Existing  techniques for identifying preferential flow have a range of limitations  including; often being destructive, non in situ, small sampling volumes, or are  subject to artificial boundary conditions. This study demonstrated that high  frequency soil moisture monitoring using a multi-sensory capacitance probe  mounted within a vertically rammed access tube, was able to determine the  occurrence, depth, and wetting front velocity of preferential flow events  following rainfall. Occurrence of preferential flow was not related to either  rainfall intensity or rainfall amount, rather preferential flow occurred when  antecedent soil moisture content was below 226 mm soil moisture storage (0-70  cm). Results indicate that high temporal frequency soil moisture monitoring may  be used to identify soil type - land use combinations in which the presence of  preferential flow increases the risk of shallow groundwater contamination by  rapid transport of agrochemicals through the soil profile. However use of high  frequency based soil moisture monitoring to determine agrochemical mobilisation  risk may be limited by, inability to determine the volume of preferential flow,  difficulty observing macropore flow at high antecedent soil moisture content, and  creation of artificial voids during installation of access tubes in stony soils.},

These soils are unsuitable for conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems  (OWTS) which are nevertheless widely used in this region. In order to provide an  alternative wastewater dosing system, an experimental field moisture controlled  subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system was designed and installed as a field  trial. The experimental system that integrates a seasonal cropping system was  evaluated for two years on a 500-m(2) Houston clay site in west central Alabama  from August 2006 to June 2008. The SDI system was designed to start hydraulic  dosing only when field moisture was below field capacity. Hydraulic dosing rates  fluctuated as expected with higher dosing rates during warm seasons with near  zero or zero dosing rates during cold seasons. Lower hydraulic dosing in winter  creates the need for at least a two-month waste storage structure which is an  insurmountable challenge for rural homeowners. An estimated 30\% of dosed water  percolated below 45-cm depth during the first summer which included a 30-year  historic drought. This massive volume of percolation was presumably the result of  preferential flow stimulated by dry weather clay soil cracking. Although water  percolation is necessary for OWTS, this massive water percolation loss indicated  that this experimental system is not able to effective control soil moisture  within its monitoring zone as designed. Overall findings of this study indicated  that soil moisture controlled SDI wastewater dosing is not suitable as a  standalone system in these Vertisols. However, the experimental soil moisture  control system functioned as designed, demonstrating that soil moisture  controlled SDI wastewater dosing may find application as a supplement to other  wastewater disposal methods that can function during cold seasons.},

To read the sensor, we use a circuit that includes a 10 kHz triangle  wave generator, an AC amplifier, a precision rectifier and a microcontroller. In  terms of performance, the sensor's capacitance (measured in a laboratory  prototype) increases up to 5\% when the volumetric water content of the porous  ceramic changed from 3\% to 36\%, resulting in a sensitivity of S = 15.5 pF per  unity change. Repeatability tests for capacitance measurement showed that the θ v  sensor's root mean square error is 0.13\%. The average current consumption of the  system (sensor and signal conditioning circuit) is less than 1.5 μ A, which  demonstrates its suitability for being powered by energy harvesting systems. We  developed a complete irrigation control system that integrates the sensor, an  energy harvesting module composed of a microgenerator installed on the top of a  micro sprinkler spinner, and a DC/DC converter circuit that charges a 1 F  supercapacitor. The energy harvesting module operates only when the micro  sprinkler spinner is irrigating the soil, and the supercapacitor is fully charged  to 5 V in about 3 h during the first irrigation. After the first irrigation, with  the supercap fully charged, the system can operate powered only by the  supercapacitor for approximately 23 days, without any energy being harvested.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of active infrared thermography and thermometry in combination with multivariate statistical partial  least squares analysis as rapid soil water content detection techniques both in  the laboratory and the field. Such techniques allow fast soil water content  measurements helpful in both agricultural and environmental fields. These  techniques, based on the theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly  measuring temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the  assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during three  intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific heats  differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated using slopes to  linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the best model was achieved for  a 10 s slope. Three different approaches were considered, two in the laboratory  and one in the field. The first laboratory-based one was centred on active  infrared thermography, considered measurement of temperature variation as  independent variable and reported r = 0.74. The second laboratory-based one was  focused on active infrared thermometry, added irradiation as independent variable  and reported r = 0.76. The in-field experiment was performed by active infrared  thermometry, heating bare soil by solar irradiance after exposure due to primary  tillage. Some meteorological parameters were inserted as independent variables in  the prediction model, which presented r = 0.61. In order to obtain more general  and wide estimations in-field a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis on  three classes of percentage of soil water content was performed obtaining a high  correct classification in the test (88.89\%). The prediction error values were  lower in the field with respect to laboratory analyses. Both techniques could be  used in conjunction with a Geographic Information System for obtaining detailed  information on soil heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture factor is one of the important parameters in the study of wind and sand fixation functions of ecosystems. Traditional methods often use potential  evaporation, rainfall, and irrigation observed by meteorological stations to  estimate soil moisture, which has significant limitations in terms of spatial  continuity and data availability. Based on the development of remote sensing  technology in soil moisture detection, we selected four remote sen-sing  indicators for soil moisture (MODIS evapotranspiration ratio method, SMAP soil  moisture ratio method, visible shortwave infrared drought index method, and  remote sensing humidity index method) to improve the estimation of soil moisture  factor in the modified wind erosion equation model (RWEQ), and used the improved  algorithm to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of wind  prevention and sand fixation services in the northwest region of Liaoning  Province from 2001 to 2021. The results showed that the MODIS evapotranspiration  ratio method had the highest correlation with traditional meteorological methods  in calculating soil moisture. The formula obtained by fitting the two could be  used to improve the calculation of soil moisture factor in the RWEQ model. From  2001 to 2021, the wind prevention and sand fixation capacity in the northwest  region of Liaoning Province showed strong spatial distribution characteristics in  the northern and eastern regions, while weak in the central and western regions.  According to Mann-Kendall trend testing, 72.7\% of the regions in northwest  Liaoning Province were showing an upward trend in their ability to prevent wind  and fix sand. The application of geographic detector models for driving factor  analysis showed that the change in wind and sand fixation capacity was a process  of multiple factors interacting with each other, greatly influenced by soil type,  annual wind speed, and economic development level. Moreover, the interaction  between various driving factors had a higher impact on wind and sand fixation  than that of single factors. The results could improve the RWEQ model estimation  and provide technical support for the long-term analysis of ecological function  formation mechanisms and driving forces in the northwest region of Liaoning.},

	abstract = {As a novel remote sensing technique, polarimetric detecting technology is a useful supplement to traditional hyperspectral remote sensing technology, which  provides more information for remote sensing. By taking advantage of the  polarization characteristics of the surface reflecting light of soil with  different moisture, the polarization spectral method is applied to measure soil  moisture. The spectropolarimeter was used to measure the polarized reflectance  spectrum of different soil moisture. The correlation between soil moisture and  polarization spectrum was analyzed. The polarization characteristics of soil  surface reflecting light in different viewing angles were surveyed by  experiments. The experimental results show that: in the higher soil moisture  conditions, the polarization spectrum and soil moisture have a certain  connection, especially in the 500～700 nm band and soil moisture is directly  proportional to the degree of polarization; but in low soil moisture conditions,  the correlation of polarization spectrum and soil moisture is not obvious; in  addition, the polarization spectrum are influenced by viewing angles, for  example, when the incident angle of source light is fixed at 50°, while the  viewing angle of instrument is between 20° and 60°, the degree of polarization  increases with the viewing angle. When the viewing angle becomes wider,, the  degree of polarization changed more significantly with the soil moisture.},

In this study, four previously developed mtlD transgenic  (T) peanut lines were used for detailed characterization under DS, at the  reproductive stage using lysimeter system under controlled greenhouse conditions.  In dry-down experiments, T lines maintained better photosynthetic machinery, such  as, photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and SPAD  (Soil-Plant Analyses Development) values, and had lower oxidative damage,  including lipid membrane peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide and superoxide  radical accumulation than WT, when exposed to 24 days of DS. WT plants had a more  negative water potential (WP; up to -3.22 MPa) than T lines did (-2.56 to -2.71  MPa) at day 24 of DS treatment. During recovery, T lines recovered easily whereas  67\% of WT plants failed to recover. In T lines, the rate of photosynthesis  strongly and positively correlated with the transpiration rate (r = 0.92), RWC (r  = 0.90), WP (r = 0.86), and total chlorophyll content (r = 0.75), suggesting its  strong correlation with water retention-related parameters. Furthermore, yield  parameters such as, pod weight and harvest index of T lines were up to 2.19 and  1.38 times more than those of WT plants, respectively. Thus, the significantly  better performance of mtlD T peanut lines than of WT plants under DS could be  attributed to the accumulation of mannitol, which in turn helped in maintaining  the osmoregulation and ROS scavenging activity of mannitol and ultimately  conferred water-economizing capacity and higher yield in T lines than in WT  plants.},

We used numerical  experiments to highlight the role of the 'Brown Ocean' effect (where saturated  soils function similar to a warm ocean surface) on intensification and it's  modulation by land cover change. A numerical modeling experiment that  successfully captured the flood event (control) was modified to alter moisture  availability by converting wetlands to open water, wet croplands, and dry  croplands. Storm evolution in the control experiment with wet antecedent soils  most resembles tropical lows that form and intensify over oceans. Irrespective of  soil moisture conditions, conversion of wetlands to croplands reduced storm  intensity, and also, non-saturated soils reduced rain by 20\% and caused shorter  durations of high intensity wind conditions. Developing agricultural croplands  and more so restoring wetlands and not converting them into open water can impede  intensification of tropical systems that affect the area.},

The  seedcotton yield and fiber quality with respect to fruiting position under ICMS  and CCMS were investigated in 2012 and 2013 in two fields differing in soil  fertility. Reduced bolls on fruiting branches 1-10 (FB(1-10)) and at fruiting  position 1-2 (FP(1-2)) on FB(11-15) could not be fully compensated by increased  bolls on FB(16+) under CCMS, resulting in more seedcotton yield under ICMS  relative to that under CCMS. Fiber at majority fruiting positions under CCMS were  longer and stronger than those under ICMS, but CCMS increased the contribution of  bolls on FB(11+) to the cotton yield, which overall resulted in no significant  change in fiber length and strength by management system at field level. The  number of bolls at FP(1-2) on FB(1-5) under CCMS while the number of bolls on  FB(1-5) and at FP(1-2) on FB(1-5) were not significantly changed by soil  fertility, resulting in diminished yield difference in soil fertility among ICMS  relative to that of CCMS. The high soil fertility significantly increased  seedcotton yield relative to low soil fertility, which was attributed to more  number of bolls on FB(11+) and higher seedcotton weight per boll at all fruiting  positions. High soil fertility field not only recorded superior fiber quality on  FB(11+), but also increased the contribution of these bolls to the cotton yield  relative to those in the low soil fertility field, resulting in no significant  change in overall fiber quality among soil fertility. These findings demonstrate  that by combining optimal management practices on infertile soils ICMS could  minimize the yield differences due to soil fertility without sacrificing fiber  quality.},

	abstract = {Environmental factors greatly influence grape quality. Among them, the effect of within-vineyard variability of soil in relation to soil moisture on table grape  under protected condition has rarely been studied. In this present research, we  investigated the influence of soil variability, in relation with soil moisture on  chlorophyll fluorescence, yield and quality attributes of the "Summer Black"  (Vitis vinifera L. × V. labruscana L.) table grape, popularly grown under double  cropping system in protected covering in the southern part of China. The vineyard  was divided vertically into three sites (lower, middle and upper, 192, 202 and  212 m above sea level, respectively) and data on soil moisture and other yield  and quality parameters were recorded. Among the three vineyard sites, middle site  resulted in higher yield compared to the upper and lower sites during winter and  summer cropping cycles. However, compared to regular summer cycle, winter cycle  provided grapevines with higher quality attributes. Polyphasic OJIP fluorescence  transient exhibited a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity at J, I and  P phase in the upper and middle sites compared to the lower site due to variation  in soil moisture in both seasons. Values of fluorescence parameters including  minimal fluorescence, relative variable fluorescence at phase J and I, the  maximal quantum yield of photosystem II were also influenced by soil moisture in  different sites. Different sites also exhibited a significant difference in total  phenolics, flavonoid, antioxidant activity and individual anthocyanin which was  influenced by available soil moisture. The present study shows that chlorophyll  fluorescence OJIP transient can be used as a sensitive indicator to determine the  moisture stress in grape grown in a varied soil. Double cropping proved to be a  powerful technique to improve the fruit quality. This result may be useful for  the table grape growers to better utilize the vineyard soil variability with  water management to get higher yield and quality table grape under protected  condition.},

To test this new  evaluation procedure, we conducted a laboratory experiment and tested different  heating scenarios to infer soil moisture from volumetric heat capacity. Estimates  were made by analyzing the shift of the temperature amplitude at the sensing  cable and the characteristics of the response heating curve. The results were  compared with results from the calibrated infinite line source solution and in  situ water content point measurements and showed a good approximation of thermal  properties for strong and short heat pulses. Volumetric water content estimates  are similarly accurate to the results of the calibrated infinite line source  solution.

During wheat and maize maturation, soil total nitrogen  accumulation in the 0-60 cm layer was the highest under the treatment of shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer, being 8058.53 and 8299 kg N·hm(-2), respectively,  being 3.2\%-27.4\% and 4.3\%-7.2\% higher than other treatments. The treatment with  organic fertilizer addition resulted in nitrogen surplus. The shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer treatment led to the highest nitrogen surplus (13.57  kg N·hm(-2)), which was 9.52 and 0.18 kg N·hm(-2) higher than deep  tillage+organic fertilizer and no tillage+organic fertilizer treatments. Nitrate  leaching was the main way of nitrogen losses, accounting for 73.4\%-76.9\% of the  total losses. The amount of nitrate leaching was the highest in deep  tillage+organic fertilizer treatment (48.37 kg N·hm(-2)), being 18.9\%-35.1\%  higher than other treatments. Results of greenhouse gases emission during  2018-2019 showed that global warming potential was the highest under the  treatment of deep tillage+organic fertilizer, which was 33070 kg N·hm(-2), being  6.6\%-26.8\% higher than other treatments. The treatment of organic fertilizer  addition increased the emission of N(2)O and CO(2) and reduced the absorption of  CH(4). The annual grain yield was highest under the treatment of deep  tillage+organic fertilizer, which was 5.0\%-17.1\% higher than other treatments.  The crop harvest index was the highest under the treatment of shallow  tillage+organic fertilizer. The recommended cropping mode in Central Henan  Pro-vince is shallow tillage+organic fertilizer, which could ensure crop yields,  maintain soil nitrogen balance, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (Ts) is influenced by soil background and vegetation growing conditions, and the combination of Ts and vegetation indices (Vis) can  indicate the status of surface soil moisture content (SMC). In this study,  Advanced Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (ATVDI) used for monitoring SMC was  proposed on the basis of the simulation results with agricultural climate model  CUPID. Previous studies have concluded that Normalized Difference Vegetation  Index (NDVI) easily reaches the saturation point, andLeaf Area Index (LAI) was  then used instead of NDVI to estimate soil moisture content in the paper. With  LAI-Ts scatter diagram established by the simulation results of CUPID model; how  Ts varied with LAI and SMC was found. In the case of the identical soil  background, the logarithmic relations between Ts and LAI were more accurate than  the linear relations included in Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI),  based on which ATVDI was then developed. LAI-Ts scatter diagram with satellite  imagery were necessary for determining the expression of the upper and lower  logarithmic curves while ATVDI was used for monitoring SMC. Ts derived from  satellite imagery were then transformed to the Ts-value which has the same SMC  and the minimum LAI in study area with look-up table. The measured SMC from the  field sites in Weihe Plain, Shanxi Province, China, and the products of LAI and  Ts (MOD15A2 and MOD11A2, respectively) produced by the image derived from  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) were collected to validate the  new method proposed in this study. The validation results shown that ATVDI (R² =  0.62) was accurate enough to monitor SMC, and it achieved better result than  TVDI. Moreover, ATVDI-derived result were Ts values with some physical meanings,  which made it comparative in different periods. Therefore, ATVDI is a promising  method for monitoring SMC in different time-spatial scales in agricultural  fields.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is one of the most important indicators influencing the exchange of energy and water among vegetation, soil, and the atmosphere.  Accurate detection of soil moisture content is beneficial to improving the  precision of crop yield evaluating and field management measures. In this paper,  a novel method ADI (Angle Dryness Index) based on NIR-RED spectral feature space  used for calculating SMC was proposed, which improved the accuracy of calculating  SMC with red and near infrared band reflectance. It was found that an  intermediate parameter θ in NIR-RED feature space was significantly related to  SMC, and independent of vegetation coverage according to the linear decomposition  of mixed pixel and the empirical correlation between SMC and red/NIR band  reflectance which were achieved by previous researches. Then, ADI was proposed  with the feature discovered in the paper. The mathematical expression on SMC is  nonlinear, and the newton iterative method is applied to ADI for calculation SMC.  Then, the newly proposed method was validated with two kinds of remote sensing  imagery data (Thematic Mapper (TM) and moderate resolution imaging spectrometer  (MODIS)) and the synchronous observed data in the field. Validation results  revealed that the ADI- derived SMC was highly accordant with the in-situ results  with high correlation (R2=0.74 with TM and R2=0.64 with MODIS data). We also  calculated MPDI (Modified Perpendicular Drought Index) developed by Ghulam, which  is also proposed with the red and near infrared reflectance. The result showed  that the accuracy of MPDI was lower than that of ADI. The most likely reason was  that ADI was insensitive to fv, but the calculation errors of fv would reduce the  accuracy of SMC estimation. MODIS had a low spatial resolution, thus there may be  more than two end members in a mixed pixel. In this case, the linear  decomposition of mixed pixel was not applicable and the errors would finally be  enlarged. ADI achieved good results in monitoring SMC in vegetated area because  it was less influenced by vegetation coverage than other similar approaches. ADI  only requires the satellite image data including the red and near infrared band  which are available from most of the optical sensors. Therefore, it is an  effective and promising method for monitoring SMC in vegetated area, and would be  widely used in agriculture, meteorology, and hydrology.},

	abstract = {Soil volumetric water content (θ) is a parameter describing one of the most important factors conditioning proper plant growth. Monitoring soil moisture is  of particular importance in the rational use of water resources for irrigation,  especially during periods of water scarcity. This paper presents a method of  measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system by means of a  probe designed to be mounted on a mobile device used for precise plant  irrigation. Due to the specific field conditions of the measurement, the design  of the probe was proposed as a monopole antenna. Electromagnetic simulations of  the probe were carried out with Ansys HFSS software to optimise its dimensions.  Then a prototype of the probe was manufactured to conduct laboratory measurements  with the use of a vector network analyser (VNA) working in the 20 kHz to 8 GHz  frequency range. The VNA analyser was configured to work in the time-domain  reflectometry (TDR) mode. From measurements of the time distance between  reflections from the probe's elements it is possible to calculate the bulk  dielectric permittivity of the soil surrounding the probe. Next, based on  commonly used soil moisture dielectric calibrations one can determine θ of the  soil sample. The paper presents simulation results and laboratory tests of an  antenna probe. Due to its tough and durable design, this type of probe gives the  possibility of easy application in field conditions, which makes it especially  suitable for mechanically demanding measurement systems. As the sensitivity zone  is comparatively large, this probe is well-suited to measuring soil moisture in  the vicinity of the plant root system.},

A similar trend was observed for various soil ammonia oxidizing  bacteria, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

The novel ATPS consists of an aluminum oxide tube with a diameter  of 5 mm, an optical fiber containing a quasi-distributed FBG sensors, a  "U"-shaped resistance wire, and a flange. There are four 0.9-mm diameter holes in  the ATPS. Laboratory experiments were carried out to calibrate the relationship  between the thermal response of ATPS and the soil moisture content. Two  laboratory rainfall validation model tests were performed to validate the ATPS  for capturing the soil moisture profile in highway slopes and subgrades. During  the validations, the accuracy of the ATPS was quantified, and water infiltration  through grassy and grassless ground surfaces were investigated. The calibrations  indicate that the ATPS can detect and record real-time changes in the highway  slope and subgrade moisture after rainfall, and reveal the most dangerous zones  that occur at the connection between different construction materials. The  average measurement accuracy of soil moisture monitoring was 0.015 m³/m³. Please  note that the connection is where cracks form easily and the soil hydraulic  conductivity increases significantly. The test results also indicate that grassy  cover (lawn) significantly prevents water infiltration during the first few  minutes of rainfall (twelve minutes in this study), after which, however, the  infiltration rate drops sharply. The influence of lawn on water infiltration  depends on the soil structure, hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall time. In  summary, due to its small size and fast detection, the ATPS is a portable probe  that can be used for moisture monitoring in highway slopes and subgrades.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of trace elements in wheat grain sampled between 1967 and 2003 from the Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments were analyzed using ICP-MS.  The long-term effect of inorganic and organic fertilization on trace metal  concentrations was investigated including the impact of atmospheric deposition  and myccorhiza, whereas other factors such as soil conditions, crop cultivar,  etc. are not discussed in this paper. Mean values derived from 10 experimental  sites were reported. Significantly declining Pb and Cd concentrations in wheat  grain could be explained by lower atmospheric deposition. Mean Se contents in all  samples were 0.031 mg kg(-1) grain dry weight. No samples had sufficiently high  Se concentrations for human (0.05 mg Se kg(-1)) or animal demand (0.1 mg Se  kg(-1)). Concentrations of Co in wheat grain were extremely low, 0.002-0.005 mg  Co kg(-1) grain dry weight, and far below the minimum levels required by animals,  which applied to all fertilizer treatments. A doubling of Mo concentrations in  grain since 1975 resulted in Cu/Mo ratios often below one, which may cause  molybdenosis in ruminants. The increase in Mo concentrations in crops correlated  with the decline in sulfur deposition. Concentrations of Cu and Fe declined in  NPK-fertilized wheat as compared to unfertilized or manure-treated wheat. Very  low concentrations of Se and Co and low concentrations of Fe and Cu require  attention to counteract risks for deficiencies. The main characteristic of the  study is that there are few significant changes over time between different  fertilizer treatments, but throughout there are low concentrations of most trace  elements in all treatments. In general, good agreement between concentrations in  wheat from the long-term fertility experiments and the national monitoring  program indicate that values are representative.},

Results showed that, although treatment effects on dryland  wheat grain yield was not significant, but maximum grain yield (2484 kg ha(-1))  was obtained from application of rye green manure along with 26 kg N ha(-1);  which is 22\% more than check (without rye green manure) treatment. Green manure  application with or without nitrogen increased EC (dS m(-1)), but decreased OC, P  (av.), Cu (av.), Mn (av.), Zn (av.) and sand in the soil. In contrast to green  manure, application of nitrogen along with green manure increased saturation and  clay. In the stage of stem appearance, soil moisture content decreased 8\% in  green-manure application but with nitrogen application the moisture increased 6\%  compared with check in 0-20 cm depth. It can be concluded that, green manure  application is useful along with nitrogen fertilizer application in long term.  This treatment could increase soil moisture content, which leads to higher wheat  grain yield in dryland areas. In addition, green manure application could change  some soil characteristics such as soil TNV\%, which decreases availability of some  essential nutrients for dryland wheat.},

Currently,  there are a variety of monitoring techniques to measure, directly or indirectly,  the soil moisture. However, some practical issues remain open like the definition  a priori of the number, location and depth of the monitoring points, and the  impact of failing or poor performance soil moisture sensors. Here, we present a  set of techniques, namely Δθ time series, wavelet filtering, and time stability,  to identify representative points and monitoring depths through an analysis of  hourly soil moisture time series for different configuration of the monitoring  network. We used real data from a monitoring network consisting of seven  monitoring points, each one with four EC-5 probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman,  WA) at 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm. The use of simple time series of Δθ allowed us to  assess the spatiotemporal influence of the monitoring points, while the wavelet  periodograms allowed us to get insight about the response of the monitoring  points at different time scales. Both methods are easy to implement or adapt to  specific conditions, being coherent to the results derived from time stability  analysis. For our case study, we concluded that we could reallocate 16 sensors  (out of 28) without a significant loss of information. However, the final  decision strongly relies on a deep knowledge of the site features and the  objectives of the monitoring network.},

By  combing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the land-surface  process model SHAW (Simultaneous Heat and Water), the soil and vegetation  parameters that are related to the soil moisture but difficult to obtain by  observations are optimized using three datasets. On this basis, the SHAW model  was run with the optimized parameters to simulate the characteristics of the  land-surface process in the semi-arid loess plateau. Simultaneously, the default  SHAW model was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison test.  Simulation results revealed the following: parameters optimized by the particle  swarm optimization algorithm in all simulation tests improved simulations of the  soil moisture and latent heat flux; differences between simulated results and  observational data are clearly reduced, but simulation tests involving the  adoption of optimized parameters cannot simultaneously improve the simulation  results for the net radiation, sensible heat flux, and soil temperature.  Optimized soil and vegetation parameters based on different datasets have the  same order of magnitude but are not identical; soil parameters only vary to a  small degree, but the variation range of vegetation parameters is large.},

	abstract = {When soil moisture is heterogeneous, sap flow from, and ABA status of, different parts of the root system impact on leaf xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]leaf).  The robustness of a model for predicting [X-ABA]leaf was assessed. 'Two root-one  shoot' grafted sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants received either deficit  irrigation (DI, each root system received the same irrigation volumes) or partial  rootzone drying (PRD, only one root system was watered and the other dried the  soil). Irrespective of whether relative sap flow was assessed using sap flow  sensors in vivo or by pressurization of de-topped roots, each root system  contributed similarly to total sap flow during DI, while sap flow from roots in  drying soil declined linearly with soil water potential (Psisoil) during PRD.  Although Psisoil of the irrigated pot determined the threshold Psisoil at which  sap flow from roots in drying soil decreased, the slope of this decrease was  independent of the wet pot Psisoil. Irrespective of whether sap was collected  from the wet or dry root system of PRD plants, or a DI plant, root xylem ABA  concentration increased as Psisoil declined. The model, which weighted ABA  contributions of each root system according to the sap flow from each, almost  perfectly explained [X-ABA] immediately above the graft union. That the model  overestimated measured [X-ABA]leaf may result from changes in [X-ABA] along the  transport pathway or an artefact of collecting xylem sap from detached leaves.  The implications of declining sap flow through partially dry roots during PRD for  the control of stomatal behaviour and irrigation scheduling are discussed.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopy technique is one of the qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques developed quickly in recent years. The spectral analysis is a fast and  non-destructive method and has been used in many fields such as oil industry,  food industry and so on. In the present paper, the spectral band sensitive to  soil moisture content was found from the visible/near infrared spectra and a  monadic linear regression model based on the data of sensitive spectral band was  applied to develop a method for rapid detection of soil moisture content. The  spectral data of 52 soil samples were collected by using FieldSpec HandHeld  spectroradiometer made by ASD (Analytical Spectral Device) company in the US, and  the data of soil moisture content were obtained by experiment. The spectral band  sensitive to soil moisture content was achieved by correlation coefficient  method. Then, the data of sensitive spectral band were used to build monadic  linear regression model of soil moisture content. Finally, the model was employed  for the prediction of soil moisture content. Correlation coefficient (r) of  prediction and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were used as the  evaluation standards. The results indicated that the r and RMSEP for the  prediction of soil moisture content were 0.966 5 and 0.012 1 respectively. Thus,  it is concluded that the method used in this paper is an available method for the  rapid detection of soil moisture content based on the visible/near-infrared  spectra.},

It is a key factor to determine the water status of terrestrial  ecosystems, and is also the main source of water supply for crops. In order to  estimate soil moisture at different soil depths at a station scale, based on the  energy balance equation and the water deficit index (WDI), a soil moisture  estimation model was established in terms of the remote sensing data (the  normalized difference vegetation index and surface temperature) and air  temperature. The soil moisture estimation model was validated based on the data  from the drought process experiment of summer maize (Zea mays) responding to  different irrigation treatments carried out during 2014 at Gucheng  eco-agrometeorological experimental station of China Meteorological  Administration. The results indicated that the soil moisture estimation model  developed in this paper was able to evaluate soil relative humidity at different  soil depths in the summer maize field, and the hypothesis was reasonable that  evapotranspiration deficit ratio (i.e., WDI) linearly depended on soil relative  humidity. It showed that the estimation accuracy of 0-10 cm surface soil moisture  was the highest (R(2)=0.90). The RMAEs of the estimated and measured soil  relative humidity in deeper soil layers (up to 50 cm) were less than 15\% and the  RMSEs were less than 20\%. The research could provide reference for drought  monitoring and irrigation management.},

The objectives of this study were to: (i) establish site-specific laboratory  calibration equations of three single capacitance sensors (EC-20, EC-10, and  ML2x) for tropical soils, and (ii) evaluate the accuracy and precision of these  sensors. Intact soil cores and bulk samples, collected from the top 20 and 80 cm  soil depths at five locations across the Upper Mākaha Valley watershed, were  analyzed to determine their soil bulk density (ρ(b)), total porosity (θ(t)),  particle size distribution, and electrical conductivity (EC). Laboratory  calibration equations were established using soil packed columns at six water  content levels (0-0.5 cm(3) cm(-3)). Soil bulk density and θ(t) significantly  varied with sampling depths; whereas, soil clay content (CC) and EC varied with  sampling locations. Variations of ρ(b) and θ(t) at the two depths significantly  affected the EC-20 and ML2x laboratory calibration functions; however, there was  no effect of these properties on calibration equation functions of EC-10. There  was no significant effect of sampling locations on the laboratory calibration  functions suggesting watershed-specific equations for EC-20 and ML2x for the two  depths; a single watershed-specific equation was needed for EC-10 for both  sampling depths. The laboratory calibration equations for all sensors were more  accurate than the corresponding default equations. ML2x exhibited better  precision than EC-10, followed by EC-20. We conclude that the laboratory  calibration equations can mitigate the effects of varying soil properties and  improve the sensors' accuracy for water content measurements.},

Hence, the estimation of soil moisture is very valuable in the social, economic,  humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. Extensive  efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify  this complex variable are ongoing. This study aims at developing a new index, the  Thermal Ground cover Moisture Index (TGMI), for estimating soil moisture content.  This index is based on empirical parameterization of the relationship between raw  image digital count (DC) data in the thermal infrared spectral band and ground  cover (determined from raw image digital count data in the red and near-infrared  spectral bands).The index uses satellite-derived information only, and the  potential for its operational application is therefore great. This study was  conducted in 18 commercial agricultural fields near Lubbock, TX (USA). Soil  moisture was measured in these fields over two years and statistically compared  to corresponding values of TGMI determined from Landsat image data. Results  indicate statistically significant correlations between TGMI and field  measurements of soil moisture (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.05, MBE = 0.17 and AAE =  0.049), suggesting that soil moisture can be estimated using this index.

Under the DF treatment, the hydrolysis rate, nitrification  rate and migration depth of urea were higher or larger than that under the GF  treatment, and more N accumulated in deep soil as the N application rate  increased. Considering the distribution characteristics of fine roots and soil N,  DF would be a better fertilization method in P. xeuramericana cv.

When the N application rate was 50 g · tree(-1) each time, nitrogen mainly  distributed in the zone of fine roots and had no risk of deep leaching,  consequently improving the fertilizer utilization efficiency.},

	issn = {1001-9332},
	abstract = {Characteristics of soil nitrogen loss were investigated based on field experiments in two types of poplar-amaranth intercropping systems (spacing: L1 2  m x 5 m, L2 2 m x 15 m) with four N application rates, i. e., 0 (N1), 91 (N2),  137 (N3) and 183 (N4) kg · hm(-2). The regulation effects on the soil surface  runoff, leaching loss and soil erosion were different among the different types  of intercropping systems: L1 {\textgreater} L2 {\textgreater} L3 (amaranth monocropping). Compared with the  amaranth monocropping, the soil surface runoff rates of L1 and L2 decreased by  65.1\% and 55.9\%, the soil leaching rates of L1 and L2 with a distance of 0.5 m  from the poplar tree row de- creased by 30.0\% and 28.9\%, the rates with a  distance of 1. 5 m decreased by 25. 6\% and 21.9\%, and the soil erosion rates  decreased by 65.0\% and 55.1\%, respectively. The control effects of two  intercropping systems on TN, NO(3-)-N and NH(4+)-N in soil runoff and leaching  loss were in the order of L1 {\textgreater} L2 {\textgreater} L3. Compared with the amaranth monocropping,  TN, NO(3-)-N and NH(4+)-N loss rates in soil runoff of L1 decreased by 62.9\%,  45.1\% and 69.2\%, while the loss rates of L2 decreased by 23.4\%, 6.9\% and 46.2\%  under N1 (91 kg · hm(-2)), respectively. High- er tree-planting density and  closer positions to the polar tree row were more effective on controlling the  loss rates of NO(3-)-N and NH(4+)-N caused by soil leaching. The loss proportion  of NO(3-)-N in soil runoff decreased with the increasing nitrogen rate under the  same tree-planting density, while that of NH(4+)-N increased. Leaching loss of  NO(3-)-N had a similar trend with that of NH(4+)-N, i. e. , N3 {\textgreater} N2 {\textgreater} N1 {\textgreater} N0.},

Firstly, some representative sampling areas in a definite region should be  selected, based on the relevant hypsographic maps and airscapes. During the  course of sampling soil and plant, a field survey related to the sampling sites  should be carried out to understand the natural affecting factors on the soil  nutrient cycling in a regional agro-ecosystem scale. Moreover, the farmers' basic  status, crop production, and applied amount of fertilizers and their allotment  should be also investigated. A case study of nutrient cycling in subtropical  regions of China was carried out to approach the application of the method in the  study of soil nutrient cycling in some regions.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity is a critical factor influencing rain-fed agricultural production on the Loess Plateau, and the exploitation of rainwater is an effective avenue to  alleviate water scarcity in this area. This study was conducted to investigate  the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in the 0-300 cm under a  21-year-old apple orchard with the rainwater collection and infiltration (RWCI)  system by using a time domain reflectometer (TDR) probe on the Loess Plateau. The  results showed that there was a low soil moisture zone in the 40-80 cm under the  CK, and the RWCI system significantly increased soil moisture in this depth  interval. Over this depth, the annual average soil moisture under RWCI(40),  RWCI(60) and RWCI(80) was 39.2\%, 47.2\% and 29.1\% higher than that of bare slope  (BS) and 75.3\%, 85.4\% and 62.7\% higher than that of CK, respectively. The maximum  infiltration depth of water under RWCI(40), RWCI(60) and RWCI(80) was 80 cm, 120  cm and 180 cm, respectively, and the soil moisture in the 0-60, 0-100 and 0-120  cm was more affected by RWCI(40), RWCI(60) and RWCI(80), respectively. Over the  whole growth period of apple tree, the maximum value of soil moisture content in  the 0-300 cm existed in the RWCI(80) treatment, followed by the RWCI(40) and  RWCI(60) treatments. Overall, the RWCI system is an effective meaning of  transforming rainwater to available water resources and realizing efficient use  of agricultural water on the Loess Plateau.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a  method to predict soil P concentrations by visual and near-infrared spectroscopy  using reference P concentrations determined by diffusive gradients in thin films  (DGT); Olsen P results were included for comparison. The study was conducted on  paddy soils from six main rice-producing ( L.) provinces in southern China. Using  DGT P as a reference resulted in a better visual and near-infrared calibration to  predict soil P concentrations, as compared with using Olsen P.},

	abstract = {Soil stratified sampling method and potassium chemical fractionation analysis were used to investigate effects of long-term shallow tillage and straw returning  on soil K contents and stratification ratios in winter wheat/summer maize  rotation system in Guanzhong Plain of Northwest China. The results showed that  after 13-year continuous shallow tillage and straw returning, surface  accumulation and stratification effect obviously occurred for soil available K  (SAK) and non-exchangeable K (NEK), which was particularly remarkable for SAK and  its fractions. Serious depletion of SAK occurred in 15-30 cm soil layer, and the  SAK value was lower than the critical value of soil potassium deficiency.  Meanwhile, significant differences were found between SR1 and SR2 values of SAK  and its fractions, SR was obtained by values of topsoil layer (0-5 cm) divided by  corresponding values of lower soil layers (5-15 cm layer, SR1, or 15-30 cm layer,  SR2). However, no significant difference was observed between SR values of NEK  and mineral K. In conclusion, returning of all straw over 10 years in the winter  wheat/summer maize rotation system contributed greatly to maintaining soil K pool  balance, while special attention should be paid to the negative effects of  surface accumulation and stratification of SAK on soil K fertility.},

	volume = {25},
	issn = {1001-9332},
	abstract = {Soil moisture products derived from microwave remote sensing data are commonly used in the studies of large-scale water resources or climate change. However,  the spatial resolutions of these products are usually too coarse to be used in  regional- or watershed-scale studies. Therefore, it is necessary to spatially  downscale the coarse-resolution soil moisture products for use in regional- or  watershed-scale studies. The UCLA method is one of the methods for spatially  downscaling soil moisture products. In this method, the spatial indices (Ts/VI  indices) calculated from land surface temperature and vegetation index are used  as auxiliary variables for spatial downscaling. In this paper, we compared the  performance of the UCLA method for spatially downscaling the coarse-resolution  AMSR-E soil moisture products, using three Ts/VI indices as auxiliary variables,  i. e., the soil wetness index (SW), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI),  and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI). These auxiliary variables were  calculated from the products of MODIS land surface temperature (MYD11A1) and  MODIS vegetation index (MYD13A2). The downscaled results using the three Ts/VI  indices were all reasonable. However, the downscaled results using TVDI and VTCI  were better than using SW. Therefore, we concluded that TVDI and VTCI are more  suitable than SW to be used as the auxiliary variable when applying the UCLA  method for downscaling soil moisture products. Finally, we discussed the error  sources of applying the UCLA method, such as measurement errors of coarse  resolution soil products, calculation errors from spatial indices, and errors  from the UCLA method itself, and we also discussed the potential improvements of  future research.},

	abstract = {With the combination of field survey and EPIC modeling, this paper simulated the restoration effect of soil moisture in different alfalfa (Medicago sativa)-grain  rotation systems in semi-arid and drought-prone regions of Loess Plateau. In  perennial alfalfa field and in grain crop field after alfalfa, the correlation  coefficients between the simulated and observed values of soil moisture content  in 0-10 m layer were larger than 0.9 (P {\textless} 0.01), and their relative root mean  square errors were between 0.05 and 0.16, with the relative errors less than 10\%.  The dynamic changes of the simulated soil moisture contents in different soil  layers were consistent with those of the observed values. In the study regions,  it was difficult for the restoration of soil moisture in the deep soil layers of  alfalfa field. During the cultivation of alfalfa, the soil moisture content in  the layers at 8-10 m depth should not be less than 5.7\%. Considering the  sustainable development of agricultural production, the appropriate cultivation  duration of alfalfa should be 4-6 years and no more than 8 years. For the  restoration of soil moisture after alfalfa cultivation in the study regions, the  rotation system potato (Solanum tuberosum) --{\textgreater} potato --{\textgreater} spring wheat (Triticum  aestivum) could be adopted, and alfalfa could be cultivated again after 32-33  years.},
